THE FIRST EDITION In recent years, introductory physical metallurgy textbooks
have attempted to achieve three goals: to explain basic metallurgical phenomena, to
identify the compositions and properties of commercial alloys, and to teach principles ofmetal fabrication. Because all three phases are generally covered in a single course ofone or two semesters, none of them receives adequate treatment. A natural questionthat arises is which of the three is most generally important to the engineering student.In this regard, it should be pointed out that metal fabrication and alloy properties areﬁelds that are characteristically factual in nature. Although, strong arguments can bepresented for including these areas of study, it must still be admitted that time spentlearning large numbers of apparently unrelated facts is frequently wasted. Informationof this sort is easily forgotten and, what is more, today's alloys and methods are notnecessarily those of tomorrow. On the other hand, the theoretical approach to physicalmetallurgy is premised on the belief that the properties of metals and alloys are deter-mined by simple physical laws, and that it is not necessary to consider each alloy as aseparate entity. Recent advances in the physics and chemistry of metals have gone fartoward ﬁnding the needed interrelations.
This book is intended for use as an introductory course (of one or two semesters) in
physical metallurgy and is designed for all engineering students at the junior or seniorlevel. A number of chapters dealing with advanced topics, such as Chapters 10, 11, 15,and 19 may be omitted in their entirety when the book is used for a one-semestercourse. Prerequisites are college physics, chemistry, and strength of materials. An engi-neering course in thermodynamics or physical chemistry is also considered desirable butnot essential. The approach is largely theoretical, but all major phases of metal behaviornormally found in physical metallurgy textbooks are covered. In this respect, statisticalmechanics and dislocation theory are used to explain plastic deformation and thermaleffects in metals. Vacancies are treated in some detail because their study may be usedto obtain a true appreciation for the meaning of activation energies in metals.Deformation twinning is given considerable attention not only because this type ofdeformation has become increasingly more important, but also because twinning theoryleads directly into the important subject area of martensite transformations.
On the whole, it is believed that the treatment used in this book is in harmony with
current trends toward a more fundamental approach in engineering education.
The author would like to acknowledge that the lectures of Dr. A. S. Nowick
and Dr. W. D. Robertson at the Hammond Laboratory, Yale University, were largelyinstrumental in inspiring the writing of this book. The helpful suggestions from Dr. F. N. Rhines on the subject of creep are also gratefully acknowledged.

are continued in this volume. The major changes in the new edition are largely thePreface

University, Dean Walter S. Owen, of Northwestern University, and Professor MarvinMetzger, of the University of Illinois. One result of these suggestions is the inclusion ofa chapter on nucleation and growth kinetics. The outline of this chapter was alsoinspired by a set of class notes kindly loaned to the author by Professor Heckel. Theconsiderable assistance of Dr. John Kronsbein in revising and expanding Chapter 3,Elementary Theory of Metals, is also gratefully acknowledged.
As a consequence of requests for the inclusion of topics either missing or too lightly
covered in the ﬁrst edition, the new book has been increased in size by about ten per-cent. In a broad sense, the additional material ﬁts into two classiﬁcations. First are thetopics that have recently become signiﬁcant in the ﬁeld of metallurgy. The secondgroup consists of well-established subjects not covered in the ﬁrst edition, but which,from use of the text, were found to be needed for a more uniﬁed presentation. Amongthe former subject areas are electron microscopy, fracture mechanics, superconductiv-ity, superplasticity, dynamic recovery, dynamic strain aging, electrotransport, thermalmigration, and emissary dislocations. In the latter category belong the new chapter onnucleation and growth kinetics and such topics as magnetism, the zone theory of alloyphases, the ﬁve degrees of freedom of a grain boundary, the phase rule, true stress andtrue strain, coring and homogenization of castings, work hardening, and diffusion innonisomorphic systems.
The number of problems is substantially increased over that in the original book, in
conformity with the current trend in engineering to place more emphasis on problemsolving. Problems have been written with the aim of both illustrating points covered in thetext and exposing the student to material and concepts not covered directly in the book.
The helpful assistance of Dr. John Hren, Dr. Robert T. DeHoff, Dr. Derek Dove,
Dr. Ellis Verink, and Dr. E. N. Rhines, all of the University of Florida, who either reviewedsections of the book or gave suggestions, is acknowledged with thanks.
THE THIRD EDITION The basic philosophy underlying the original edition is
retained in the third edition. However, a number of significant improvements havebeen incorporated in the third edition. The International System of Units is nowemployed throughout text and problems. A chapter devoted to important non-ferrous metal has been added. Fracture mechanics is covered in much greater depthand breadth in a separate chapter. The treatment of solidification has been expandedand brought up to date and includes an extensive coverage of liquid metals as wellas the Scheil equation and eutectic freezing. The section on the transmission electronmicroscope has been expanded and a detailed discussion of the scanning electronmicroscope has been added. Grain boundaries are now covered in a separate chapterthat includes coincident site boundaries. The subject of dislocations has been reor-ganized and consolidated. Chapter 4 considers the geometrical aspects of dislocationswhile Chapter 5 treats the relationship of dislocations to plastic deformation. Thephase diagrams in the text have been brought up to date. In the steel chapters, thetransformations of austenite to peariite, bainite, and martensite, and the temperingof martensite have been modernized. In the deformation twinning and martensitereactions chapter, less emphasis is placed on twinning phenomena per se while therole that twinning can play in the plastic deformation of polycrystalline metals hasbeen added. In the martensite section, thermoelastic deformation and shape memoryeffects are now covered.00FM.qxd  11/6/08  3:28 PM  Page xvi

THE FOURTH EDITION The original philosophy of the former editions has
been kept in this fourth edition. The text retains its easy-to-read format so that theessence of the information is most successfully communicated. Recent references havebeen incorporated to complement the remaining original references which provide his-toric context. Indeed, with electronic search engines limited to more recently publishedliterature, identiﬁcation and acknowledgment of the pioneers of the ﬁeld often getsoverlooked. To increase the focus of the text, Chapters 22 and 23 were removed, withsalient portions incorporated into other chapters. As such, the book is more adaptablefor a one or two semester introductory course for juniors or seniors in materials scienceand engineering. New ﬁgures were added to enhance understanding of the text.Sections on nano-structures have been included to demonstrate the applicability of thephysical metallurgy principles to current nanotechnology trends; however, the authorsleave it to the readers to independently pursue the area more thoroughly.

The Structure of Metals
The most important aspect of any engineering material is its structure, because its
properties are closely related to this feature. To be successful, a materials engineer musthave a good understanding of this relationship between structure and properties. By wayof illustration, wood is a very easy material in which to see the close interaction betweenstructure and properties. A typical structural wood, such as southern yellow pine, is essen-tially an array of long hollow cells or ﬁbers. These ﬁbers, which are formed largely fromcellulose, are aligned with the grain of the wood and are cemented together by anotherweaker organic material called lignin. The structure of wood is thus roughly analogous tothat of a bundle of drinking straws. It can be split easily along its grain; that is, parallel tothe cells. Wood is also much stronger in compression (or tension) parallel to its grain thanit is in compression (or tension) perpendicular to the grain. It makes excellent columnsand beams, but it is not really suitable for tension members required to carry large loads,because the low resistance of wood to shear parallel to its grain makes it difﬁcult to attachend fastenings that will not pull out. As a result, wooden bridges and other large woodenstructures are often constructed containing steel tie rods to support the tensile loads.
1.1 THE STRUCTURE OF METALS
The structure in metals is of similar importance to that in wood, although often in a moresubtle manner. Metals are usually crystalline when in the solid form. While very large sin-gle crystals can be prepared, the normal metallic object consists of an aggregate of manyvery small crystals. Metals are therefore polycrystalline . The crystals in these materials are
normally referred to as its grains. Because of their very small sizes, an optical microscope,operating at magniﬁcations between about 100 and 1000 times, is usually used to examinethe structural features associated with the grains in a metal. Structures requiring this rangeof magniﬁcation for their examination fall into the class known as microstructures .
Occasionally, metallic objects, such as castings, may have very large crystals that arediscernible to the naked eye or are easily resolved under a low-power microscope. Structurein this category is called macrostructure . On the other hand, there are materials whose grains
or sizes are much ﬁner and in the nanoscale range. These microstructures are commonlyreferred to as nanostructure, with scales on the order of one billionth of a meter. It shouldbe noted that nanoscale features can be in one dimension, as in nanosurfaces or nanoﬁlms;in two dimensions, as in nanotubes or whiskers; or in three dimensions, as in nanoparti-cles. Nanoprecipitates such as Guinier and Preston (GP) Zones have been used for decadesfor precipitation hardening of aluminum alloys, as discussed in Chapter 16. Finally, there isthe basic structure inside the grains themselves: that is, the atomic arrangements inside thecrystals. This form of structure is logically called the crystal structure .
Of the various forms of structure, microstructure (that visible under the optical
microscope) has been historically of the greatest use and interest to the metallurgist.Because the metallurgical microscope is normally operated at magniﬁcations where its

lattice. (C)Cut view of a unit celldepth of ﬁeld is extremely shallow, the metallic surface to be observed must be very ﬂat.
At the same time, it must reveal accurately the nature of the structure inside the metal.
One is therefore presented with the problem of preparing a very smooth ﬂat and
undistorted surface, which is by no means an easy task. The procedures required to
obtain the desired goal fall under the general heading of metallographic specimen prepa-
ration. Detailed description of metallographic sample preparation techniques and
examples of microstructures can be found in Reference 1.
A crystal is deﬁned as an orderly array of atoms in space. There are many different
types of crystal structures, some of which are quite complicated. Fortunately, most met-
als crystallize in one of three relatively simple structures: the face-centered cubic, the
body-centered cubic, and the close-packed hexagonal.
1.2 UNIT CELLS
The unit cell of a crystal structure is the smallest group of atoms possessing the symmetry
of the crystal which, when repeated in all directions, will develop the crystal lattice.
Figure 1.1A shows the unit cell of the body-centered cubic lattice. It is evident that its
name is derived from the shape of the unit cell. Eight unit cells are combined in Fig. 1.1B
in order to show how the unit cell ﬁts into the complete lattice. Note that atom aof
Fig. 1.1B does not belong uniquely to one unit cell, but is a part of all eight unit cells that
surround it. Therefore, it can be said that only one-eighth of this corner atom belongs to
any one-unit cell. This fact may be used to compute the number of atoms per unit cell in
a body-centered cubic crystal. Even a small crystal will contain billions of unit cells, and
the cells in the interior of the crystal must greatly exceed in number those lying on the
surface. Therefore, surface cells may be neglected in our computations. In the interior of
a crystal, each corner atom of a unit cell is equivalent to atom aof Fig. 1.1B and con-
tributes one-eighth of an atom to a unit cell. In addition, each cell also possesses an atom
located at its center that is not shared with other unit cells. The body-centered cubic lat-
tice thus has two atoms per unit cell; one contributed by the corner atoms, and one
located at the center of the cell, as shown in Fig. 1.1C.
The unit cell of the face-centered cubic lattice is shown in Fig. 1.2. In this case, the
unit cell has an atom in the center of each face. The number of atoms per unit cell in the
face-centered cubic lattice can be computed in the same manner as in the body-centered01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 2

FIG. 1.3 Hard-ball model of the body-centered
cubic unit cellcubic lattice. The eight corner atoms again contribute one atom to the cell, as shown in
Fig. 1.2B. There are also six face-centered atoms to be considered, each a part of two unit
cells. These contribute six times one-half an atom, or three atoms. The face-centered
cubic lattice has a total of four atoms per unit cell, or twice as many as the body-centered
cubic lattice.
1.3 THE BODY-CENTERED CUBIC STRUCTURE (BCC)
It is frequently convenient to consider metal crystals as structures formed by stacking
together hard spheres. This leads to the so-called hard-ball model of a crystalline lattice,
where the radius of the spheres is taken as half the distance between the centers of the
most closely spaced atoms.
Figure 1.3 shows the hard-ball model of the body-centered cubic (bcc) unit cell.
A study of the ﬁgure shows that the atom at the center of the cube is colinear with each
corner atom; that is, the atoms connecting diagonally opposite corners of the cube form
straight lines, each atom touching the next in sequence. These linear arrays do not end
at the corners of the unit cell, but continue on through the crystal much like a row of
beads strung on a wire (see Fig. 1.1B). These four cube diagonals constitute the close-
packed directions of the body-centered cubic crystal, directions that run continuously
through the lattice on which the atoms are as closely spaced as possible.01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 3
Chapter 1 The Structure of Metals 4
Further consideration of Figs. 1.3 and 1.1B reveals that all atoms in the body-
centered cubic lattice are equivalent. Thus, the atom at the center of the cube of Fig. 1.3
has no special signiﬁcance over those occupying corner positions. Each of the latter
could have been chosen as the center of a unit cell, making all corner atoms of Fig. 1.1B
centers of cells, and all centers of cells corners.
1.4 COORDINATION NUMBER OF THE BODY-CENTERED
CUBIC LATTICE
The coordination number of a crystal structure equals the number of nearest neighbors
that an atom possesses in the lattice. In the body-centered cubic unit cell, the center
atom has eight neighbors touching it (see Fig. 1.3). We have already seen that all atoms
in this lattice are equivalent. Therefore, every atom of the body-centered cubic structure
not lying at the exterior surface possesses eight nearest neighbors, and the coordination
number of the lattice is eight.
1.5 THE FACE-CENTERED CUBIC LATTICE (FCC)
The hard-ball model assumes special significance in the face-centered cubic crystal,
for in this structure the atoms or spheres are packed together as closely as possible.
Figure 1.4A shows a complete face-centered cubic (fcc) cell, and Fig. 1.4B shows
the same unit cell with a corner atom removed to reveal a close-packed plane
(octahedral plane) in which the atoms are spaced as tightly as possible. A larger area

b cFIG. 1.5 Atomic arrangement in the octahedral
plane of a face-centered cubic metal. Notice that
the atoms have the closest possible packing. This
same conﬁguration of atoms is also observed in
the basal plane of close-packed hexagonal crystals.
The close-packed directions are aa, bb , and cc
from one of these close-packed planes is shown in Fig. 1.5. Three close-packed
directions lie in the octahedral plane (the directions aa, bb , and cc). Along these direc-
tions the spheres touch and are colinear.
Returning to Fig. 1.4A, we see that the close-packed directions of Fig. 1.5 corre-
spond to diagonals that cross the faces of the cube. There are six of these close-packed
directions in the face-centered cubic lattice, as shown in Fig. 1.4C. Face diagonals lying
on the reverse faces of the cube are not counted in this total because each is parallel to
a direction lying on a visible face, and, in considering crystallographically signiﬁcant
directions, parallel directions are the same. It should also be pointed out that the face-
centered cubic structure has four close-packed or octahedral planes. This can be
veriﬁed as follows. If an atom is removed from each of the corners of a unit cell in a
manner similar to that of Fig. 1.4B, an octahedral plane will be revealed in each
instance. There are eight of these planes, but since diagonally opposite planes are
parallel, they are crystallographically equal. This reduces the number of different
octahedral planes to four. The face-centered cubic lattice, however, is unique in that it
contains as many as four planes of closest packing, each containing three close-packed
directions. No other lattice possesses such a large number of close-packed planes and
closed-packed directions. This fact is important, since it gives face-centered cubic met-
als physical properties different from those of other metals, one of which is the ability
to undergo severe plastic deformation.
1.6 THE UNIT CELL OF THE HEXAGONAL CLOSED-PACKED
(HCP) LATTICE
The conﬁguration of atoms most frequently used to represent the hexagonal close-
packed structure is shown in Fig. 1.6. This group of atoms contains more than the
minimum number of atoms needed to form an elementary building block for the lattice;
therefore it is not a true unit cell. However, because the arrangement of Fig. 1.6 brings
out important crystallographic features, including the sixfold symmetry of the
lattice, it is commonly used as the unit cell of the close-packed hexagonal structure.01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 5

FIG. 1.7 Stacking sequences in close-packed
crystal structuresA comparison of Fig. 1.6 with Fig. 1.5 shows that the atoms in the planes at the top, bot-
tom, and center of the unit cell belong to a plane of closest packing, the basal plane of
the crystal. The ﬁgure also shows that the atoms in these basal planes have the proper
stacking sequence for the hexagonal close-packed lattice ( ABA . . .); atoms at the top of
the cell are directly over those at the bottom, while atoms in the central plane have a
different set of positions.
The basal plane of a hexagonal metal, like the octahedral plane of a face-centered
cubic metal, has three close-packed directions. These directions correspond to the lines aa,
bb, cc of Fig. 1.5.
1.7 COMPARISON OF THE FACE-CENTERED CUBIC AND 
CLOSE-PACKED HEXAGONAL STRUCTURES
The face-centered cubic lattice can be constructed by ﬁrst arranging atoms into a number
of close-packed planes, similar to that shown in Fig. 1.5, and then by stacking these planes
over each other in the proper sequence. There are a number of ways in which planes of
closest packing can be stacked. One sequence gives the close-packed hexagonal lattice,
another the face-centered cubic lattice. The reason that there is more than one way of
stacking close-packed planes is because any one plane can be set down on a previous one
in two different ways. For example, consider the close-packed plane of atoms in Fig. 1.7.
The center of each atom in the ﬁgure is indicated by the symbol A. Now, if a single atom
is placed on top of the conﬁguration of Fig. 1.7, it will be attracted by interatomic forces
into one of the natural pockets that occur between any three contiguous atoms. Suppose
that it falls into the pocket marked B1at the upper left of the ﬁgure; then a second atom
cannot be dropped into either C1or C2because the atom at B1overlaps the pocket at these
two points. However, the second atom can fall into B2or B3and start the formation of a
second close-packed plane consisting of atoms occupying all Bpositions. Alternatively, the
second plane could have been set down in such a way as to ﬁll only Cpositions. Thus if
the ﬁrst close-packed plane occupies Apositions, the second plane may occupy Bor Cposi-
tions. Let us assume that the second plane has the Bconﬁguration. Then the pockets of
the second plane fall half over the centers of the atoms in the ﬁrst plane ( Apositions) and
half over the Cpockets in the ﬁrst plane. The third plane may now be set down over the
second plane into either Aor Cpositions. If set down into Apositions, the atoms in the
third layer fall directly over atoms in the ﬁrst layer. This is not the face-centered cubic
order, but that of the close-packed hexagonal structure. The face-centered cubic stacking
order is: Afor the ﬁrst plane, Bfor the second plane, and Cfor the third plane, which mayFIG. 1.6 The
close-packed
hexagonal unit
cell01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 6
7 1.9 Anisotropy
be written as ABC. The fourth plane in the face-centered cubic lattice, however, does fall
on the Aposition, the ﬁfth on B, and the sixth on C, so that the stacking order for face-
centered cubic crystals is ABCABCABC, etc. In the close-packed hexagonal structure, the
atoms in every other plane fall directly over one another, corresponding to the stacking
order ABABAB . . . .
There is no basic difference in the packing obtained by the stacking of spheres in
the face-centered cubic or the close-packed hexagonal arrangement, since both givean ideal close-packed structure. There is, however, a marked difference between thephysical properties of hexagonal close-packed metals (such as cadmium, zinc, andmagnesium) and the face-centered cubic metals, (such as aluminum, copper, andnickel), which is related directly to the difference in their crystalline structure. Themost striking difference is in the number of close-packed planes. In the face-centeredcubic lattice there are four planes of closest packing, the octahedral planes ; but in the
close-packed hexagonal lattice only one plane, the basal plane , is equivalent to the
octahedral plane. The single close-packed plane of the hexagonal lattice engenders,among other things, plastic deformation properties that are much more directionalthan those found in cubic crystals.
1.8 COORDINATION NUMBER OF THE SYSTEMS
OF CLOSEST PACKING
The coordination number of an atom in a crystal has been defined as the number of
nearest neighbors that it possesses. This number is 12 for both face-centered cubic andclose-packed hexagonal crystals, as may be verified with the aid of Fig. 1.7. Thus, con-sider atom A
0lying in the plane of atoms shown as circles drawn with continuous
lines. Six other atoms lying in the same close-packed plane as A0are in nearest neigh-
bor positions. Atom A0also touches three atoms in the plane directly above. These
three atoms could occupy Bpositions, as is indicated by the dashed lines around pock-
ets B1, B2, and B3, or they could occupy positions C1, C2, and C3. In either case, the
number of nearest neighbors in the plane just above A0is limited to three. In the same
manner, it may be shown that A0has three nearest neighbors in the next plane below
the close-packed plane containing A0. The number of nearest neighbors of atom A0is
thus twelve: six in its own plane, three in the plane above it, and three in the planebelow it. Since the argument is valid no matter whether the atoms in the close-packedplanes just above or below atom A
0are in Bor Cpositions, it holds for both face-
centered cubic and close-packed hexagonal stacking sequences. We conclude, there-fore, that the coordination number in these lattices is 12.
1.9 ANISOTROPY
When the properties of a substance are independent of direction, the material is said to beisotropic. Thus, in an isotropic material, one should expect to ﬁnd that it has the samestrength in all directions. Or, if its electrical resistivity were measured, the same value of thisproperty would be obtained irrespective of how a resistivity specimen was cut from a quan-tity of the material. The physical properties of crystals normally depend strongly on thedirection along which they are measured. This means that, basically, crystals are notisotropic, but anisotropic. In this regard, consider a body-centered cubic crystal of iron. Thethree most important directions in this crystal are the directions labeled a, b, and cin Fig. 1.8.01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 7

FIG. 1.9 An iron crystal is much easier to magnetize along an
adirection of Fig. 1.8 than along a bor cdirection. The oppo-
site is the case for nickel2,3
That these directions are not equivalent can be recognized from the fact that the spacings of
the atoms along the three directions are different, being equal respectively, in terms of the
lattice parameter a(the length of one edge of the unit cell), to a, , and . The physi-
cal properties of iron, measured along these three directions, also tend to be different. As an
example, consider the I-Hcurve for the magnetization of iron crystals. As may be seen in
Fig. 1.9, the intensity of magnetization Irises most rapidly with the magnetic ﬁeld intensity
Halong the direction a, at an intermediate rate along b, and least rapidly along c. Interpreted
in another way, we may say that ais the direction of easiest magnetization, while cis corre-
spondingly the most difﬁcult. Another example is shown for nickel single crystals. Here the
intensity of magnetization rises rapidly in the direction cand least rapidly in direction a. It
should be noted that the above-mentioned bulk anisotropies relate to the crystal structures.
When these materials are used in thin layers having a thickness on the order of a few atomic
layers, additional anistropies related to surfaces and interfaces may also appear.4
Ideally, a polycrystalline specimen might be expected to be isotropic if its crystals were
randomly oriented, for then, from a macroscopic point of view, the anisotropy of the crys-
tals should be averaged out. However, a truly random arrangement of the crystals is seldom
achieved, because manufacturing processes tend to align the grains in a metal so that their
orientations are not uniformly distributed. The result is known as a texture or a preferred
orientation. Because most polycrystalline metals have a preferred orientation, they tend to
be anisotropic, the degree of this anisotropy depending on the degree of crystal alignment.
1.10 TEXTURES OR PREFERRED ORIENTATIONS
Wires are formed by pulling rods through successively smaller and smaller dies. In the case
of iron, this kind of deformation tends to align a bdirection of each crystal parallel to the
wire axis. About this direction the crystals are normally considered to be randomly23

FIG. 1.10 Two basic crystalline orientations that can be obtained in rolled plates of body-centered cubic metals
arranged. This type of preferred arrangement of the crystals in an iron or steel wire is quite
persistent. Even if the metal is given a heat treatment* that completely reforms the crys-
tal structure, the crystals tend to keep a bdirection parallel to the wire axis. Because the
deformation used in forming sheets and plates is basically two-dimensional in character,
the preferred orientation found in them is more restrictive than that observed in wires. As
indicated in Fig. 1.10A, not only does one tend to ﬁnd a bdirection parallel to the rolling
direction or length of the plate, but there is also a strong tendency for a cube plane, or face
of the unit cell, to be aligned parallel to the rolling plane or surface of the sheet or plate.
There are a number of reasons why an understanding of crystal properties is impor-
tant to engineers. One of these is that the basic anisotropy of crystalline materials is
reﬂected in the polycrystalline objects of commerce. It should be noted also that this is not
always undesirable. Preferred orientations can often result in materials with superior prop-
erties. An interesting example of this sort is found in the alloy of iron with 4 percent of sil-
icon, used for making transformer coils. In this case, by a complicated combination of
rolling procedures and heat treatments, it is possible to obtain a very strong preferred ori-
entation in which an adirection of the crystals is aligned parallel to the rolling direction,
while a cube plane, or face of the unit cell, remains parallel to the rolling plane. This aver-
age orientation is shown schematically in Fig. 1.10B. The signiﬁcant feature of this texture
is that it place the direction of easy magnetization parallel to the length of the sheet. In
manufacturing transformers, it is then a rather simple matter to align the plates in the core
so that this direction is parallel to the direction along which the magnetic ﬂux runs. When
this occurs, the resultant hysteresis loss can be made very small.
1.11 MILLER INDICES
As one becomes more and more involved in the study of crystals, the need for symbols to
describe the orientation in space of important crystallographic directions and planes becomes
evident. Thus, while the directions of closest packing in the body-entered cubic lattice may
be described as the diagonals that traverse the unit cell, and the corresponding directions

FIG. 1.11 The [111] and [101]
directions in a cubic crystal; direc-
tions mand n, respectivelyin the face-centered cubic lattice as the diagonals that cross the faces of a cube, it is much
easier to deﬁne these directions in terms of several simple integers. The Miller system of
designating indices for crystallographic planes and directions is universally accepted for this
purpose. In the discussion that follows, the Miller indices for cubic and hexagonal crystals
will be considered. The indices for other crystal structures are not difﬁcult to develop.
Direction Indices in the Cubic Lattice Let us take a cartesian coordinate
system with axes parallel to the edge of the unit cell of a cubic crystal. (See Fig. 1.11.) In this
coordinate system, the unit of measurement along all three axes is the length of the edge of
a unit cell, designated by the symbol ain the ﬁgure. The Miller indices of directions are intro-
duced with the aid of several simple examples. Thus the cube diagonal mof Fig. 1.11 has
the same direction as a vector twith a length that equals the diagonal distance across the
cell. The component of the vector ton each of the three coordinate axes is equal to a. Since
the unit of measurement along each axis equals a, the vector has components 1, 1 and 1 on
the x, y, and zaxes, respectively. The Miller indices of the direction mare now written [111].
In the same manner, the direction n, which crosses a face of the unit cell diagonally, has the
same direction as a vector sthe length of which is the face diagonal of the unit cell. The x, y,
and zcomponents of this vector are 1, 0 and 1 respectively; the corresponding Miller indices
are [101]. The indices of the xaxis are [100], the yaxis [010], and the zaxis [001].
A general rule for ﬁnding the Miller indices of a crystallographic direction can now be
stated. Draw a vector from the origin parallel to the direction whose indices are desired.
Make the magnitude of the vector such that its components on the three coordinate axes
have lengths that are simple integers. These integers must be the smallest numbers that
will give the desired direction. Thus, the integers 1, 1, and 1, and 2, 2, and 2 represent the
same direction in space, but, by convention, the Miller indices are [111] and not [222].
Let us apply the above rule to the determination of the Miller indices of a second cube
diagonal; that indicated by the symbol pin Fig. 1.12. The vector (which starts at the origin
in Fig. 1.12B) is parallel to the direction p. The components of qare 1, /H110021, and 1, and, by
the above deﬁnition, the corresponding Miller indices of pare [1 1], where the negative
sign of the yindex is indicated by a bar over the corresponding integer. The indices of the
diagonal min Fig. 1.12A have already been shown to be [111], and it may also be shown
that the indices of the diagonals uand vare [11 ] and [ 11]. The four cube diagonals thus
have indices [111], [ 11], [1 1], and [11 ].
When a speciﬁc crystallographic direction is referred to, the Miller indices are enclosed
in square brackets as shown here. However, it is sometimes desirable to refer to all of the1 1 11 1101Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 10

directions of the same form. In this case, the indices of one of these directions are enclosed
in carets /H20855111 /H20856, and the symbol is read to signify all four directions ([111], [ 11], [1 1],
and [11 ]), which are considered as a class. Thus, one might say that the close-packed
directions in the body-centered cubic lattice are /H20855111 /H20856directions, whereas a speciﬁc crys-
tal might be stressed in tension along its [111] direction and simultaneously compressed
along its [1 1] direction.
Cubic Indices for Planes Crystallographic planes are also identiﬁed by sets of
integers. These are obtained from the intercepts that the planes make with the coordinate
axes. Thus, in Fig. 1.13 the indicated plane intercepts the x, y, and zaxes at 1, 3, and 2 unit-
cell distances, respectively. The Miller indices are proportional not to these intercepts, but
to their reciprocals , , and, by deﬁnition, the Miller indices are the smallest integers
having the same ratios as these reciprocals. The desired integers are, therefore, 6, 2, 3.
The Miller indices of a plane are enclosed in parentheses, for example (623), instead of
brackets, thus making it possible to differentiate between planes and directions.1

(011) plane. (C)The (111) plane
Let us now determine the Miller indices of several important planes of cubic crystals.
The plane of the face aof the cube shown in Fig. 1.14A is parallel to both the yand zaxes
and, therefore, may be said to intercept these axes at inﬁnity. The xintercept, however,
equals 1, and the reciprocals of the three intercepts are , , . The corresponding Miller
indices are (100). The indices of the face bare (010), while those of care (001). The indi-
cated plane of Fig. 1.14B has indices (011), and that of Fig. 1.14C (111). The latter plane is
an octahedral plane, as may be seen by referring to Fig. 1.15. Other octahedral planes have
the indices ( 11), (1 1), and (11 ), where the bar over a digit represents a negative inter-
cept. By way of illustration, the ( 11) plane is shown in Fig. 1.15, where it may be seen that
the xintercept is negative, whereas the yand zintercepts are positive. This ﬁgure also shows
that the (1 ) plane is parallel to the ( 11) plane and is, therefore, the same crystallo-
graphic plane. Similarly, the indices ( 1 ) and ( 1) represent the same planes as (1 1) and
(11 ), respectively.
The set of planes of a given form, such as the four octahedral planes (111), (1 1), ( 11),
and (11 ), are represented as a group with the aid of braces enclosing one of the indices, that
is, {111}. Thus, if one wishes to refer to a speciﬁc plane in a crystal of known orientation,
parentheses are used, but if the class of planes is to be referred to, braces are used.
An important feature of the Miller indices of cubic crystals is that the integers of the
indices of a plane and of the direction normal to the plane are identical. Thus, face aof the
cube in Fig. 1.14A has indices (100), and the xaxis, perpendicular to this plane, has indices
[100]. In the same manner, the octahedral plane of Fig. 1.14C and its normal, the cube11 111 11 111 1111 1 11

diagonal, have indices (111) and [111], respectively. Noncubic crystals do not, in general,
possess this equivalence between the indices of planes and normals to the planes. The
spacing between crystallographic planes is covered later in Section 2.4.
Miller Indices for Hexagonal Crystals Planes and directions in
hexagonal metals are deﬁned almost universally in terms of Miller indices containing
four digits instead of three. The use of a four-digit system gives planes of the same form
similar indices. Thus, in a four-digit system, the planes (11 0) and (1 10) are equiva-
lent planes. The three-digit system, on the other hand, gives equivalent planes indices
that are not similar. Thus, the previously mentioned two planes would have indices
(110) and (1 0) in the three-digit system.
Four-digit hexagonal indices are based on a coordinate system containing four axes.
Three axes correspond to close-packed directions and lie in the basal plane of the crystal,
making 120° angles with each other. The fourth axis is normal to the basal plane and is
called the caxis, where as the three axes that lie in the basal plane are designated the a1,
a2, and a3axes. Figure 1.16 shows the hexagonal unit cell superimposed upon the four-
axis coordinate system. It is customary to take the unit of measurement along the a1, a2,
and a3axes as the distance between atoms in a close-packed direction. The magnitude of
this unit is indicated by the symbol a. The unit of measurement for the caxis is the height
of the unit cell that is designated as c.
Let us now determine the Miller indices of several important close-packed hexago-
nal lattice planes. The uppermost surface of the unit cell in Fig. 1.16 corresponds to the
basal plane of the crystal. Since it is parallel to the axes a1, a2, and a3, it must intercept
them at inﬁnity. Its caxis intercept, however, is equal to 1. The reciprocals of these inter-
cepts are , , , . The Miller indices of the basal plane are, therefore, (0001). The six
vertical surfaces of the unit cell are known as prism planes of Type 1. Consider now the
prism plane that forms the front face of the cell, which has intercepts as follows: a1at 1,
a2at /H11009, a3at /H110021, and cat /H11009. Its Miller indices are, therefore, (10 0). Another important
type of plane in the hexagonal lattice is shown in Fig. 1.17. The intercepts are a1at 1,
a2at /H11009, a3at /H110021, and cat , and the Miller indices are accordingly (10 2). 11

Chapter 1 The Structure of Metals 14
Miller indices of directions are also expressed in terms of four digits. In writing direc-
tion indices, the third digit must always equal the negative sum of the ﬁrst two digits.
Thus, if the ﬁrst two digits are 3 and 1, the third must be /H110024, that is, [31 0].
Let us investigate directions lying only in the basal plane, since this will simplify the
presentation. If a direction lies in the basal plane, then it has no component along the caxis,
and the fourth digit of the Miller indices will be zero.
As our ﬁrst example, let us ﬁnd the Miller indices of the a1axis. This axis has the
same direction as the vector sum of three vectors (Fig. 1.18), one of length /H110012 along the
a1axis, another of length /H110021 parallel to the a2axis, and the third of length /H110021 parallel to
the a3axis. The indices of this direction are, accordingly [2 0]. This unwieldy method
of obtaining the direction indices is necessary in order that the relationship mentioned
above be maintained between the ﬁrst two digits and the third. The corresponding indices
of the a2and a3axes are [ 2 0] and [ 20]. These three directions are known as the
digonal axes of Type I. Another important set of directions lying in the basal plane
are the digonal axes of Type II; a set of axes perpendicular to the digonal axes of Type I.
Figure 1.19 shows one of the axes of Type II and indicates how its direction indices are
determined. The vector sin the ﬁgure determines the desired direction and equals
the vector sum of a unit vector lying on a1, and another parallel to a3, but measured in
a negative sense. The indices of the digonal axis of Type II are thus [10 0]. In this case,
the second digit is zero because the projection of the vector son the a2axis is zero.
1.12 CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF THE METALLIC ELEMENTS
Some of the most important metals are classiﬁed according to their crystal structures in
Table 1.1.
A number of metals are polymorphic, that is, they crystallize in more than one struc-
ture. The most important of these is iron, which crystallizes as either body-centered cubic
or face-centered cubic, with each structure stable in separate temperature ranges. Thus, at
all temperatures below 911.5 °C and above 1396 °C to the melting point, the preferred
crystal structure is body-centered cubic, whereas between 911.5 °C and 1396 °C the metal111 11114–12

is stable in the face-centered cubic structure. It may also be seen in Table 1.1 that titanium
and zirconium are also polymorphic, being body-centered cubic at higher temperaturesand close-packed hexagonal at lower temperatures.
1.13 THE STEREOGRAPHIC PROJECTION
The stereographic projection is a useful metallurgical tool, for it permits the mapping intwo dimensions of crystallographic planes and directions in a convenient and straightfor-ward manner. The real value of the method is attained when it is possible to visualize crys-tallographic features directly in terms of their stereographic projections. The purpose ofthis section is to concentrate on the geometrical correspondence between crystallographicplanes and directions and their stereographic projections. In each case, a sketch of a cer-tain crystallographic feature, in terms of its location in the unit cell, is compared with itscorresponding stereographic projection.
Several simple examples will be considered, but before this is done, attention will
be called to several pertinent facts. The stereographic projection is a two-dimensionaldrawing of three-dimensional data. The geometry of all crystallographic planes anddirections is accordingly reduced by one dimension. Planes are plotted as great circlelines, and directions are plotted as points. Also, the normal to a plane completelydescribes the orientation of a plane.
As our ﬁrst example, consider several of the more important planes of a cubic lattice:
speciﬁcally the (100), (110), and (111) planes. All three planes are treated in the three partsof Fig. 1.20. Notice that the stereographic projection of each plane can be represented eitherby a great circle or by a point showing the direction in space that is normal to the plane.
Many crystallographic problems can be solved by considering the stereographic pro-
jections of planes and directions in a single hemisphere, that is, normally the one in frontof the plane of the paper. The three examples given in Fig. 1.20 have all been plotted inthis manner. If the need arises, the stereographic projections in the rear hemisphere canalso be plotted in the same diagram. However, it is necessary that the projections inthe two hemispheres be distinguishable from each other. This may be accomplished ifthe stereographic projections of planes and directions in the forward hemisphere aredrawn as solid lines and dots, respectively, while those in the rear hemisphere are plottedTable 1.1 Crystal Structure of Some of the More Important Metallic Elements

lattice is used in this example.
1.14 DIRECTIONS THAT LIE IN A PLANE
Frequently one desires to show the positions of certain important crystallographic directions
that lie in a particular plane of a crystal. Thus, in a body-centered cubic crystal one of the
more important planes is {110}, and in each of these planes one ﬁnds two close-packed
/H20855111 /H20856directions. The two that lie in the (101) plane are shown in Fig. 1.22, where they
appear as dots lying on the great circle representing the (101) plane.01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 16
17 1.16 The Wulff Net
1.15 PLANES OF A ZONE
Those planes that mutually intersect along a common direction form the planes of a zone,
and the line of intersection is called the zone axis . In this regard, consider the [111] direc-
tion as a zone axis. Figure 1.23 shows that there are three {110} planes that pass through
the [111] direction. There are also three {112} planes and six {123} planes, as well as a
number of higher indice planes that have the same zone axis. The pertinent {112} and
{123} planes are shown in Fig. 1.24, whereas the stereographic projection of these and
the previously mentioned {110} planes are shown in Fig. 1.25. Notice that in this latter
ﬁgure only the poles of the planes are plotted, and it is signiﬁcant that all of the poles fall
on the great circle representing the stereographic projection of the (111) plane.
1.16 THE WULFF NET
The Wulff net is a stereographic projection of latitude and longitude lines in which
the north–south axis is parallel to the plane of the paper. The latitude and longitude lines
of the Wulff net serve the same function as the corresponding lines on a geographical
map or projection; that is, they make possible graphical measurements. However, in the
stereographic projection we are primarily interested in measuring angles, whereas in the
geographical sense distance is usually more important. A typical Wulff, or meridional, net
drawn to 2° intervals is shown in Fig. 1.26.[100] Direction(120)

(C)Stereographic projection of the (111) plane and its pole before and

including the basic circle, are great circles. Second, the equator is a great circle. All other
latitude lines are small circles. Third, angular distances between points representing direc-
tions in space can be measured on the Wulff net only if the points are made to coincide
with a great circle of the net.
In the handling of many crystallographic problems, it is frequently necessary to rotate
a stereographic projection corresponding to a given crystal orientation into a different ori-
entation. This is done for a number of reasons. One of the most important is to bring
experimentally measured data into a standard projection where the basic circle is a simple
close-packed plane such as (100) or (111). Deformation markings, or other experimentally
observed crystallographic phenomena, usually can be more readily interpreted when stud-
ied in terms of standard projections.
In solving problems with the aid of the Wulff net, it is customary to cover it with a piece
of tracing paper. A common pin is then driven through the paper and into the exact center
of the net. The paper, thus mounted, serves as a work sheet on which crystallographic data
are plotted. The following two types of rotation of the plotted data are possible.
Rotation About an Axis in the Line of Sight This rotation is eas-
ily performed by merely rotating the tracing paper, relative to the net, about the pin.
As an example, let us rotate a cubic lattice 45° clockwise around the [100] direction as
an axis. This rotation has the effect of placing the pole of the (111) plane, as plotted in
Fig. 1.20C, on the equator of the Wulff net. Figure 1.27A shows the effect of the desired01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 20
21 1.17 Standard Projections
rotation on the orientation of the cubic unit cell when the cell is viewed along the
[100] direction. Note that because the basic circle represents the (100) plane, a simple
rotation of the paper by 45° about the pin produces the desired rotation in the stereo-
graphic projection.
Rotation about the North–South Axis of the Wulff Net
This rotation is not as simple to perform as that given previously, which can be
accomplished by merely rotating the work sheet about the pin. Rotations of this
second type are accomplished by a graphical method. The data are first plotted stere-
ographically and then rotated along latitude lines and replotted in such a manner
that each point undergoes the same change in longitude. The method will be quite
evident if one considers the drawings of Fig. 1.28. In the present example, it is
assumed that the forward face (100) of the unit cell is rotated to the left about the
[001] direction as an axis. Consider now the effect of this rotation on the spatial
orientation and stereographic projection of the (1 0) plane. In Fig. 1.28A, the right-
and left-hand drawings represent the cubic unit cell before and after the rotation
respectively. The effect of the rotation on the stereographic projection of the (1 0)
plane is shown in Fig. 1.28B. Each of the curved arrows shown in this drawing
represents a change in longitude of 90°. In these drawings, the pole of the (1 0)
plane is not shown in order to simplify the presentation. The rotation that the (110)
pole undergoes is shown, however, in Fig. 1.29.
By using simple examples, the two basic rotations that can be made when the
Wulff net is used have been pointed out here. All possible rotations of a crystal in three
dimensions can be duplicated by using these rotations on a stereographic projection.
1.17 STANDARD PROJECTIONS
A stereographic projection, in which a prominent crystallographic direction or pole of an
important plane lies at the center of the projection, is known as a standard stereographic
projection. Such a projection for a cubic crystal is shown in Fig. 1.30, where the (100) pole111[001]

100 projection of a cubic crystal. In this diagram, note that the poles of all the {100},
{110}, and {111} planes have been plotted at their proper orientations. Each of these basic
crystallographic directions is represented by a characteristic symbol. For the {100} poles, this
is a square, signifying that these poles correspond to four-fold symmetry axes. If the crystal
is rotated 90° about any one of these directions, it will be returned to an orientation exactly

equivalent to its original orientation. In a 360° rotation about a {100} pole, the crystal
reproduces its original orientation four times. In the same fashion, a /H20855111 /H20856direction
corresponds to a three-fold symmetry axis, and these directions are indicated in the
stereographic projection by triangles. Finally, the two-fold symmetry of the /H20855110 /H20856directions
is indicated by the use of small ellipses to designate their positions in the stereographic
projection.
A more complete 100 standard projection of a cubic crystal is shown in Fig. 1.31. This
includes the poles of other planes of somewhat higher Miller indices. Figure 1.31 can
be considered to be either a projection showing the directions in a cubic crystal or
the poles of its planes. This is because in a cubic crystal, a plane is always normal to the
direction with the same Miller indices. In a hexagonal close-packed crystal, however,
the projection showing the poles of the planes is not the same as one showing crystallo-
graphic directions.
Figure 1.32 shows a 111 standard projection that contains the same poles as the

FIG. 1.32 A 111 standard projection of a cubic crystal
1.18 THE STANDARD STEREOGRAPHIC TRIANGLE FOR
CUBIC CRYSTALS
The great circles corresponding to the {100} and {110} planes of a cubic crystal are also
shown in the standard projections of Figs. 1.31 and 1.32. These great circles pass
through all of the poles shown on the diagram except those of the {123} planes. At
the same time, they divide the standard projection into 24 spherical triangles. These
spherical triangles all lie in the forward hemisphere of the projection. There are,
of course, 24 similar triangles in the rear hemisphere. An examination of the triangles
outlined in Figs. 1.31 and 1.32 shows an interesting fact: in every case, the three cor-
ners of the triangles are formed by a /H20855111 /H20856direction, a /H20855110 /H20856direction, and a /H20855100 /H20856direc-
tion. This is a highly signiﬁcant observation, since it means that each triangle
corresponds to a region of the crystal that is equivalent. In effect, this signiﬁes
that the three lattice directions, marked a1, a2, and a3, and shown in Fig. 1.33, are crys-
tallographically equivalent, because they are located at the same relative positions inside
three stereographic triangles. To illustrate this point, let us assume that it is possible to
cut three tensile specimens, with axes parallel to a1, a2, and a3, out of a very large sin-
gle crystal. If tensile tests were to be performed on these three smaller crystals now, one
would expect to get identical stress-strain curves for the three specimens. A similar01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 24

result should be obtained if some other physical property, such as the electrical resistiv-
ity, were to be measured along these three directions. The plotting of crystallographic
data is often simpliﬁed because of the equivalence of the stereographic triangles. For
example, if one has a large number of long, cylindrical crystals and wishes to plot the
orientations of the individual crystal axes, this can be done conveniently in a single
stereographic triangle, as shown in Fig. 1.34.a1

Similarly, planar density is the fraction of a crystallographic
plane occupied by atoms. The fraction of the volume occu-
pied in a unit cell, on the other hand, is called the atomic
packing factor. The latter should not be confused with bulk
density, which represents weight per unit volume.

The following problems involve the plotting of stereo-graphic projections and require the use of the Wulff net,shown in Fig. 1.26, and a sheet of tracing paper. In eachcase, first place the tracing paper over the Wulff net andthen pass a pin through the tracing paper and the cen-ter of the net so that the tracing paper may be rotatedabout the center of the net. Next, trace the outline ofthe basic circle on the tracing paper and place a smallvertical mark at the top of this traced circle to serve asan index.
1.13 Place a piece of tracing paper over the Wulff net as
described above, and draw an index mark on the tracing
paper over the north pole of the Wulff net. Then draw onthe tracing paper the proper symbols that identify thethree /H20855100 /H20856cube poles, the six /H20855110 /H20856poles, and the four
/H20855111 /H20856octahedral poles as in Fig. 1.33. On the assumption
that the basic circle is the (010) plane and that the northpole is [100], mark on tracing paper the correct Millerindices of all of the /H20855100 /H20856, /H20855110 /H20856, and /H20855111 /H20856poles. Draw inthe great circles corresponding to the planes of the plot-ted poles (see Fig. 1.33). Finally, identify these planeswith their Miller Indices.
1.14 Place a piece of tracing paper over the Wulff net and
draw on it the index mark at the north pole of the net as
well as the basic circle. Mark on this tracing paper all ofthe poles shown in Fig. 1.30 in order to obtain a 100 stan-dard projection. Now rotate this standard projectionabout the north–south polar axis by 45° so that the (110)pole moves to the center of the stereographic projection.In this rotation all of the other poles should also bemoved through 45° along the small circles of the Wulffnet on which they lie. This type of rotation is facilitatedby placing a second sheet of tracing paper over the ﬁrstand by plotting the rotated data on this sheet. This exer-cise shows one of the basic rotations that can be madewith a stereographic projection. The other primary rota-tion involves a simple rotation of the tracing paperaround the pin passing through the centers of both thetracing paper and the Wulff net.01Ch01.qxd  11/6/08  3:23 PM  Page 28
Because crystals are symmetrical arrays of atoms containing rows and planes of high
atomic density, they are able to act as three-dimensional diffraction gratings. If light
rays are to be efﬁciently diffracted by a grating, then the spacing of the grating (distance
between ruled lines on a grating) must be approximately equal to the wavelength of
the light waves. In the case of visible light, gratings with line separations between 1000
to 2000 nm are used to diffract wavelengths in the range from 400 to 800 nm. In crys-
tals, however, the separation between equally spaced parallel rows of atoms or atomic
planes is much smaller and of the order of a few tenths of a nanometer. Fortunately,
low-voltage X-rays have wavelengths of the proper magnitudes to be diffracted by
crystals; that is, X-rays produced by tubes operated in the range between 20,000 and
50,000 volts, as contrasted to those used in medical applications, where voltages exceed
100,000 volts.
When X-rays of a given frequency strike an atom, they interact with its electrons,
causing them to vibrate with the frequency of the X-ray beam. Since the electrons become
vibrating electrical charges, they reradiate the X-rays with no change in frequency. These
reﬂected rays come off the atoms in any direction. In other words, the electrons of an atom
“scatter” the X-ray beam in all directions.
When atoms spaced at regular intervals are irradiated by a beam of X-rays, the
scattered radiation undergoes interference. In certain directions constructive interfer-
ence occurs; in other directions destructive interference occurs. For instance, if a sin-
gle atomic plane is struck by a parallel beam of X-rays, the beam undergoes
constructive interference when the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
Thus, in Fig. 2.1, the rays marked a1to a3represent a parallel beam of X-rays. A wave
front of this beam, where all rays are in phase, is shown by the line AA. The line BB
is drawn perpendicular to rays reflected by the atoms in a direction such that the angle
of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Since BBlies at the same distance from the
wave front AAwhen measured along any ray, all points on BBmust be in phase. It is,
therefore, a wave front, and the direction of the reflected rays is a direction of
constructive interference.

FIG. 2.2 The Bragg law2.1 THE BRAGG LAW
The preceding discussion does not depend on the frequency of the radiation. However,
when the X-rays are reﬂected, not from an array of atoms arranged in a solitary plane, but
from atoms on a number of equally spaced parallel planes, such as exist in crystals, then
constructive interference can occur only under highly restricted conditions. The law that
governs the latter case is known as Bragg’s law . Let us now derive an expression for this
important relationship. For this purpose, let us consider each plane of atoms in a crystal as
a semitransparent mirror; that is, each plane reﬂects a part of the X-ray beam and also per-
mits part of it to pass through. When X-rays strike a crystal, the beam is reﬂected not only
from the surface layer of atoms, but also from atoms underneath the surface to a consid-
erable depth. Figure 2.2 shows an X-ray beam that is being reﬂected simultaneously from
two parallel lattice planes. In an actual case, the beam would be reﬂected not from just two
lattice planes, but from a large number of parallel planes. The lattice spacing, or distance
between planes, is represented by the symbol din Fig. 2.2. The line oAiis drawn perpen-
dicular to the incident rays and is therefore a wave front. Points oand m, which lie on this
wave front, must be in phase. The line oAris drawn perpendicular to the reﬂected rays a1
and a2, and the condition for OArto be a wave front is that the reﬂected rays must be in
phase at points oand n. This condition can only be satisﬁed if the distance mpn equals a
multiple of a complete wavelength; that is, it must equal lor 2 lor 3 lor nl, where lis
the wavelength of X-rays and nis an arbitrary integer.
An examination of Fig. 2.2 shows that both the distances mpand pnequal dsin u. The
distance mpnis, accordingly, 2 dsin u. If this quantity is equated to nl, we have Bragg’s law:

l/H11005wavelength in nm
d/H11005interplanar distance in nm
u/H11005angle of incidence or reﬂection of X-ray beam
When this relationship is satisﬁed, the reﬂected rays a1and a2will be in phase and con-
structive interference will result. Furthermore, the angles at which constructive interfer-
ence occur when a narrow beam of X-rays strikes an undistorted crystal are very sharply
deﬁned, because the reﬂections originate on many thousands of parallel lattice planes.02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 30

11 80°Under this condition, even a very small deviation from the angle usatisfying the above
relationship causes destructive interference of the reﬂected rays. As a consequence, the
reﬂected beam leaves the crystal as a narrow pencil of rays capable of producing sharpimages of the source on a photographic plate.
Let us now consider a simple example of an application of the Bragg equation. The
{110} planes of a body-centered cubic crystal have a separation of 0.1181 nm. If these planesare irradiated with X-rays from a tube with a copper target, the strongest line of which, the
has a wavelength 0.1541 nm, ﬁrst-order ( n/H110051) reﬂection will occur at an angle of
A second-order reﬂection from these {110} planes is not possible with radiation of thiswavelength because the argument of the arc sin { nl/2d) is
a number greater than unity, and therefore the solution is impossible. On the other hand,a tungsten target in an X-ray tube gives a       line with a wavelength of 0.02090 nm.Eleven orders of reﬂections are now possible. The angle u, corresponding to several
of these reﬂections, is shown in Table 2.1, and Fig. 2.3 shows a schematic representationof the same reﬂections.
In considering the preceding example, it is important to notice that, although there
are eleven angles at which a beam of wavelength 0.02090 nm will be reﬂected with con-structive interference from the {110} planes, only a very slight deviation in the angle u
away from any of these eleven values causes destructive interference and cancellation ofthe reﬂected beam. Whether a beam of X-rays is reﬂected from a set of crystallographicplanes is thus a sensitive function of the angle of inclination of the X-ray beam to theplane, and a constructive reﬂection should not be expected to occur every time a mono-chromatic beam impinges on a crystal.
Suppose that a crystal is maintained in a ﬁxed orientation with respect to a beam of
X-rays and that this beam is not monochromatic but contains all wavelengths longer thana given minimum value l
0. This type of X-ray beam is called a white X-ray beam, since it
is analogous to white light, which contains all the wavelengths in the visible spectrum.Although the angle of the beam is ﬁxed with respect to any given set of planes in the crys-tal, and the angle uof Bragg’s law is therefore a constant, reﬂections from all planes can2(0.1541)

FIG. 2.3 Four of the eleven angles at which Bragg reﬂections occur using a
crystal with an interplanar spacing of 0.1181 nm and X-rays of wavelength
0.02090 nm ( WKa1)
now occur as a result of the fact that the X-ray beam is continuous. The point in question
can be illustrated with the aid of a simple cubic lattice.
Let the X-ray beam have a minimum wavelength of 0.05 nm, and let it make a 60°
angle with the surface of the crystal, which, in turn, is assumed to be parallel to a set of
{100} planes. In addition, let the {100} planes have a spacing of 0.1 nm. Substituting these
values in the Bragg equation gives
nl/H110052dsin u
or
nl/H110052(0.1) sin 60° /H110050.1732
Thus, the rays reﬂected from {100} planes will contain the wavelengths
0.1732 nm for ﬁrst-order reﬂection
0.0866 nm for second-order reﬂection
0.0546 nm for third-order reﬂection
All other wavelengths will suffer destructive interference.
In the preceding examples, the reﬂecting planes were assumed parallel to the crystal
surface. This is not a necessary requirement for reﬂection; it is quite possible to obtain
reﬂections from planes that make all angles with the surface. Thus, in Fig. 2.4, the inci-
dent beam is shown normal to the surface and a (001) plane, while making an angle u
with two {210} planes—(012) and (0 2). The reﬂections from these two planes are
shown schematically in Fig. 2.4. It may be concluded that when a beam of white X-rays
strikes a crystal, many reﬂected beams will emerge from the crystal, each reﬂected beam
corresponding to a reﬂection from a different crystallographic plane. Furthermore, in
contrast to the incident beam that is continuous in wavelength, each reﬂected beam will
contain only discrete wavelengths as prescribed by the Bragg equation.102Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 32

2.2 LAUE TECHNIQUES
The Laue X-ray diffraction methods make use of a crystal with an orientation that is ﬁxed
with respect to a beam of continuous X-rays, as described in the preceding section. There
are two basic Laue techniques: in one, the beams reﬂected back in directions close to that
of the incident X-ray beam are studied; in the other, the reﬂected beams that pass through
the crystal are studied. Clearly the latter method cannot be applied to crystals of apprecia-
ble thickness (1 mm or more) because of the loss in intensity of the X-rays by their absorp-
tion in the metal. The ﬁrst method is known as the back-reﬂection Laue technique ; the latter
as the transmission Laue technique .
The back-reﬂection Laue method is especially valuable for determing the orientation
of the lattice inside crystals when the crystals are large and therefore opaque to X-rays.
Many physical and mechanical properties vary with direction inside crystals. The study of
these anisotropic properties of crystals requires a knowledge of the lattice orientation in
the crystals.
Figure 2.5 shows the arrangement of a typical Laue back-reﬂection camera. X-rays
from the target of an X-ray tube are collimated into a narrow beam by a tube several inches
long with an internal diameter of about 1 mm. The narrow beam of X-rays impinges on the

crystal at the right of the ﬁgure, where it is diffracted into a number of reﬂected beams that
strike the cassette containing a photographic ﬁlm. The front of the cassette is covered with
a thin sheet of material, for example, black paper, opaque to visible light, but transparent
to the reﬂected X-ray beams. In this way, the positions of the reﬂected beams are recorded
on the photographic ﬁlm as an array of small dark spots. More modern X-ray instruments
use Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) cameras or ﬂat plate detectors in place of photographic
ﬁlms.
Figure 2.6A shows the back-reﬂection X-ray pattern of a magnesium crystal oriented
so that the incident X-ray beam was perpendicular to the basal plane of the crystal. Each
spot corresponds to a reﬂection from a single crystallographic plane, and the sixfold sym-
metry of the lattice, when viewed in a direction perpendicular to the basal plane, is quite
apparent. If the crystal is rotated in a direction away from the one that gives the pattern
of Fig. 2.6A, the pattern of spots changes (Fig. 2.6B); nevertheless it still deﬁnes the orien-
tation of the lattice in space. Therefore, the orientation of the crystal can be determined in
terms of a Laue photograph.
Transmission Laue patterns can be obtained with an experimental arrangement simi-
lar to that for back-reﬂection patterns, but the ﬁlm is placed on the opposite side of the
specimen from the X-ray tube. Specimens may have the shape of small rods or plates,
but must be small in their thickness perpendicular to the X-ray beam. While the back-
reﬂection technique reﬂects the X-ray beam from planes nearly perpendicular to the beam
itself, the transmission technique records the reﬂections from planes nearly parallel to the
beam, as can be seen in Fig. 2.7.
Laue transmission photographs, like back-reﬂection photographs, consist of arrays
of spots. However, the arrangements of the spots differ in the two methods: transmission pat-
terns usually have spots arranged on ellipses, back-reﬂection on hyperbolas. (See Fig. 2.6B.)
The Laue transmission technique, like the back-reﬂection technique, is also used to ﬁnd
the orientation of crystal lattices. Both methods can be used to study a phenomenon called
asterism . A crystal that has been bent, or otherwise distorted, will have curved lattice planes
that act in the manner of curved mirrors and form distorted or elongated spots instead of

in Fig. 2.8. In many cases, analysis of the asterism, or distortion, of the spots in Laue photo-
graphs leads to valuable information concerning the mechanisms of plastic deformation.
In the preceding examples (Laue methods), a crystal is maintained in a ﬁxed orien-
tation with respect to the X-ray beam. Reﬂections are obtained because the beam is
continuous; that is, the wavelength is the variable. Several important X-ray diffraction
techniques that use X-rays of a single frequency or wavelength will now be considered.
In these methods, since lis no longer a variable, it is necessary to vary the angle uin
order to obtain reﬂections.
2.3 THE ROTATING-CRYSTAL METHOD
In the rotating-crystal method, crystallographic planes are brought into reﬂecting positions
by rotating a crystal about one of its axes while simultaneously radiating it with a beam of
monochromatic X-rays. The reﬂections are usually recorded on a photographic ﬁlm that
surrounds the specimen. (See Fig. 2.9 for a schematic view of the method.)02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 35
Chapter 2 Characterization Techniques 36
2.4 THE DEBYE-SCHERRER OR POWDER METHOD
In this method care is taken to see that the specimen contains not one crystal, but more
than several hundred randomly oriented crystals. The specimen may be either a small
polycrystalline metal wire, or a ﬁnely ground powder of the metal contained in a
plastic, cellulose, or glass tube. In either case, the crystalline aggregate consists of
a cylinder about 0.5 mm in diameter with crystals approximately 0.1 mm in diameter
or smaller. In the Debye-Scherrer method, as in the rotating single-crystal method, the
angle uis the variable; the wavelength lremains constant. In the powder method, a
variation of uis obtained, not by rotating a single crystal about one of its axes, but
through the presence of many small crystals randomly oriented in space in the speci-
men. The principles involved in the Debye-Scherrer method can be explained with the
aid of an example.
For the sake of simplicity, let us assume a crystalline structure with the simple
cubic lattice shown in Fig. 2.10, and that the spacing between {100} planes equals
0.1 nm. It can easily be shown that the interplanar spacing for planes of the {110}
type equals that of {100} planes divided by the square root of two, and is, therefore,
0.0707 nm. (See Fig. 2.10.) The {110} spacing is, therefore, smaller than the {100}
spacing. In fact, all other planes in the simple cubic lattice have a smaller spacing
than that of the cube, or {100}, planes, as is shown by the following equation for the
spacing of crystallographic planes in a cubic lattice, where h, k, and lare the three
Miller indices of a plane in the crystal; dhklthe interplanar spacing of the plane; and
athe length of the unit-cell edge

In the simple cubic structure, the distance between cubic planes, d100, equals a. Therefore

and for ﬁrst-order reﬂections, where nequals one, we have

This equation tells us that planes with the largest spacing will reﬂect at the smallest angle u.
If now it is arbitrarily assumed that the wavelength of the X-ray beam is 0.04 nm, ﬁrst-order
reﬂections will occur from {100} planes (with the assumed 0.1 nm spacing) when
On the other hand, {110} planes with a spacing 0.0707 nm reﬂect when
All other planes with larger indices (that is, {111}, {234}, etc.) reﬂect at still larger angles.
Figure 2.11 shows how the Debye-Scherrer reﬂections are found. A parallel beam
of monochromatic X-rays coming from the left of the ﬁgure is shown striking the crys-
talline aggregate. Since the specimen contains hundreds of randomly oriented crystals
in the region illuminated by the incident X-ray beam, many of these will have {100}
planes at the correct Bragg angle of 11°30 /H11032. Each of these crystals will therefore reﬂect
a part of the incident radiation in a direction that makes an angle twice 11°30 /H11032with the
original beam. However, because the crystals are randomly oriented in space, note all
the reﬂections will not lie in the same direction. Instead, the reﬂections will form au/H11005sin/H110021 0.04

cone with an apex angle of 23°. This cone is symmetric about the line of the incident
beam. In the same manner, it can be shown that ﬁrst-order reﬂections from {110}
planes form a cone, the surface of which makes an angle of twice 16°28 /H11032, or 32°56 /H11032
with the original direction of the beam, and that the planes of still higher indices form
cones of reﬂected rays, making larger and larger angles with the original direction of
the beam.
The most commonly used powder cameras employ a long strip ﬁlm that forms a
circular cylinder surrounding the specimen, as shown in Fig. 2.12. A schematic view of a
Debye-Scherrer ﬁlm after exposure and development is shown in Fig. 2.13.
On a Debye-Scherrer film, the distance 2 Sbetween the two circular segments of
the {100} cone is related to the angular opening of the cone and therefore to the Bragg
angle ubetween the reflecting plane and the incident beam. Thus, the angle in radi-
ans between the surface of the cone and the X-ray beam equals S/R, where Ris the
radius of the circle formed by the film. However, this same angle also equals 2 u, and,

This last relationship is important because it is possible to measure the Bragg angle uwith
it. In the preceding example, the spacing between parallel lattice planes was assumed to be
known. This assumption was made in order to explain the principles of the Debye-Scherrer
method. In many cases, however, one may not know the interplanar spacings of a crystal,
and measurements of the Bragg angles can then be used to determine these quantities. The
powder method is, accordingly, a powerful tool for determining the crystal structure of a
metal. In complicated crystals, other methods may have to be used in conjunction with the
powder method in order to complete an identiﬁcation. In any case, the Debye-Scherrer
method is probably the most important of all methods used in the determination of crystal
structures. Another very important application of the powder method is based upon the fact
that each crystalline material has its own characteristic set of interplanar spacings. Thus,
while copper, silver, and gold all have the same crystal structure (face-centered cubic), the
unit cells of these three metals are different in size, and, as a result, the interplanar spacings
and Bragg angles are different in each case. Since each crystalline material has its own char-
acteristic Bragg angles, it is possible to identify unknown crystalline phases in metals with
the aid of their Bragg reﬂections. For this purpose, a card ﬁle system (X-ray Diffraction Data
Index) has been published listing for approximately a thousand elements and crystalline
compounds, not only the Bragg angle of each important Debye-Scherrer diffraction line,
but also its relative strength or intensity. The identiﬁcation of an unknown crystalline phase
in a metal can be made by matching powder pattern Bragg angles and reﬂected intensities
of the unknown substance with the proper card of the index. The method is analogous to
a ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation system and constitutes an important method of qualitative
chemical analysis.
2.5 THE X-RAY DIFFRACTOMETER
The X-ray diffractometer is a device that measures the intensity of the X-ray reﬂections
from a crystal with an electronic detector, such as a Geiger counter or ionization chamber,
instead of a photographic ﬁlm. Figure 2.14 shows the elementary parts of a diffractometer—
a crystalline specimen, a parallel beam of X-rays, and a detector. The apparatus is so
arranged that both the crystal and the intensity measuring device (Geiger counter) rotate.
The detector, however, always moves at twice the speed of the specimen, which keeps the
intensity recording device at the proper angle during the rotation of the crystal so that it
can pick up each Bragg reﬂection as it occurs. In modern instruments of this type, theu/H11005S

intensity measuring device is connected through a suitable ampliﬁcation system to a chart
recorder or a digital storage device. In this manner one obtains an accurate plot of intensity
against Bragg angles. A typical X-ray diffractometer plot is shown in Fig. 2.15. Crystal struc-
ture and phase identiﬁcation in multiphase materials is commonly performed by compari-
son of the stored diffraction pattern to databases containing powder diffraction ﬁles (PDFs)
of known standards.
The X-ray diffractometer is most commonly used with a powder specimen in the form
of a rectangular plate with dimensions about 25 mm long and 12.5 mm wide. The speci-
men may be a sample of a polycrystalline metal, and it should be noted that, in contrast to
the Debye-Scherrer method where the specimen is a ﬁne wire (approximately 0.5 mm
diameter), the diffractometer sample has a ﬁnite size, which makes the specimen much eas-
ier to prepare and is therefore advantageous. Because the X-ray diffractometer is capable of
measuring the intensities of Bragg reﬂections with great accuracy, both qualitative and
quantitative chemical analyses can be made by this method. For a multiphase mixture, the
technique will allow for determination of relative concentration of the constituent phases
as well as identiﬁcation of each phase. The details of the procedure can be found in stan-
dard texts dealing with X-rays.1–3
2.6 THE TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
Within the past two decades a very powerful technique has become available to metallur-
gists. It involves the use of the electron microscope to study the internal structure of thin
crystalline ﬁlms or foils. These foils, which can be removed from bulk samples, are nor-
mally only several hundred nm thick. The thickness is dictated by the voltage at which the
microscope is operated. The normal instrument is rated between 100 and 400 kV, and elec-
trons accelerated by this voltage can give an acceptable image if the foil is not made thicker
than the indicated value. Thinner foils, on the other hand, tend to be less useful in reveal-
ing the nature of the structure in the metal. Some instruments have been developed that
operate at much higher voltages (of the order of a million volts), and in them the foils can
be proportionally thicker. However, equipment costs are also much greater, and few of
these instruments are available.
A word should be said about the technique involved in preparing a foil specimen for
examination in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). This involves cutting a thin
slice of the metal that is to be examined. A great deal of care must be taken so that the
specimen is not deformed during its preparation. This is because plastic deformation can
introduce unwanted structural defects in the microstructure that are visible in the TEM
image. A convenient machine that is useful for preparing specimens with a minimum of
distortion is a spark cutter designed to cut thin slices of a metal. In this case, electricalBragg angle θIntensityFIG. 2.15 The X-ray diffractometer records on a

41 2.6 The Transmission Electron Microscope
discharges between a wire and the specimen are used to cut the metal by removing
small particles of metal from the surface of the specimen as the wire slices through the
specimen. This leaves a thin, highly distorted layer near the surfaces of the cut that is
later polished away by chemical or electrochemical means. A typical section obtained by
this type of spark machining may be about 200 mm thick. This is much too thick to be
transparent in the TEM. Therefore, it is necessary to thin the specimen to its ﬁnal desired
thickness of several hundred nm using a chemical, electrochemical, or ion miller tech-
nique. The details of the procedure may be found in standard texts dealing with elec-
tron microscopy.4,5The most recent technique for TEM sample preparation is by using
a focused ion beam (FIB) instrument.3A typical FIB utilizes a liguid metal source to
form a highly focused beam with high current density. When the ion beam strikes a
specimen, it causes physical sputtering and material removal. The main advantage of the
technique is that it allows for selective thinning at desired locations by cutting trenches
in the sample. However, the technique also has the disadvantage of causing ion implan-
tation and severe damage to the material.6
In the transmission electron microscope, the detail in the image is formed by the dif-
fraction of electrons from the crystallographic planes of the object being investigated. The
electron microscope is, in many respects, analogous to an optical microscope. The source
is an electron gun instead of a light ﬁlament. The lenses are magnetic, being composed
normally of a current-carrying coil surrounded by a soft iron case. The lenses are energized
by direct current. An excellent, easy-to-read description of the electron microscope is
given in Volume 9 of the Metals Handbook . 4For our present purposes we shall concentrate
on that part of the microscope containing the specimen and the objective lens. This region
is indicated schematically in Fig. 2.16. In this diagram, the electron beam is shown enter-
ing the specimen from above. This beam originated in the electron gun and has passed
through a set of condensing lenses before it reaches the specimen. On emerging from the
specimen, the beam passes through the rear element of the instrument’s objective lens.
Shortly beyond this lens element, the rays converge to form a spot at point ain plane I1.
This spot is equivalent to an image of the source. Somewhat beyond this point, the image

of the specimen is formed at plane I2. Similar double image effects are observable in sim-
ple optical instruments where it is possible to form images of the light source at one posi-
tion and images of a lantern slide or other object at other positions.
Because the image formation in the transmission electron microscope depends on the
diffraction of electrons, it is necessary to consider some elementary facts about this type ofdiffraction. As demonstrated in Chapter 3, electrons not only have many of the attributesof particles, but they also possess wavelike properties. It will also be shown that the wave-length of an electron is related to its velocity vby the relation
2.7
where lis the wavelength of the electron, mis its mass, and his Planck’s constant equal
to 6.626 /H1100310
/H1100234J/Hz. This expression shows that the wavelength of an electron varies
inversely as its velocity. The higher the velocity, the shorter its wavelength.
Now let us assume that an electron is accelerated by a potential of 100 kV. This will
give the electron a velocity of about 2 /H11003108m/s and, by the above equation, a wavelength
of about 4 /H1100310/H1100212m, or about 4 /H1100310/H110023nm. This is about two orders of magnitude
smaller than the average wavelength used in X-ray diffraction studies of metallic crystals.This causes a corresponding difference in the nature of the diffraction, as can be deducedby considering Bragg’s law. Suppose that we are concerned with ﬁrst-order diffraction,where n/H110051. Then, by Bragg’s law, Eq. 2.1, we have
l/H110052dsin u
If d, the spacing of the parallel planes from which the electrons are reﬂected, is assumed
to be about 0.2 nm, we have
u/H11015sin u/H110050.01
The angle of incidence or reﬂection of a diffracted beam is thus only of the order of10
/H110022radians, or about 30 /H11032. This means that when a beam of electrons is passed through
a thin layer of crystalline material, only those planes nearly parallel to the beam can beexpected to contribute to the resulting diffraction pattern.
Let us now consider how the image is formed in the electron microscope as the result
of diffraction. In this regard, consider Fig. 2.17. Here it is assumed that some of the elec-trons, in passing through the specimen, are diffracted by one of the sets of planes in thespecimen. In general, only part of the electrons will be diffracted, and the remainder willpass directly through the specimen without being diffracted. These latter electrons will forma spot at position aand an image of the specimen ( O/H11032
2/H11002O/H110321) at the plane I2, as indicated in
Fig. 2.16. On the other hand, the diffracted electrons will enter the objective lens at aslightly different angle and will converge to form a spot at point b. These rays that pass
through point bwill also form an image of the specimen at I
2that is superimposed over that
from the direct beam. In the above, it has been assumed that the crystal is so oriented thatthe electrons are reﬂected primarily from a single crystallographic plane. This should causethe formation of a single pronounced spot at point bas a result of the diffraction. It is also
possible to have simultaneous reﬂections from a number of planes. In this case, instead ofa single spot appearing in I
1at point b, a typical array of spots or a diffraction pattern will
form on plane I. A characteristic diffraction pattern will be described presently.l/H11005h

43 2.6 The Transmission Electron Microscope
The electron microscope is so constructed that either the image of the diffraction pat-
tern (formed at I1) or the image of the detail in the specimen (formed at I2) can be viewed
on the ﬂuorescent screen of the instrument. Alternatively, both of these images can be pho-
tographed on a plate or ﬁlm. This is possible because a projection lens system (not shown)
is located in the microscope below that part of the instrument shown in Fig. 2.16. This lens
system can be adjusted to project either the image of the diffraction pattern at plane I1, or
that of the specimen at plane I2, onto the ﬂuorescent screen or photographic emulsion.
In operating the instrument as a microscope, one has the choice of using either the
image formed by the direct beam or the image formed by diffraction from a particular set
of planes. The elimination of the beam causing either of these two types of images is made
possible by the insertion of an aperture diaphragm at plane I1that allows only one of the
corresponding beams to pass through it, as shown in Fig. 2.18. In this diagram, the dif-
fracted beam is shown intercepted by the diaphragm, while the direct beam is allowed to
pass through the aperture. When the specimen is viewed in this manner, a bright-ﬁeld
image is formed. Imperfections in the crystal will normally appear as dark areas in this
image. These imperfections could be small inclusions of different transparency from the
matrix crystal, and therefore visible in the image as a result of a loss in intensity of the beam
where it passes through the more opaque particles. Of more general interest, however, is
the case where the imperfections are faults in the crystal lattice itself. A very important
defect of this type, that will be of considerable concern to us in subsequent chapters, is a
dislocation. Without delving too deeply into the nature of dislocations at this time, it is nec-
essary to point out that dislocations involve distortions in the arrangement of the crystal
planes. Such local distortions will have effects on the diffraction of electrons, because the
angle of incidence between the electron beam and the lattice planes around the dislocation
are altered. In some cases this may cause an increase in the number of diffracted electrons,

and in others a decrease. Since the direct beam can be considered to be the difference
between the incident beam and the diffracted beam, a local change in the diffracting con-ditions in the specimen will be reﬂected by a corresponding alteration in the intensityrecorded in the specimen image. Dislocations are thus visible in the image because theyaffect the diffraction of electrons. In a bright-ﬁeld image, dislocations normally appear asdark lines. A typical bright-ﬁeld photograph is shown in Fig. 4.6 (see p. 86).
The alternate method of using the electron microscope is to place the aperture so that
a diffracted ray is allowed to pass, while the direct beam is cut off. The image of the spec-imen formed in this case is of the dark-ﬁeld type. Here, dislocations appear as white lineslying on a dark background.
An important feature of the transmission electron microscope is the stage that holds
the specimen. As indicated earlier, diffraction plays a very important role in making thedefects in the crystal structure visible in the image. In order that the specimen may becapable of being aligned so that a suitable crystallographic plane can be brought into areﬂecting condition, it is usually necessary for the specimen to be tilted with respect to theelectron beam. The stage of an electron microscope is normally constructed so that thespecimen may be rotated or tilted.
With regard to the diffraction patterns observable in the microscope, an interesting dif-
fraction pattern is obtained when the specimen is tilted in its stage so that an importantzone axis is placed parallel to the microscope axis. When this is done, a pattern is obtainedwhose spots correspond to the planes of the zone whose axis parallels the electron beam.By way of illustration, let us assume that the specimen is so oriented that a /H20855100/H20856direction
is parallel to the instrument axis. Figure 2.19 shows a stereographic projection in whichthe zone axis is located at the center of the projection. The poles of the planes belongingto this zone should therefore lie on the basic circle of the stereographic projection. In theﬁgure, only the planes of low indices are shown. The diffraction pattern corresponding tothis zone is shown in Fig. 2.20. The Miller indices of the planes responsible for each spotare indicated alongside the corresponding spots.
The most signiﬁcant feature of the diffraction pattern in Fig. 2.20 is that all spots cor-
respond to planes parallel to the electron beam. Furthermore, as may be seen in Fig. 2.20,spots are indexed at both 100 and 00. This implies that the electrons are reﬂected fromboth sides of the same planes. Obviously, the simple Bragg picture shown in Fig. 2.2,where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection, does not apply in this case. Thereasons for this are not easy to understand. However, several factors are undoubtedlyinvolved. Of some importance is the small value of the Bragg angle u, which is about
10
/H110022radians. Another is the fact that the transmission specimen is very thin, so that the
electron beam, in traversing the specimen, sees a lattice that is nearly two-dimensional.This tends to relax the diffraction conditions. Finally, the electron microscope, with thespecimen located inside a system of lenses, is not a simple diffracting device. For our pres-ent purposes, however, it is more important to note the nature of the diffraction patternthan the causes for it.
Attention is now called to the spacing of the spots in the diffraction pattern in Fig. 2.20.
In this ﬁgure, the distance from the spot corresponding to the direct beam to that of a reﬂec-tion from a {100} plane is indicated as 1
010, while the corresponding distance to a {110}
reﬂection is 1011. As can be deduced from the ﬁgure, 1011/H11005/H2085721010. Attention is now
called to Fig. 2.10, where it is shown that the spacing between the two respective planesvaries inversely as /H208572. This indicates that the spacing of the spots in the diffraction pattern
is inversely proportional to the interplanar spacing. This result, unlike the relationship102Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 44

Since the angle uis small, tan uis also approximately equal to uand we should expect the

interplanar spacing d.
It is clear from the above that with the electron microscope it is possible both to inves-
tigate the internal defect structure of a crystalline specimen using the instrument as a
microscope, and to determine a considerable degree of information about the crystallo-
graphic features of the specimen using it as a diffraction instrument. With regard to the
latter application, the diffraction patterns can yield information both about the nature of
the crystal structure and about the orientation of the crystals in a specimen. Furthermore,
the electron microscope has a diaphragm in its optical path that controls the size of the
area that is able to contribute to the diffraction pattern. As a result, it is possible to obtain
information about an area of the specimen that has a radius as small as 0.5 m. The diffrac-
tion patterns are therefore called selected area diffraction patterns .
Examine Fig. 2.20 again. Note that each of the points, except for that at the center of
the diffraction pattern, represents a speciﬁc set of crystal planes. Thus, the point at theu/H11005nl

upper-left-hand corner corresponds to the set of parallel planes represented by the Miller
indices (011). Furthermore, the vector, 1011, from the center of the ﬁgure to this point has
a direction normal to these (011) planes and a length that is proportional to the interpla-nar spacing of the (011) planes. In addition, in the preceding text, it was deduced that

that it follows that . This can also be veriﬁed with aid of Eq. 2.2. Actually, thediffraction pattern in Fig. 2.20 corresponds to a two-dimensional section taken throughwhat is known as a reciprocal lattice . As deﬁned in the ASM Handbook , “The reciprocal lat-
tice is a lattice of points, each representing a set of planes in the crystal lattice, such that avector from the origin of the reciprocal lattice to any point is normal to the crystal planesand has a length that is the reciprocal of the planar spacing.” Reciprocal lattice can also beviewed as the Fourier transform of the regular lattice. For more information about thereciprocal lattice, see the book by Barrett and Massalski.

2.7 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE ELECTRONS IN AN
ELECTRON BEAM AND A METALLIC SPECIMEN
In the discussion about the transmission electron microscope, it was pointed out thatelectrons might penetrate the foil specimen to form the direct beam or be diffractedby certain planes of the crystals through which they passed. These are only two ofthe possibilities that may occur when a high-speed electron strikes a crystal surface.The others are also important. First, it is necessary to mention that the interactionbetween an electron and the atoms in a specimen may occur either elastically orinelastically.
2.8 ELASTIC SCATTERING
In this case, the path or trajectory of the moving electron is changed, but its energy orvelocity is not altered signiﬁcantly. For example, the diffraction of electrons by the planesof a TEM foil specimen can be classiﬁed as a form of elastic scattering. Elastic scattering canalso occur more randomly due to collisions either between beam electrons and atomicnuclei of the specimen that are not completely screened by their bound electrons orbetween the beam electrons and tightly bound core electrons. These scattering events canalter the trajectories of the electrons through any angle up to and including 180°.However, the change in path direction is normally less than about 5° for a single collision.If the direction change is more than 90° and if the electron exits the specimen, it is said tohave been elastically backscattered .
2.9 INELASTIC SCATTERING
Inelastic scattering occurs when the moving electron loses some of its kinetic energy as aresult of an interaction with the specimen. This energy loss can occur in a number of dif-ferent ways. Often, several successive interactions may occur, with each resulting in a lossof a fraction of the electron’s original energy.
A large fraction of the incident electron energy is spent creating phonons or atomic lat-
tice vibrations; that is, in heating the specimens. The electrons in the beam can also lose asigniﬁcant fraction of their energy by creating oscillations in a metal’s electron gas. This isknown as plasmon excitation . Another possibility is the energy loss associated with creating1011/H11005a/v21001/H11005v2 101102Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 46
47 2.9 Inelastic Scattering
the bremsstrahlung or continuous X-ray radiation, which results from the deceleration of
the beam electrons in the coulombic ﬁeld of an atom.
There are, however, several other types of interactions between beam electrons and a
specimen that are very useful for the microstructural analysis of specimens. Thus, beam
electrons can cause loosely bound conduction band electrons to be ejected from a specimen’s
surface. These ejected electrons are known as secondary electrons , and they normally possess a
relatively low energy; that is, /H1102150 eV. If one plots the intensity of the secondary electrons as
a function of their kinetic energy, as shown schematically in Fig. 2.21A, it is usually found
that the intensity of the secondary electrons peaks between 3 and 5 eV. Additional details on
the energy distribution curve of secondary electrons can be found in Reference 8.
If the electrons in the incident beam are sufﬁciently energetic, they may also cause the
ejection of electrons from the inner shells of the atoms. This ionizes the atoms and leaves
them in an energetic state where electrons from outer shells are able to drop into the
vacancies in the inner shells. Each of these events is accompanied by an energy release
either in the form of (1) an emission of a characteristic X-ray photon or (2) the ejection of
an electron from an outer shell of the atom. The electrons in the second type of emission

are known as Auger electrons . Both types of emissions are associated with ﬁxed amounts of
energy, which are unique to the atomic elements from which they come and thus charac-
teristic of the chemical elements in a specimen. Consequently, it is possible to obtain use-ful information about the chemical nature of a specimen in an electron microscopespecimen by measuring either the characteristic X-ray wavelengths or the Auger electronenergies. This will be discussed in more detail later.
2.10 ELECTRON SPECTRUM
An example of an electron spectrum obtained using a pure metal, molybdenum (atomicnumber 47), bombarded by 100 keV electrons, is shown in Fig. 2.21B. This ﬁgure shows aplot in which the ordinate is proportional to the number ( f) of backscattered electrons per
unit energy interval, while the abscissa represents the energy ( E) of the respective backscat-
tered electrons normalized to the energy of the beam electrons ( E
0). The data for this plot
was obtained using a 45° angle of incidence for the incident beam and a detector for meas-uring the emitted electrons oriented normal to the surface. Note that the backscattered elec-tron ﬂux passes through a very small maximum, identiﬁed by the symbol I, at an energyclose to E
0, the energy of the electrons in the incident beam. A backscattered electron with
an energy E0corresponds to one that has been elastically backscattered. With increasing
atomic number of the specimen, this peak in the emitted electron ﬂux increases in height,becomes narrower, and moves closer to E
0. At lower energies, in the region marked II, the
ordinate represents the ﬂux of the backscattered electrons that have lost some of their inci-dent energy as a result of various inelastic processes in the solid. In region III, which is veryclose to the zero end of the energy spectrum, the measured ﬂux is almost entirely causedby secondary electrons, which are normally considered to have a maximum energy ofabout 50 eV. Note that the ﬂux of the secondary electron peaks between 3 and 5 eV.
2.11 THE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
It is useful to consider the scanning electron microscope (SEM) as an instrument thatgreatly extends the usefulness of the optical microscope for studying specimens thatrequire higher magniﬁcations and greater depths of ﬁeld than can be attained optically.Many SEM specimens are normally polished and etched in the same manner as would bedone for examination in an optical microscope. Thus, the lengthy and tedious proceduresrequired for the preparation of TEM foil specimens are not needed for SEM specimens. Thescanning electron microscope is capable of greatly extending the limited magniﬁcationrange of the optical microscope, which normally extends to only about 1500 /H11003, to over
50,000 /H11003. In addition, with the SEM it is possible to obtain useful images of specimens that
have a great deal of surface relief such as are found on deeply etched specimens or on frac-ture surfaces. The depth of ﬁeld of the SEM can be as great as 300 times that of the opti-cal microscope. This feature makes the SEM especially valuable for analyzing fractures.
On the other hand, at low magniﬁcations, that is, below 300 to 400 /H11003, the image
formed by the scanning electron microscope is normally inferior to that of an opticalmicroscope. Thus, the optical and scanning microscopes can be viewed as complementingeach other. The optical microscope is the superior instrument at low magniﬁcations withrelatively ﬂat surfaces and the scanning microscope is superior at higher magniﬁcationsand with surfaces having strong relief.02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 48
49 2.11 The Scanning Electron Microscope
The scanning electron microscope differs signiﬁcantly from the transmission electron
microscope in the way an image of the specimen is formed. First, the ﬁeld of view in the
TEM specimen is uniformly “illuminated” by the high-speed electrons of the incident
beam. After passing through the foil specimen, these electrons are focused by a magnetic
objective lens to form an image of the specimen that is analogous to an optical shadow pic-
ture of the structure in the foil. The contrast in this image is produced by the varying
degree to which the electrons are diffracted as they pass through the specimen. The image
is thus roughly similar to that formed by an optical slide projector. In the scanning elec-
tron microscope, on the other hand, the image is developed as in a television set. The spec-
imen surface is scanned by a pointed electron beam over an area known as the raster . The
interaction of this sharply pointed beam with the specimen surface causes several types of
energetic emissions, including backscattered electrons, secondary electrons, Auger elec-
trons (a special form of secondary electrons), continuous X-rays, and characteristic X-rays.
Most of these emissions can furnish useful information about the nature of the specimen
at the spot under the beam. In a standard scanning electron microscope, one normally uses
the secondary electrons to develop an image. The reason for this is that the secondary elec-
tron signal comes primarily from the area directly under the beam and thus furnishes an
image with a very high resolution or one in which the detail is better resolved. The sec-
ondary electron detector is shown to the right of the electron beam in the schematic draw-
ing of Fig. 2.22. The front of this detector contains a screen biased at /H11001200 V. Since most
of the secondary electrons have energies only of the order of 3 to 5 eV, these low-energy
electrons tend to be easily drawn into the detector by its 200 V bias.
In the part of the specimen surface used to form the image, that is, the raster, the elec-
tron beam is swept along a straight line over the entire width of the raster, as indicated
in Fig. 2.23. As the beam moves across the line, the strength of the secondary electron

emission from the surface is measured by the detector and is used to control the brightness
of the synchronized spot on the cathode ray tube used to view or record the image. When
the electron beam completes its line scan at the far end of the raster, it is returned quickly
to the other side of the raster and to a point just below the start of the ﬁrst line. During the
time of its return, the beam of the cathode ray tube is turned off. By repeating this line scan-
ning process, the entire surface of the raster can be surveyed. The typical SEM uses 1000
line scans to form a 10 /H1100310 cm image. A CRT screen with a long persistence phosphor is
used so that the image will last long enough for the eye to be able to see a complete picture
without problems of fading. The complete scanning process is repeated every thirtieth of a
second, which conforms well to the one-twenty-fourth of a second frame time of a motion
picture. To obtain a permanent photographic record of the image, on the other hand, a
cathode ray tube with a short persistence phosphor is used. This avoids overlapping of
images from adjacent lines.
2.12 TOPOGRAPHIC CONTRAST
The means by which the SEM is able to interpret the topographic features of a metal sur-
face will now be discussed very brieﬂy. In Fig. 2.24, it is assumed that secondary
electrons are being used to study the surface of a fractured metal specimen and that the
incident beam of high-speed electrons (20 KeV) comes vertically from above. The ener-
getic electrons in this beam cause the emission of low-energy secondary electrons from
the specimen surface. Because of the 200 V positive bias on the detector, the secondary
electrons are attracted to the detector, which lies to the right of the incident beam.
The number of these electrons that reach the detector depends on several factors, one
of which is the relative inclination of the surface with respect to the location of the02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 50
51 2.12 Topographic Contrast
detector. Thus, in general, for two different surfaces—for example, one inclined down-
wards to the right as in Fig. 2.24A and the other downwards to the left as in Fig. 2.24B—
more secondary electrons will reach the detector from the former surface than from the
latter as the incident beam moves across each of these facets in turn. The result is that
on the CRT screen, surface A will appear brighter than surface B. Figure 2.25 shows an
example of the ability of the SEM to yield images with good contrast and excellent depth
of focus. This photomicrograph shows the fracture surface of a Copper–4.9 at. % Tin
specimen. This speciﬁc specimen was fractured under conditions that produced a failure
largely along the grain boundaries, although there are a number of grains that failed
transgranularly.
Backscattered electrons may also be used as a source of the signal sent from the spec-
imen surface to the CRT screen. This is considered in Fig. 2.26, where the detector screen
is assumed to be biased negatively ( /H1100250 V). The negative bias is sufﬁcient so that second-
ary electrons are not able to reach the detector, but not nearly high enough to reject the
energetic (16 to 18 keV) backscattered electrons. The backscattered electrons tend to travel
in straight lines so that only those lying on a “line of sight” between the point at which
the incident beam strikes the specimen and the front of the detector are effectively col-
lected by the detector. The detector in this case is more sensitive to its orientation with
respect to the surface than the detector used for secondary electrons. This means that by
using backscattered electrons, it is possible to attain an increased topographic contrast over
what would be achieved using secondary electrons. To illustrate, consider Fig. 2.26. Note
that the detector is aligned to receive some backscattered electrons from surface A, while
for surface B the alignment is much poorer. On the CRT screen, surface B should be very
dark in comparison to surface A. The resulting contrast may actually be too great, so a
detector capable of collecting both backscattered and secondary electrons may be a good
compromise.
Another important feature of the backscattering is that the scattering coefﬁcient, h,
increases with increasing atomic number, as5Beam Beam

used to image the atomic number difference between various regions of a specimen. Note
that when the target is a homogeneous mixture of several elements, the coefﬁcient hwill
depend on the weight fractions of the components.
A comparison between images produced by the secondary and backscattered
electrons is shown in parts A and B of Fig. 2.27. The sample, with an overall compo-
sition Nb–20 at. % Si, contained three phases: Nb5Si3, Nb3Si, and an Nb-rich solid
solution. The first phase, which has a lower atomic number than the other two,
appears as dark islands in the backscattered image, Fig. 2.27B. In contrast, the Nb solid
solution appears white and the Nb3Si solution appears gray. As will be discussed in
Chapter 14 on the solidification of metals, the first phase to solidify is Nb5Si, followed
by the (peritectic) phase Nb3Si, and then by an (eutectic) mixture of Nb3Si and the
Nb-rich solid solution. Note the terms peritectic and eutectic are defined in Chapter 11,
on binary phase diagrams.
2.13 THE PICTURE ELEMENT SIZE
The size of the picture element, also known as the picture point , is an important parameter
for understanding the SEM. It is the area of the raster surface that supplies the informa-
tion to a single spot on the CRT screen. For convenience, it will be considered that a line
scan occurs digitally; that is, the beam advances in equally spaced steps as it scans along a
line. Some scanning microscopes actually do this. Thus, if there are 1000 line scans on a
10/H1100310 cm CRT screen, there normally would be 1000 steps along a 10 cm line. Each spot
should then have a diameter of 100 mm. Dividing this diameter by the magniﬁcation of

electrons and (B)backscattered electrons02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 53
Chapter 2 Characterization Techniques 54
the instrument, M, gives the picture element size ( PES), which is also equivalent to the
distance that the beam moves along the raster in a single step.
PES/H11005100 mm/M 2.11
The ratio of the picture element size to the area under the beam supplying infor-
mation to a spot on the CRT screen is important. The latter area is normally larger
than the beam area at the surface, because of scattering of the incident beam electronsafter they penetrate the surface. It should also be pointed out that at the surface, theelectron beam covers a finite dimension; it is not a point of zero diameter. Usingextreme care and special equipment, such as a scanning microscope in which the spec-imen is placed within the objective lens, a probe diameter of the order of 2 nm maybe obtained. However, in the conventional SEM the smallest beam diameter is about5 nm, but the instrument is more often used with a beam diameter of 10 nm. For thesake of the present argument it will be assumed that the effective area supplying infor-mation has a diameter of 12.5 nm. If this area is smaller than the picture element, theimage of the specimen surface on the CRT screen should be in sharp focus. Withthe aid of Eq. 2.11 it can be deduced that a magnification of 8000 /H11003will yield a pic-
ture element with a 12.5 nm diameter. All magnifications greater than 8000 /H11003will of
course produce a picture element smaller than the area supplying information to thespot on the CRT screen. Thus, there will be an overlapping of the information sent tothe spots on the screen. In brief, for magnifications greater than 8000 /H11003, the images
will not contain more information than there is in the 8000 /H11003image. On the other
hand, all magnifications less than 8000 /H11003should yield images in sharp focus.
2.14 THE DEPTH OF FOCUS
The very large depth of focus characteristic of the SEM can be easily understood with theaid of the picture element size concept. The incident electron beam, which scans the spec-imen surface, normally has a very small angle of divergence. This angle may be estimatedusing Fig. 2.28. In this sketch, the distance between the ﬁnal aperture and the plane ofoptimum focus is designated by WD, which signiﬁes the working distance of the micro-
scope. If the radius, R, of the circular opening of the aperture is divided by the working
distance WD, the beam divergence, a, which is the incident beam semicone angle, is
obtained. Thus, a/H11005R/WD . In a typical case, Rcould be 100 mm and WD10 mm, making
aequal 0.01 rad.
Scanning electron microscope images with a very large depth of ﬁeld are obtained
when the area supplying information, which we will assume equals the beam size, is sig-niﬁcantly smaller than the picture element size at the working distance, WD, of the micro-
scope. Thus, because, in general, the divergence of the beam is small, there is a regionbelow and a region above the plane of optimum focus in which the beam size is smallerthan the picture element size. Objects will be in sharp focus within this space. This is illus-trated in Fig. 2.29, where two parallel vertical lines are drawn on a view of the beam cross-section to represent the PESdiameter. In this ﬁgure the depth of focus equals the vertical
distance, D, or the total distance above and below the plane of optimum focus within
which the beam diameter is smaller than the diameter of the picture element. Above andbelow the region deﬁned by D, the beam diameter is larger than the diameter of the pic-
ture element and the focus is no longer sharp.02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 54

2.15 MICROANALYSIS OF SPECIMENS
The scanning electron microscope can be easily converted into an instrument capable
of chemically microanalyzing specimens. Two important microanalyzing techniques will
now be considered. These are electron probe X-ray microanalysis and Auger electron
spectroscopy.
2.16 ELECTRON PROBE X-RAY MICROANALYSIS
The electron probe microanalyzer uses the characteristic peaks of the X-ray spectrum
resulting from the bombardment of the specimen by the beam electrons. The wavelengths
and strengths of these peaks can yield valuable information about the chemical composi-
tion of the specimen. An electron probe microanalyzer is thus basically an SEM equipped02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 55
Chapter 2 Characterization Techniques 56
with X-ray detectors. Two basic types of detectors are used. In the energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometer, a solid-state detector develops a histogram showing the relative frequency
of the X-ray photons as a function of their energy. The wavelength-dispersive spectro-
meter uses X-ray diffraction to separate the X-ray radiation into its component
wavelengths. Time does not permit further discussion of these devices; detailed descrip-
tions can be found in books on microanalysis.4
2.17 THE CHARACTERISTIC X-RAYS
The nature of the charactistic X-ray lines may be seen by examining the X-ray spectrum
of a typical metallic element such as molybdenum. Normally, the most important charac-
teristic lines of an element are the Kaand Kblines. If the surface of a molybdenum speci-
men is bombarded by electrons accelerated through a potential of 20,000 V, the X-rays
emitted form only the continuous spectrum, within the wavelength limits, of Fig. 2.30A,
where the X-ray intensity is plotted against the wavelength. Note the sharp cutoff at the
short wavelength side of the spectrum as well as the maximum in the X-ray intensity close
to the short wavelength limit. Increasing the applied potential to 25,000 V causes several
things to happen, as is shown in Fig. 2.30B. The short wavelength limit and the maximum
move to shorter wavelengths, the X-ray intensity increases at all wavelengths, and two
sharp peaks now appear superimposed on the continuous X-ray spectrum. These corre-
spond to the Kaand Kbcharacteristic X-ray lines. Finally, increasing the accelerating volt-
age applied to the electrons to 35,000 V, as in Fig. 2.30C, again increases the intensity at

all wavelengths, including those of the Kaand Kbpeaks, which now become much more
pronounced. Note that since the Kaand Kbwavelengths are ﬁxed, these lines now lie to
the right of the maximum in the continuous part of the spectrum instead of to the left of
it as in Fig. 2.30B.
The continuous part of the X-ray spectrum in Fig. 2.30 is a result of interactions
between incident beam electrons and atomic ions of the specimen in which electrons are
decelerated as they pass through the coulomb force ﬁelds of the ions. The energy losses
of the electrons in these inelastic collisions are converted into the energies of the X-ray
photons. Since these collisions can occur in a multitude of different ways, the result is the
continuous X-ray band or bremsstrahlung radiation. On the other hand, the characteris-
tic lines are formed by collisions between beam electrons and the atoms of the sample in
which inner shell electrons are ejected from their atoms. When one of these events
occurs, an electron from one of the atom’s outer shells falls almost instantly into the inner
shell hole, accompanied by the emission of a characteristic X-ray photon or an Auger
electron. In the present case, it is assumed that the emissions involve X-ray photons asso-
ciated with the Kaline. This line actually consists of two lines of only slightly different
wavelengths known as the Ka1and the Ka2lines. In Fig. 2.31A, the Kand Lshell ener-
gies of the molybdenum atom are plotted as horizontal lines. While the molybdenum
atom also contains electrons in the Mand Nshells, the energy levels of these shells are
not shown so as to simplify the presentation. In Fig. 2.31A, it is assumed that an inelas-
tic collision between an electron in the beam and a molybdenum atom has resulted in

the removal of an electron from the Klevel of the atom and then, as shown in Fig. 2.31B,
the hole in the Kshell is ﬁlled by an electron from the L3shell. This jump of the L3
electron produces an X-ray photon whose energy equals
2.12
where his Planck’s constant, vis the frequency of the X-ray photon, and EKand ELare the
ionization energies of the Kand L3levels. Substituting for vthe quotient l/c, where lis
the X-ray wavelength and cis the velocity of light, and rearranging Eq. 2.12 yields

where lis in nm and EKand       are expressed in keV. In molybdenum, EKis 19.9995 keV
and is 2.6251 keV so that /H110050.07093 nm. The       line, which conforms to electron
jumps between the L2and Kenergy levels, has a wavelength of 0.07136 nm. Since the
line is normally about twice as strong as the       line, a weighted average can be used
to estimate the wavelength of an unresolved Kaline. This gives /H110050.07107 nm. For the
purposes of making chemical analyses with the electron probe, it is normally not neces-
sary to resolve the Kaline into its two components; the wavelength (or energy) correspon-
ding to the Kadoublet is generally used. It is important to note that jumps from the L1
energy level to the Klevel do not occur.
An important consideration in the use of the electron probe X-ray microanalyzer
is that, while the electron beam striking the specimen surface may have a diameteras small as 10 nm, the area of the specimen surface from which the X-rays are emit-ted usually has a diameter of the order of 1 mm or 100 times larger than that of the
beam. Furthermore, the X-rays may also evolve from depths below the surface of
. In effect, this means that with the Electron Microprobe Analysis (EMPA) it
is possible to chemically map a metal specimen over dimensions of the order of mmwith a spatial resolution of about 1 mm and a detection limit of about 100 ppm. This
technique cannot be applied to analyze elements below Boron (atomic number 5)and is only suitable for qualitative analyses for elements between Boron and Neon(atomic number 10). However, quantitative measurements can be made for Na(atomic number 11) and elements with higher atomic numbers. The electron micro-probe is a useful instrument for the identification of the various phases in a metalspecimen, including the nonmetallic inclusions found in almost all commercialmetals. Another area where this instrument has proven valuable is in diffusionstudies where information about composition gradients is required. It can also beused to prove whether or not a metal alloy has a homogeneous composition.
2.18 AUGER* ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (AES)
In the previous section, it was assumed that after a beam electron knocks an electronout of an atom’s inner shell (the Kshell), an electron from an outer shell (an Lshell)
jumps into the inner shell hole with the simultaneous release of an X-ray photon. Analternative possibility is for the jump of the outer shell electron to be accompaniedby the ejection of a second outer shell electron (an Auger electron) as illustrated in/H112291 mm

Fig. 2.31C. Thus, when an electron from an outer shell drops into a hole in an inner
shell, one or the other of these two events occurs. The release of an Auger electronis preferred for elements with an atomic number less than 15 and for the study oflow-energy transitions ( /H9004E /H113512000 eV) in elements of higher atomic number. With
rising atomic number or /H9004E/H114072000 eV, the release of an X-ray photon becomes more
and more probable. Consequently, although the use of Auger electron spectroscopyis favored for elements of low atomic number, it is useful for all elements, eventhrough gold and higher atomic numbers.
When an Auger electron is ejected from an atom, it leaves with a ﬁxed amount of
kinetic energy. A large part of this energy can easily be lost if the Auger electron comesfrom an atom situated at any sizeable distance below the surface. However, if the atom liesvery close to the specimen surface (about 2–3 nm), the electron may be able to leave thesurface still possessing its characteristic energy. With a suitable detector, this energy maybe measured. The energy of the Auger electron that the detector sees may be computedwith the aid of the following equation:
Eke/H11005EK/H110022EL/H11002f 2.14
where Ekeis the kinetic energy of the Auger electron as seen by the detector, EKis
the ionization energy for a Klevel electron, ELis the ionization energy of the Lelec-
trons, and fis the work function of the detector (the work required for an electron
to penetrate an electrostatic or electromagnetic deflection analyzer). For example, ifan aluminum specimen is used where E
K/H110051559 eV, EL/H1100573 eV, and it is assumed
that f/H110055e V ,  Eke/H110051408 eV.
A signiﬁcant feature of the Auger reaction is that it involves three electrons: the elec-
tron knocked out of an inner shell, the outer-shell electron that jumps into the inner-shellhole, and the ejected outer-shell electron. It is common practice to describe a particularAuger reaction with a three-letter symbol identifying the three basic types of electronenergy levels involved in the transition. The present example would be represented by thenotation KLL.
One cannot perform an Auger analysis for an element having less than three electrons
because three electrons are needed for an Auger transition. This eliminates hydrogen andhelium from consideration. An Auger analysis is normally based on measurements of thestrengths of the Auger peaks in a plot of j, the backscattered electron energy per unit energy
interval, versus E, the energy of the electrons. This energy ﬂux is simply equal to the elec-
tron energy times the number of electrons per unit energy interval; that is, j/H11005E/H11003f. Such
a spectrum is depicted for a pure silver specimen bombarded by 1000 V electrons in thelower curve of Fig. 2.32. Note that it is very difﬁcult to resolve the Auger peaks on this curvebecause they are small and superimposed on a strong background signal due to backscat-tered electrons. If jis multiplied by 10 and the results replotted, the intermediate curve in
this ﬁgure is obtained. The Auger peaks are now more pronounced, but still difﬁcult toresolve. This problem can be solved by plotting the derivative of jwith respect of Eas in
the uppermost curve of Fig. 2.32. The resulting dj/dEcurve clearly shows evidence of sev-
eral peaks that fall within the range of energies between approximately 240 and 360 eV.These peaks are associated with MNN Auger transitions. The KLLand LMM peaks do not
appear because the 1,000 eV beam electrons are not energetic enough to remove electronsfrom the Kand Lshells of silver, where the ionization potentials are approximately 25,000
and 3500 V, respectively.02Ch02.qxd  11/6/08  3:24 PM  Page 59

In summary, Auger electron spectroscopy is useful for determining the compositions
of surface layers to a depth of about 2 nm for elements above He. It also has a spatial res-
olution /H11350100 nm, which is about a tenth of that of the electron probe X-ray microana-
lyzer. This makes this technique well suited to the studies of grain boundaries in metals
and alloys, especially with specimens susceptible to brittle grain boundary fractures. It is
also useful for surface segregation studies as in the solving of stress-corrosion problems.
2.19 THE SCANNING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON 
MICROSCOPE (STEM)
If the beam in the transmission microscope is focused to form a probe, as in the SEM,
and then scanned across the surface of a TEM thin foil specimen, it is possible to make
local, small-area analyses of the material in the foil. Alternatively, small-area diffraction
studies may be made. Accordingly, chemical analyses may be made of small particles or
inclusions observed in the specimen. This technique also makes use of the fact that the
volume from the signal that is sent to the detector is very small. In other words, the STEM
is an instrument with a very high resolution. This is because the foil specimen is normally
so thin that there is not much chance for the electrons to scatter out from the center of
the beam in the specimen. Thus, in the electron probe X-ray microanalyzer, the signal
comes from a bulbous volume roughly 1 mm deep by 1 mm in diameter. In the STEM, the
corresponding volume is roughly the thickness of the foil in depth and 2 to 3 nm in diam-
eter when the specimen is mounted in the lens, and 5–30 nm in diameter when it is
placed in the conventional position below the lens.

62Crystalline solids are empirically grouped into four classiﬁcations: ( a) ionic, ( b) van der
Waals, ( c) covalent, and ( d) metallic. This is not a rigid classiﬁcation, for many solids are of
an intermediate character and not capable of being placed in a speciﬁc class. Nevertheless,
this grouping is very convenient and greatly used in practice to indicate the general natureof the various solids.
3.1 THE INTERNAL ENERGY OF A CRYSTAL
The internal energy of a crystal is considered to be composed of two parts. First, there isthe lattice energy Uthat is deﬁned as the potential energy due to the electrostatic attrac-
tions and repulsions that atoms exert on one another. Second, there is the thermal energyof the crystal, associated with the vibrations of the atoms about their equilibrium latticepositions. It consists of the sum of all the individual vibrational energies (kinetic andpotential) of the atoms. In order to most conveniently study the nature of the bindingforces that hold crystals together (the lattice energy U), it is desirable to eliminate from
our considerations, as far as possible, complicating considerations of the thermal energy.This can be done most conveniently by assuming that all cohesive calculations refer tozero degrees absolute. Quantum theory tells us that at this temperature the atoms will bein their lowest vibrational energy states and that the zero-point energy associated withthese states is small. For the present, it will be assumed that the zero-point energy can beneglected and that all calculations refer to 0 K.
In setting up quantitative relationships to express the cohesion of solids, it is custom-
ary to work with cohesive energies rather than cohesive forces. The energy concept is pre-ferred because it is more conveniently compared with experimental data. Thus, the heatof sublimation and/or the heat of formation of a compound are both related to cohesiveenergies. In fact, the heat of sublimation at 0 K, which is the energy required to dissociatea mole of a substance into free atoms at absolute zero, is a particularly convenient meas-ure of the cohesive energy of a simple solid such as a metal.
3.2 IONIC CRYSTALS
The sodium chloride crystal serves as a good example of an ionic solid. Figure 3.1 showsthe lattice structure of this salt, which is simple cubic with alternating lattice positionsoccupied by positive and negative ions. This lattice can also be pictured as two interpene-trating face-centered cubic structures made up of positive and negative ions respectively.Figure 3.2 shows another form of ionic lattice, that of cesium chloride. Here each ion of agiven sign is surrounded by eight neighbors of the opposite sign. In the sodium chloridelattice, the corresponding coordination number is 6. An example in which this number is4 is shown in Fig. 3.3. In general, all three of the above structures are characteristic of two-atom ionic crystals in which the positive and negative ions both carry charges of the same

size. This is equivalent to saying that the atoms that make up the crystal have the same
valence. Ionic crystals can also be formed from atoms that have different valences, for
example, CaF2and TiO2. These, of course, form still different types of crystal lattices1that
will not be discussed.
Ideally, ionic crystals are formed by combining a highly electropositive metallic element
with a highly electronegative element such as one of the halogens, oxygen, or sulfur.
Certain of these solids have very interesting physical properties that are of considerable
importance to the metallurgist. In particular, the study of plastic deformation mechanisms
in ionic crystals, for example, LiF, AgCl, and MgO, has greatly added to our understanding
of similar processes in metals.
3.3 THE BORN THEORY OF IONIC CRYSTALS
The classical theory developed by Born and Madelung gives a simple and rather under-
standable picture of the nature of the cohesive forces in ionic crystals. It is ﬁrst assumed
that the ions are electrical charges with spherical symmetry and that they interact withCl–Na+

each other according to simple central-force laws. In ionic crystals, these interactions take
two basic forms, one long range and the other short range. The ﬁrst is the well-knownelectrostatic, or coulomb, force that varies inversely with the square of the distancebetween a pair of ions, or

where e
1and e2are the charges on the ions, r12is the center-to-center distance between
the ions, and kis a constant. If cgs units are used, k/H110051 dyne (cm2)/(statcoulombs)2, and
if mks units are employed, k/H110059/H11003109N m2/C2. The corresponding coulomb potential
energy for a pair of ions is
3.2
The other type of interaction is a short-range repulsion that occurs when ions are broughtso close together that their outer electron shells begin to overlap. When this happens, verylarge forces are brought into play that force the ions away from each other. In a typicalionic crystal, such as NaCl, both the positive and negative ions have ﬁlled electron shellscharacteristic of inert gases. Sodium, in giving up an electron, becomes a positive ion withthe electron conﬁguration of neon (1 s
2, 2s2, 2p6), while chlorine, in gaining an electron,
assumes that of argon (1 s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6). On a time-average basis, an atom with an
inert-gas arrangement of electrons may be considered as a positively charged nucleus sur-rounded by a spherical volume of negative charge (corresponding to the electrons). Insidethe outer limits of this negatively charged region all the available electronic energy statesare ﬁlled. It is not possible to introduce another electron into this volume without drasti-cally changing the energy of the atom. When two closed-shell ions are brought togetherso that their electron shells begin to overlap, the energy of the system (the two ions takentogether) rises very rapidly, or, as it might otherwise be stated, the atoms begin to repeleach other with large forces.
According to the Born theory, the total potential energy of a single ion in an ionic crys-
tal of the NaCl type, due to the presence of all the other ions, may be expressed in the form
f/H11005fM/H11001fR3.3
In this expression, fis the total potential energy of the ion, fMis its energy due to

of a single ion, the preceding equation becomes
3.5
where Nis Avogadro’s number (6.022 /H110031023) and Uis the total lattice potential energy.
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of this equation represents the electrostatic energy
due to simple coulomb forces between ions, whereas the second term is that due to the
repulsive interactions that arise when ions closely approach each other. It is a basic
assumption of the Born theory that the repulsive energy can be expressed as a simple
inverse power of the interionic distance. While quantum theory tells us that a repulsive
term of the type Be2/rnis not rigorously correct, it is still a reasonable approximation for
small variations of rfrom the equilibrium separation between atoms r0.
We shall presently consider in more detail the individual terms of the Born equation,
but before doing this let us look at the variation of the lattice energy with respect to the
interionic distance r. This can be done conveniently by plotting each of the two terms on
the right of the equation separately. The cohesive energy Uis then obtained as a function
of rby summing the curves of the individual terms. This is done in Fig. 3.5 for an assumed
value of 9 for the exponent n. Note that the repulsive term, because of the large value of
the exponent, determines the shape of the total energy curve at small distances, whereas
the coulomb energy, with its smaller dependence on r, is the controlling factor at large val-
ues of r. The important factor in this addition is that the cohesive energy shows a mini-
mum, U0, at the interionic distance r0, where r0is the equilibrium separation between ions
at 0K. If the separation between ions is either increased or decreased from r0, the total
energy of the crystal rises. Corresponding to this increase in energy is the development of
restoring forces acting to return the ions to their equilibrium separation r0.
Let us now consider the coulomb energy term of the Born equation, which for a sin-
gle ion is

assuming that we are speciﬁcally interested in a sodium chloride crystal where there is a
unit charge on each ion and z2/H110051. Because the coulomb energy varies inversely as the
ﬁrst power of the distance between charged ions, coulomb interactions act over large
distances, and it is not sufﬁcient to consider only the coulomb energy between a given ion
and its immediate neighbors. That this is true may be seen in the following. Around each
negative chlorine ion there are 6 positive sodium atoms at a distance of r. This may be con-
ﬁrmed by studying Fig. 3.4. There is an attractive energy between each of the six sodium
ions and the chlorine ions equal to /H11002e2/r, or in total /H110026e2/r. The next closest ions to a
given chlorine ion are 12 other negatively charged chlorine ions at a distance . The
interaction energy between these ions and the given ion is accordingly .
Following this there are 8 sodium ions at a distance of , 6 chlorine ions at , 24
sodium atoms at , etc. It is evident, therefore, that the coulomb energy of a single ion
equals a series of terms of the form

The constant Aof the coulomb energy, of course, equals the sum of the terms inside the
brackets in the preceding expression. This series, as expressed earlier, does not converge
because the terms do not decrease in size as the distance between ions is made larger.There are other mathematical methods of summing the ionic interactions
2,3and it is quite
possible to evaluate the constant A, which is called the Madelung number . For sodium chlo-
ride, the Madelung number is 1.7476 and the coulomb, or Madelung energy, for one ionin the crystal is, accordingly,

ration at 0 K; and K0, the compressibility of the solid at 0 K. At r0the net force on an ion
due to the other ions is zero, so that the ﬁrst derivative of the total potential energy withrespect to the distance, which equals the force on the ion, is also zero or
3.12
Since the quantity Ais already known, the preceding expression produces an equa-
tion relating nand B. A second equation is obtained from the fact that the compress-
ibility is a function of the second derivative of the cohesive energy ( d
2f/dr2)r/H11005r0at
r/H11005r0. In making these computations, the equilibrium separation of ions r0can be
experimentally obtained from X-ray diffraction measurements of the lattice constantextrapolated to 0K. In the NaCl crystal, this quantity equals 0.282 nm.
The compressibility is deﬁned by the expression
3.13
where K
0is the compressibility, Vis the volume of the crystal, and ( /H11128V//H11128p)Tis the rate of
change of the volume of the crystal with respect to pressure at constant temperature. Thecompressibility is thus the relative rate of change of volume with pressure at constant tem-perature, and is a quantity capable of experimental evaluation and extrapolation to 0 K.
When the calculations outlined above are made,
4it is found that the Born exponent
for the sodium chloride lattice is 8.0. In terms of this exponent, the computed cohesiveenergy is 180.4 K cal (7.56 /H1100310
5J) per mole. The latter is actually the energy of forma-
tion of a mole of solid NaCl from a mole of Na/H11001ions, in the vapor form, and a mole of
gaseous Cl/H11002ions. It is not possible experimentally to measure this quantity directly, but it
can be evaluated from measured values of the heat of formation of NaCl from metallicsodium and gaseous Cl
2in combination with measured values of the energy to sublime
sodium, the energy to ionize sodium, the energy to dissociate molecular chlorine to atomicchlorine, and the energy to ionize chlorine. When all of these values are considered,K0/H110051

the experimental value of Ufor the NaCl lattice turns out to be 188 K cal (7.88 /H11003105J)
per mole.
The rather good correspondence between the measured value of the cohesive energy
for NaCl and the value computed with the Born equation shows that the latter gives a
good ﬁrst approximation of the cohesive energy for a typical ionic solid.
3.4 VAN DER WAALS CRYSTALS
In the ﬁnal analysis, the cohesion of an ionic crystal is the result of its being composed of
ions: atoms carrying electrical charges. In forming the crystal, the atoms arrange them-
selves in such a way that the attractive energies between ions with unlike charges is
greater than all of the repulsive energies between ions with charges of the same signs. We
shall now consider another type of bonding that makes possible the formation of crystals
from atoms or even molecules that are electrically neutral and possess electron conﬁgura-
tions characteristic of inert gases. The forces that hold this type of solid together are usu-
ally quite small and of short range. They are called van der Waals forces and arise from
nonsymmetrical charge distributions. The most important component of these forces can
be ascribed to the interactions of electrical dipoles.
3.5 DIPOLES
An electrical dipole is formed by a pair of oppositely charged particles ( /H11001e1and /H11002e1) sep-
arated by a small distance. Let us call this distance a. Because the charges are not concen-
tric, they produce an electrostatic ﬁeld that is capable of exerting a force on other electrical
charges. Thus, in Fig. 3.6, let l1and l2be the respective distances from the two charges of
the dipole to a point in space at a distance rfrom the midpoint of the dipole. If ris large
compared to a, then the potential at the point p, using cgs units, is given by

would act on a charge of magnitude eif placed at point p, are accordingly

Also note that the electric ﬁeld intensity due to a dipole varies as the inverse cube of
the distance from the dipole, whereas the ﬁeld of a single charge varies as the inversesquare of the distance.
3.6 INERT CASES
Let us turn to a consideration of the inert-gas atoms such as neon or argon. The solidsformed by these elements serve as the prototype for the van der Waals crystals, just as crys-tals of the alkali halides (NaCl, etc.) are the prototype for ionic solids. It is interesting thatthey crystallize (at low temperatures) in the face-centered cubic system. In these atoms, asin all others, there is a positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons traveling inorbits. Because of their closed-shell structures, we can consider that over a period of timethe negative charges of the electrons are distributed about the nucleus with completespherical symmetry.

therefore coincides with the center of the positive charge on the nucleus, which means
that the inert gas atoms have no average dipole moment. They do, however, have an
instantaneous dipole moment because their electrons, in moving around the nuclei, do
not have centers of gravity that instantaneously coincide with the nuclei.
3.7 INDUCED DIPOLES
When an atom is placed in an external electrical ﬁeld, its electrons are, in general, dis-
placed from their normal positions relative to the nucleus. This charge redistribution may
be considered equivalent to the formation of a dipole inside the atom. Within limits, the
size of the induced dipole is proportional to the applied ﬁeld, so that we write
mI/H11005aE 3.21
where mIis the induced dipole moment, Eis the electrical ﬁeld intensity, and ais a con-
stant known as the polarizability .
When two inert-gas atoms are brought close together, the instantaneous dipole in
one atom (due to its electron movements) is able to induce a dipole in the other. This
mutual interaction between the atoms results in a net attractive force between the atoms.
Figure 3.7 represents two inert-gas atoms of the same kind (perhaps argon atoms) sepa-
rated by the distance r. Now let it be assumed that the atom on the left possesses an
instantaneous dipole moment mdue to the movement of the electrons around the
nucleus. This moment will produce a ﬁeld Eat the position of the second atom, which,
in turn, induces a dipole moment in the latter as given by Eq. 3.21. Ein this equation is
the ﬁeld at the right-hand atom due to the dipole moment in the left-hand atom.
First, consider the force exerted by the left dipole on the right dipole, which may be
evaluated as follows. Let us assume, as indicated in Fig. 3.7, that the induced dipole in the
right-hand atom is equivalent to the pair of charges /H11002e/H11032and /H11001e/H11032separated by the distance
a/H11032. According to this, the induced dipole moment is e/H11032a/H11032. Now let Ebe the ﬁeld intensity
due to the instantaneous dipole on the left atom at the negative charge ( /H11002e/H11032) of the
induced dipole. The corresponding ﬁeld at the position of the positive charge ( /H11001e/H11032) of the
induced dipole is E/H11001dE/dr/H11080a/H11032. The total force on the induced dipole due to the ﬁeld of
the other dipole is

but in general the ﬁeld of a dipole is proportional to the inverse cube of the distance, or
3.24
This leads us to the result
3.25
The energy of a pair of inert-gas atoms due to dipole interactions can now be evaluated as
follows:
3.26
It can be seen, therefore, that the van der Waals energy between a pair of inert-gas atomsdue to dipole interactions varies as the square of the dipole moment and the inverse sixthpower of their distance of separation; that the force varies as the square of the dipolemoment is signiﬁcant. Over a period of time the average dipole moment for an inert-gasatom must be zero. The square of this quantity does not equal zero, and it is on this basisthat inert-gas atoms can interact.
3.8 THE LATTICE ENERGY OF AN INERT-GAS SOLID
When the atoms of a rare-gas solid have their equilibrium separation, the van der Waalsattraction is countered by a repulsive force. The latter is of the same nature as that whichoccurs in ionic crystals and is due to the interaction that occurs when closed shells of elec-trons start to overlap. The cohesive energy of an inert-gas solid may therefore be expressedin the form
3.27
where A, B, and nare constants. It was shown,
5over 50 years ago, that if nequals 12, the
preceding equation correlates well with the observed properties of rare-gas solids. The ﬁrstterm on the right-hand side represents the total energy for one mole of the crystal causedby the dipole-dipole interactions between all the atoms of the solid. It may be obtained byﬁrst computing the energy of a single atom caused by its interactions with its neighbors.This quantity is then summed over all the atoms of the crystal. The computations arelengthy and will not be discussed. The second term in the preceding equation is the molarrepulsive energy.
As might be surmised from the second-order nature of the van der Waals interaction,
the cohesive energies of the inert-gas solids are quite small, being of the order of ofthose of the ionic crystals. The rare gases have also very low melting and boiling points,which is to be expected because of their small cohesive energies. Table 3.1 gives theseproperties for the inert-gas elements, with the exception of helium. Additional propertyvalues can be found in Reference 7.

3.9 THE DEBYE FREQUENCY
The zero-point energy of a crystal is its thermal energy when the atoms are vibrating
in their lowest energy states. When theoretical and experimental cohesive energiesare compared at an assumed temperature of 0 K, this energy, which has previouslybeen neglected, should be included along with other terms. In a crystaline solid thereare three vibrational degrees of freedom per atom. This means that an atom is freeto vibrate independently in three orthogonal directions. Thus, if one considers anatom to lie at the center of an orthogonal coordinate system, it should be able tovibrate parallel to the xaxis without inducing vibrations along the yor zaxes.
Similarly, it should be able to vibrate independently along either the yor zaxes. To
each of the three degrees a mode of vibration can be assigned so that there are threemodes per atom. A crystal of Natoms is considered as equivalent to 3 Noscillators of
various frequencies v.
The basic reasoning that brought Debye to these conclusions is as follows. First,
he assumed that the forces of interaction between a neighboring pair of atoms wereroughly equivalent to a linear spring. Pushing the atoms together would have theeffect of compressing the spring, and in so doing, a restoring force would be devel-oped that would act to return the atoms to their rest positions. Pulling the atomsapart would produce an equivalent opposite result. On this basis, Debye concludedthat the entire lattice might be considered to be a three-dimensional array of massesinterconnected by springs. In effect, assuming a simple cubic crystal, each atomwould be held in space by a set of three pairs of springs, as indicated in Fig. 3.8A. Henext considered how such an array right be able to vibrate. To simplify the presenta-tion, a one-dimensional crystal will be considered, as indicated in Fig. 3.8B, andfollowing Debye, the existence of longitudinal lattice vibrations will be ignoredbecause they are of less significance. The vibration modes of such an array are anal-ogous to the standing waves that can be set up in a string. In a simple string, thenumber of possible harmonics is theoretically infinite, and there is no lower limit forthe wavelengths that might be obtained. According to Debye, this is not true whena series of masses connected by springs are caused to vibrate. Here, as shown inFig. 3.9, the minimum wavelength or the mode of maximum frequency is obtainedwhen neighboring atoms vibrate against each other. As may be seen in the drawing,the minimum wavelength corresponds to twice the spacing between the atoms, orl
min/H110052a, where ais the interatomic spacing. The (maximum) vibrational frequency
associated with this wavelength is 03Ch03.qxd  11/11/08  7:52 PM  Page 72

0.25 nm, so that
3.29
The value, vm/H110051013Hz, is often used in simple calculations to represent the vibration
frequency of an atom in a crystal. Since these calculations ordinarily are accurate to only
about an order of magnitude (factor of 10), the use of the maximum vibration frequency
for the average vibration frequency does not cause serious problems.
3.10 THE ZERO-POINT ENERGY
In standing waves, the order of the harmonic corresponds to the number of half wave-
lengths in the standing wave pattern. Observe that in Fig. 3.9, where there are four
atoms, there are four half wavelengths, and this system of four atoms will be able to
vibrate in only four modes. In the case of a linear array of Nxatoms, there will be Nx
half wavelengths when the array vibrates at its maximum frequency. Since this lattervm/H110055/H11003103

Chapter 3 Crystal Binding 74
frequency corresponds to the Nxth harmonic, the system will have Nxtransverse
modes of vibration in the vertical plane, which is the assumed plane of vibration in
the drawing.
In a three-dimensional crystal of Natoms, each atom inside the crystal can undergo
transverse vibrations in three independent directions, as can be deduced by examining
Fig. 3.8A; and by reasoning similar to that above, it is possible to show that there are 3 N
independent transverse modes of vibrations.
In a linear crystal, such as that implied in Fig. 3.8B, the density of vibrational
modes is the same in any frequency interval dv. However, in a three-dimensional array
or crystal the vibrational modes are three-dimensional, and the multiplicity of the
standing wave patterns increases with increasing frequency. As a result, in the three-
dimensional case the number of modes possessing frequencies in the range vto v/H11001dv
is given by
3.30
where f(v)is a density function, Nis the number of atoms in the crystal, vis the vibrational
frequency of an oscillator, and vmis the maximum vibrational frequency.
Figure 3.10 is a schematic plot of the Debye density function f(v)as a function of v.
The area under this curve from v/H110050 to v/H11005vmequals 3 N, the total number of oscillators.
According to the quantum theory, the zero-point energy of a simple oscillator is hv/2. The
total vibrational energy of the crystal at absolute zero is, accordingly,
3.31
This quantity should normally be added to experimentally determined cohesive
energies (Table 3.1) in comparing them with computed static lattice energies. The cor-
rection due to the zero-point energy is about 31 percent or about 0.59 KJ per mol in
the case of neon,6so that the lattice energy U0should be about 2.47 KJ per mol rather
than 1.88 KJ per mol, as shown in Table 3.1. The importance of this correction
decreases as the atomic number of the rare-gas element rises, so that for Xe it amounts
to about 3 percent.Ez/H11005/H20885vm

3.11 DIPOLE-QUADRUPOLE AND QUADRUPOLE-QUADRUPOLE
TERMS
The van der Waals attractive energy is caused by a synchronization of the motion of the
electrons on the various atoms of a solid. As a ﬁrst approximation it might be consideredthat this interaction is equivalent to the development of synchronized dipoles on the atoms.The summation of the dipole interactions throughout the crystal then leads to an attractiveenergy that varies as the inverse sixth power of the distance. Actually, the complex chargedistributions that exist in real atoms cannot be accurately represented by picturing them assimple dipoles. Modern quantum mechanical treatments generally use an expression forthe van der Waals attractive energy (expressed in terms of a single ion) of the type
3.32
where c
1, c2, and c3are constants. The ﬁrst term of this expression is the dipole-dipole
interaction already considered. The second term in the inverse eighth power of the dis-tance is called the dipole-quadrupole term because the interaction between a dipole on
one atom and a quadrupole on another will lead to an energy that varies as the inverseeighth power of the distance. A quadrupole is a double dipole consisting of fourcharges. The last term, varying as the inverse tenth power of the distance, is called thequadrupole-quadrupole term . It is, in general, small and amounts to less than 1.3 percent
of the total van der Waals attractive energy for all of the inert-gas solids.
6,8The dipole-
quadrupole term, on the other hand, equals approximately 16 percent of the totalattractive energy, indicating that, whereas the dipole-dipole term makes up most of thevan der Waals attractive energy, the second term is also signiﬁcant.
3.12 MOLECULAR CRYSTALS
Many molecules form crystals which are held together by van der Waals forces. Amongthese are N
2, H2, and CH4; these are typical covalent molecules in which the atoms share
valence electrons to effectively obtain closed shells for each atom in the molecule.The forces of attraction between such molecules are very small and of the order of thosein the inert-gas crystals.
The molecules mentioned in the preceding paragraph are nonpolar molecules; they do
not have permanent dipole moments. Thus, the attractive force between two hydrogenmolecules comes in large measure from the synchronism of electron movements in thetwo molecules, or from instantaneous dipole-dipole interactions. In addition to these,there are also polar molecules, such as water (H
2O), which possess permanent dipoles. The
interaction between a pair of permanent dipoles is, in general, much stronger than thatbetween induced dipoles. This leads to much stronger binding (van der Waals binding) intheir respective crystals with correspondingly higher melting and boiling points.
3.13 REFINEMENTS TO THE BORN THEORY OF IONIC CRYSTALS
In the inert-gas and molecular solids considered in the preceding section, van der Waalsforces are the primary source of the cohesive energy. These forces exist in other solids, butwhen the binding due to other causes is strong they may contribute only a small fractionf(r)/H11005/H11002/H20898c1

of the total binding energy. This is generally true in ionic crystals, although some types, like
the silver halides, may have van der Waals contributions of more than 10 percent. The alkalihalides, as may be seen in Table 3.2, have van der Waals energies that amount to only asmall percentage of the total energy. This table is of particular interest because it lists thecontribution of ﬁve terms to the total lattice energy. The ﬁrst column gives the Madelungenergy, or the ﬁrst term in the simple Born equation. The second is the repulsive energy,caused by the overlapping of closed ion shells. The third and fourth columns are van derWaals terms: dipole-dipole and dipole-quadrupole. The ﬁfth column lists zero-point ener-gies: the energy of vibration of the atoms in their lowest energy levels. Finally, the lastcolumn is that corresponding to the sum of all ﬁve terms, which should equal the internalenergy of the crystals at zero degrees absolute and at zero pressure.
3.14 COVALENT AND METALLIC BONDING
In both the ionic and the inert-gas crystals that have been considered, the crystals areformed of atoms or ions with closed-shell conﬁgurations of electrons. In these solids,the electrons are considered to be tightly bound to their respective atoms inside thecrystal. Because of this fact, ionic and rare-gas solids are easier to interpret in terms ofthe laws of classical physics. It is only when greater accuracy is needed in computingthe physical properties of these crystals that one needs to turn to the more modernquantum mechanical interpretation. Quantum, or wave mechanics, is, however, anessential when it comes to studying the bonding in covalent or metallic crystals. In eachof the latter, the bonding is associated with the valence electrons that are not consid-ered to be permanently bound to speciﬁc atoms in the solids. In other words, in bothof these solids, the valence electrons are shared between atoms. In valence crystals, thesharing of electrons effects a closed-shell conﬁguration for each atom of the solid. Theprototype of this form of crystal is the diamond form of carbon. Each carbon atombrings four valence electrons into the crystal. The coordination number of the diamondstructure is also four, as shown in Fig. 3.11. If a given carbon atom shares one of itsfour valence electrons with each of its four neighbors, and the neighbors reciprocate inturn, the carbon atom will, as a result of this sharing of eight electrons, effectively03Ch03.qxd  11/11/08  7:52 PM  Page 76
77 3.14 Covalent and Metallic Bonding
FIG. 3.11 The diamond structure. Each carbon
atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbors.
Note: this structure is the same as that of
zincblende (ZnS), Fig. 3.3, except that this
lattice contains one kind of atom, instead of two
achieve the electron conﬁguration of neon (1 s2, 2s2, 2p6). In this type of crystal, it is
often convenient to think of the pairs of electrons which are shared between nearest
neighbors as constituting a chemical bond between a pair of atoms. On the other hand,
according to the band theory of solids, the electrons are not ﬁxed to speciﬁc bonds, but
can interchange between bonds. Thus, the valence electrons in a valence crystal can
also be thought of as belonging to the crystal as a whole.
The binding associated with these covalent, or homopolar , linkages as they are called,
is very strong so that the cohesive energy of a solid such as diamond is very large and, in
agreement with this fact, these solids are usually very hard and have high melting points.
The covalent bond is also responsible for the cohesion of many well-known mole-
cules, for example, the hydrogen molecule. An idea of how the binding energy develops
can be obtained by an elementary consideration of the hydrogen molecule. The lowest
atomic energy state is associated with the 1 sshell. Two electrons can be accommodated in
this state, but only if they have opposite spins. Thus an unexcited helium atom will have
both of its electrons in the 1 sstate but only if the spin vectors of the electrons are opposed.
The fact that two electrons can occupy the same quantum state only if the spins are oppo-
sitely directed is known as the Pauli exclusion principle . Now suppose that two hydrogen
atoms are made to approach each other. Then there are two cases to be considered: when
the spins of the electrons on the two atoms are parallel, and when the spins are opposed.
First consider the latter case. As the atoms come closer and closer together, the electron on
either atom begins to ﬁnd itself in the ﬁeld of the charge on the nucleus of the other atom.
Since the spins of the electrons are opposed, each nucleus is capable of containing both
electrons in the 1 sground state. Under these conditions, there is a strong probability that
the electrons will spend more time in the neighborhood of one nucleus than the other,
and the hydrogen molecule becomes a pair of charged ions—one positive and the other
negative. This structure is unstable, especially when the hydrogen atoms are far apart, as
may be estimated from the energy required to form a positive and a negative pair of hydro-
gen ions ( /H110021237 KJ per mol).8At the normal distance of separation of the atoms in a
hydrogen molecule, the ionic structure exists for limited periods of time and contributes
about 5 percent of the total binding energy.8
A much more important type of electron interchange occurs when both electrons
simultaneously exchange nuclei. The resulting shifting of the electrons back and forth
between the nuclei, which occurs at a very rapid rate, is commonly known as a resonance
effect, and about 80 percent8of the binding energy of the hydrogen molecule is attributed
to it. With the aid of quantum mechanics, the total binding energy of a hydrogen molecule03Ch03.qxd  11/11/08  7:52 PM  Page 77
Chapter 3 Crystal Binding 78
has been computed and, as a result, an insight into the nature of the binding energy asso-
ciated with this exchange of electrons has been obtained. Quantum mechanics shows that,on the average, the electrons spend more of their time in the region between the two pro-tons than they do on the far sides of the protons. From a very elementary point of view, wemay consider that the binding of the hydrogen molecule results from the attraction of thepositively charged hydrogen nuclei to the negative charge which exists between them.
Attention is called to the interrelation between space and time implied in this discus-
sion concerning the time-average position of the electrons. These ideas are normallyexpressed in terms of a phase space. This is a coordinate system that includes both the posi-tions of the particles and their momenta (that is, velocities). Thus, for a single particle freeto move along a single direction (the x-axis), there will be two dimensions in phase space:
its position along the axis, and its momentum. For nparticles capable of moving in a sin-
gle direction, there will be 2 nlinear dimensions in the phase space associated with these
particles. These are x
1, x2, . . . xn, the positions of the particles; and p1, p2, . . . pn, the
momenta of the particles. For particles capable of moving in three dimensions, there willbe 6ndegrees of freedom and therefore a corresponding number of dimensions in phase
space.
An important theorem in statistical mechanics that bears on the subject of phase space
states that the position and momentum average in phase space coincide with the sameaverage over an inﬁnite time. As an example of the application of this theorem, considerthe following. The energy of a set of particles is a function of their positions in space andtheir momenta (velocities). The average energy can be computed by averaging a ﬁnitenumber of position and velocity measurements. The greater the number of these sets ofreadings that are taken, the closer to the true average will be the result. On the other hand,the positions and velocities are also a function of time. Therefore their energy can also beconsidered as a function of time, and the average could be taken from a set of readingsmade over a very long period of time. This average should agree with that made inside avery short time interval.
In the above, it was assumed that the electrons of the two hydrogen atoms had oppo-
sitely directed spins. Now consider the case where two hydrogen atoms with parallel spinsare made to approach each other. Here, as the electron on either of the atoms comeswithin the range of effectiveness of the ﬁeld on the nucleus of the other atom, it is foundthat the energy level it would normally occupy is already ﬁlled. The situation is similar tothat when an electron is brought within the limits of the closed shell of an inert-gas con-ﬁguration. The normal electronic orbits become badly distorted, or else the second elec-tron moves into a higher energy state, such as 2 s
1. In either case, bringing together two
hydrogen atoms with electrons that have parallel spins increases the energy of the system.A stable molecule cannot be formed in this fashion. This is shown in Fig. 3.12, where theuppermost curve represents the hydrogen molecule with parallel spins and both electronsin 1sorbits. The lower curve is for opposed electron spins, and it can be observed that this
curve has a pronounced minimum, indicating that in this case a stable molecule can beformed. Notice that the curves of Fig. 3.12 represent the total energy of the hydrogenmolecule at corresponding values of r. In addition to the ionic and the exchange, or reso-
nance energy, there are other more complicated electrostatic interactions between the twoelectrons and the two protons. These contribute the remaining 15 percent of the bindingenergy of the hydrogen molecule.
Valence electrons are also shared between atoms in a typical metallic crystal. Here,
however, they are best considered as free electrons and not as electron pairs forming bonds03Ch03.qxd  11/11/08  7:52 PM  Page 78

between neighboring atoms. This difference between a metal and a covalent solid is prob-
ably a matter of degree, for it is known that the valence electrons in a covalent solid can
move from one bond to another and thus are able to move throughout the crystal. It can
be shown that the zone or band theory of solids is able to explain adequately the difference
between a covalent or homopolar crystal and a metallic one. However, for the present let
us assume that in a metal the valence electrons are able to move at will through the lattice,
while in a covalent crystal the electrons form directed bonds between neighboring atoms.
One result of this difference is that metals tend to crystallize in close-packed lattices (face-
centered cubic and close-packed hexagonal structures) in which the directionality of the
bonds between atoms is of secondary importance, while covalent crystals form complicated
structures so that the bonds between neighboring atoms will give each atom the effect of
having a closed-shell conﬁguration of electrons. Thus, carbon, with four valence electrons
per atom, crystallizes in the diamond lattice with four nearest neighbors, so that each car-
bon atom has a total of eight shared electrons. In the same manner, arsenic, antimony, and
bismuth, which have ﬁve valence electrons per atom, need to share electrons with three
neighbors in order to attain the eight electrons needed for a closed-shell conﬁguration. The
latter substances therefore crystallize with three nearest neighbors. In general, covalent
crystals follow what is known as the (8 – N) rule, where Nis the number of valence elec-
trons, and the factor (8 – N) gives the number of nearest neighbors in the structure.
On the assumption that inside a metal the valence electrons are free, we arrive at the
following elementary idea of a metal. A metal consists of an ordered array of positively
charged ions between which the valence electrons move in all directions with high veloci-
ties. Over a period of time, this movement of electrons is equivalent to a more or less uni-
form distribution of negative electricity which might be thought of as an electron gas that
holds the assembly together. In the absence of this gas, the positively charged nuclei would
repel each other and the assembly would disintegrate. On the other hand, the electron gas
itself could not exist without the presence of the array of positively charged nuclei. This is
because the electrons would also repel each other. The cooperative interaction between the
electron gas and the positively charged nuclei forms a structure that is stable. The binding
forces that hold a metallic crystal together can be assumed to come from the attraction of
the positively charged ions for the cloud of negative charge that lies between them. It is also
interesting to note that, as the distance between nuclei is made smaller (as the volume of
the metal is decreased), the velocities of the free electrons increase with a corresponding03Ch03.qxd  11/11/08  7:52 PM  Page 79
Chapter 3 Crystal Binding 80
rise in their kinetic energy. This leads to a repulsive energy term which becomes large when
a metal is compressed. The simplest metals to understand are such alkali metals as sodiumand potassium. In them there is only a single valence electron and the positive ions are wellseparated in the solid so that there is little overlapping of ion shells, and the repulsioncaused by the overlapping of shells is therefore small. In these metals, the repulsive energyis chieﬂy due to the electronic kinetic energy term. In other metallic elements, the theoriesof the cohesive energies are much more involved. They will not be discussed here.

824.1 THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE THEORETICAL AND
OBSERVED YIELD STRESSES OF CRYSTALS
The stress-strain curve of a typical magnesium single crystal, oriented with the basal
plane inclined at 45° to the stress axis and strained in tension, is shown in Fig. 4.1.
At the low tensile stress of 0.7 MPa, the crystal yields plastically and then easily
stretches out to a narrow ribbon which may be four or five times longer than the
original crystal. If one examines the surface of the deformed crystal, markings can be
seen which run more or less continuously around the specimen in the form of
ellipses. (See Fig. 4.2.) These markings, if viewed at very high magnifications, are
recognized as the visible manifestations of a series of fine steps that have formed on
the surface. The nature of these steps is shown schematically in Fig. 4.3. Evidently,
as a result of the applied force, the crystal has been sheared on a number of parallel
planes. Crystallographic analyses of the markings, furthermore, show that these are
basal (0002) planes and, therefore, the closest packed plane of the crystal. (Earlier in
Chapter 1 the basal plane was given the Miller indices (0001). The notation (0002)
is also used, primarily to call attention to the fact that the spacing between basal
planes equals one-half the height of the hcp unit cell.) When this type of deforma-
tion occurs, the crystal is said to have undergone “slip,” the visible markings on the
surface are called slip lines , or slip traces , and the crystallographic plane on which the
shear has occurred is called the slip plane .
The shear stress at which plastic flow begins in a single crystal is amazingly small
when compared to the theoretical shear strength of a perfect crystal (computed in

83 4.1 The Discrepancy Between the Theoretical and Observed Yield Stresses of Crystals
terms of cohesive forces between atoms). An estimate of this strength can be
obtained in the following manner. Figure 4.4A shows two adjacent planes of a hypo-
thetical crystal. A shearing stress, acting as indicated by the vectors marked τ, tends
to move the atoms of the upper plane to the left. Each atom of the upper plane rises
to a maximum position (Fig. 4.4B) as it slides over its neighbor in the plane below.
This maximum position represents a saddle point, for continued motion to the left
will now be promoted by the forces which pull the atom into the next well. A shear
of one atomic distance requires that the atoms of the upper plane in Fig. 4.4A be
brought to a position equivalent to that in Fig. 4.4B, after which they move on their
own accord into the next equilibrium position, Fig. 4.4C. To reach the saddle point,
a horizontal movement of each atom is required equal to an atomic radius. This
movement is shown in Fig. 4.4B. Since the separation of the two planes is of the
order of two atomic radii, the shear strain at the saddle point is approximately equal
to one half. That is,

where /H9253/H11005shear strain. In a perfectly elastic crystal, the ratio of shear stress to shear strain
is equal to the shear modulus:

where /H9253is shear strain, τis shear stress, and /H9262is shear modulus. Substituting the
value for /H9253the shear strain, and the value 17.2 GPa for /H9262, which is of the order of 
magnitude of the shear modulus for magnesium, we obtain for τthe stress at the
saddle point,

The ratio of the theoretical stress to start the shear of the crystal to that observed in a real
crystal is, therefore, approximately
In other words, the crystal deforms plastically at stresses of its theoretical strength.

4.2 DISLOCATIONS
The discrepancy between the computed and real yield stresses is because real crystals
contain defects. Experimental proof for the existence of these defects can be obtained with
the aid of the electron microscope. Thus, suppose that a crystal has been deformed so as
to form visible slip lines, as indicated in Fig. 4.3. Let us now assume that it is possible to
cut from the deformed crystal a transmission electron microscope foil containing a portion
of a slip plane.
If the transmission foil has been prepared properly and contains a section of a slip
plane, when it is examined in the microscope one may obtain a photograph of the type
shown schematically in Fig. 4.5A. In this schematic representation a set of dark lines
may be seen that start and end at the two dashed lines a-aand b-b. The latter lines have
been drawn on the ﬁgure to indicate the positions where the slip plane intersects the foil
surfaces. It should be noted that the drawing in Fig. 4.5A is a two-dimensional projec-
tion of a three-dimensional specimen. So that the geometrical relations involved in this

ﬁgure may be better understood, a three-dimensional sketch of the specimen is shown
in Fig. 4.5B. This diagram demonstrates that the dark lines in the photograph run acrossthe slip plane from the top to the bottom surfaces of the foil. The fact that these lines arevisible in an electron microscope photograph implies that they represent defects in thecrystal structure, as was explained previously in Chapter 2.
We may conclude from the preceding discussion that in a crystal which has under-
gone slip, lattice defects tend to accumulate along the slip planes. These defects arecalled dislocations . The presence of dislocations can also be made evident in another fash-
ion. The points where they intersect a specimen surface can often be made visible byetching the surface with a suitable etching solution. The fact that the dislocations aredefects in the crystal structure tends to make the places where they intersect the surfacepreferred positions for the attack of the etching solution. As a result, etch pits may form.This is indicated schematically in Fig. 4.5C. Photographs showing etch pits associatedwith dislocations may be seen in Figs. 5.3 and 6.3.
An electron microscope photograph is shown in Fig. 4.6. This picture shows a portion
of a foil of an aluminum specimen with a grain containing a slip plane with dislocations.The specimen was polycrystalline. The dark region at the upper right-hand corner repre-sents a second grain. Its orientation was such that it did not diffract as strongly as the largergrain. As a consequence, this crystal appears black.
The fact that dislocations are visible in a transmission electron microscope, and that
they may also be revealed by etching a specimen surface, agrees with the assumptionthat they represent disturbances in the crystal structure. The best evidence now indi-cates that they are boundaries on the slip planes where a shearing operation has ended.Let us look into the nature of these small shears. Figure 4.7A represents a simple cubiccrystal that is assumed to be subjected to shearing stresses, τ, on its upper and lower
surfaces, as indicated in the diagram. The line SPrepresents a possible slip plane in the
crystal. Suppose that as a result of the applied shear stress, the right-hand half of thecrystal is displaced along SPso that the part above the slip plane is moved to the left
with respect to the part below the slip plane. The amount of this shear is assumed toequal one interatomic spacing in a direction parallel to the slip plane. The result of sucha shear is shown in Fig. 4.7B and C. As may be seen in the ﬁgure, this will leave anChapter 4 Introduction to Dislocations 86

extra vertical half-plane cdbelow the slip plane at the right and outside the crystal. It
will also form an extra vertical half-plane ababove the slip plane and in the center of
the crystal. All other vertical planes are realigned so that they run continuously
through the crystal.
Now let us consider the extra half-plane abthat lies inside the crystal. An examina-
tion of Fig. 4.7B clearly shows that the crystal is badly distorted where this half-plane ter-
minates at the slip plane. It can also be deduced that this distortion decreases in intensity
as one moves away from the edge of this half-plane. This is because at large distances from
this lower edge of the extra plane, the atoms tend to be arranged as they would be in a
perfect crystal. The distortion in the crystal is thus centered around the edge of the extra
plane. This boundary of the additional plane is called an edge dislocation . It represents one
of the two basic orientations that a dislocation may take. The other is called a screw
dislocation and will be described shortly.τ

FIG. 4.9 Three stages in the movement of an edge dislocation through a crystalFigure 4.8 represents a three-dimensional sketch of the edge dislocation of Fig. 4.7. The
ﬁgure clearly shows that the dislocation has the dimensions of a line, in agreement with our
discussion of Fig. 4.8. Another important fact shown in Fig. 4.8 is that the dislocation line
marks the boundary between the sheared and unsheared parts of the slip plane. This is a
basic characteristic of a dislocation. In fact, a dislocation may be deﬁned as a line that forms
a boundary on a slip plane between a region that has slipped and one that has not.
Figure 4.9 illustrates how the above dislocation moves through the crystal under an
applied shear stress which is indicated by the vectors τ. As a result of the applied stress,04Ch04.qxd  11/6/08  4:49 PM  Page 88

atom cmay move to the position marked c/H11032in Fig. 4.9B. If it does, the dislocation moves
one atomic distance to the left. The plane x, at the top of the ﬁgure, now runs continu-
ously from top to bottom of the crystal, while plane yends abruptly at the slip plane.
Continued application of the stress will cause the dislocation to move by repeated steps
along the slip plane of the crystal. The ﬁnal result is that the crystal is sheared across the
slip plane by one atomic distance, as is shown in Fig. 4.9C.
Each step in the motion of the dislocation, as can be seen in Figs. 4.9A and B, requires
only a slight rearrangement of the atoms in the neighborhood of the extra plane. As a
result, a very small force will move a dislocation. Theoretical calculations show that this
force is of the correct order of magnitude to account for the low-yield stresses of crystals.
The existence of dislocations was postulated at least a quarter of a century before
experimental techniques were available to make them visible. In 1934, Orowan,1
Polyani,2and Taylor3presented papers which are said to have laid the foundation for the
modern theory of slip due to dislocations.4This early work in the ﬁeld of dislocations in
metal crystals had as its basis an effort to explain the large discrepancy between the
theoretical and observed shear strengths of metal crystals. It was felt that the observed low
yield strengths of real crystals could best be explained on the basis that the crystal con-
tained defects in the form of dislocations. An excellent review of the early concepts of
dislocations can be found in the proceedings of the commemorative ﬁftieth anniversary
meeting held in London in December 1984.5
The movement of a single dislocation completely through a crystal produces a step on
the surface, the depth of which is one atomic distance. Since an atomic distance in metal
crystals is less than a nanometer, such a step will certainly not be visible to the naked eye.
Many hundreds or thousands of dislocations must move across a slip plane in order to pro-
duce a visible slip line. A mechanism will be given presently to show how it is possible to
produce this number of dislocations on a single slip plane inside a crystal. First, however,
it is necessary to deﬁne a screw dislocation, which is shown schematically in Fig. 4.10A,
where each small cube can be considered to represent an atom. Figure 4.10B represents
the same crystal with the position of the dislocation line marked by the line DC. The plane
ABCD is the slip plane. The upper front portion of the crystal has been sheared by one
atomic distance to the left relative to the lower front portion. The designation “screw” for
this lattice defect is derived from the fact that the lattice planes of the crystal spiral the dis-
location line DC. This statement can be proved by starting at point xin Fig. 4.10A and then
proceeding upward and around the crystal in the direction of the arrows. One circuit of
the crystal ends at point y; continued circuits will ﬁnally end at point z.

FIG. 4.10 Two representations of a screw dislocation. Notice that the planes in
this dislocation spiral around the dislocation like a left-hand screw04Ch04.qxd  11/6/08  4:49 PM  Page 89
Figure 4.10B plainly shows that a dislocation in a screw orientation also represents the
boundary between a slipped and an unslipped area. Here the dislocation, centered along
line DC, separates the slipped area ABCD from the remainder of the slip plane in back of
the dislocation.
A model of a screw dislocation can be readily constructed using a stack of ﬁling cards,
or small sheets of paper, and a roll of transparent tape. First, cut halfway through the stack
of cards, as indicated in Fig. 4.11. Then tape (along the cut) the left-hand half of the top
card to the right-hand half of the card just below it. This is indicated in the right-hand part
of the illustration. Now repeat the process through the entire stack. The result should be
a continuous spiral plane that goes entirely through the pack. This is a left-hand screw dis-
location, as can be checked by placing the thumb of the left hand in the direction of the

advance of the spiral plane is toward the thumb.
The edge dislocation shown in Fig. 4.7B has an incomplete plane which lies above
the slip plane. It is also possible to have the incomplete plane below the slip plane. The
two cases are differentiated by calling the former a positive edge dislocation , and the lat-
ter a negative edge dislocation . It should be noted that this differentiation between the
two dislocations is purely arbitrary, for a simple rotation of the crystal of 180° will
convert a positive dislocation into a negative one, and vice versa. Symbols represent-
ing these two forms are and /H11477, respectively, where the horizontal line represents
the slip plane and the vertical line the incomplete plane. There are also two forms of
screw dislocations. The screw dislocation shown in Fig. 4.10 has lattice planes that spi-
ral the line DClike a left-hand screw. An equally probable screw dislocation is one in
which the lattice spirals in a right-hand fashion around the dislocation line. Both
forms of the edge and the screw dislocations, respectively, are shown in Fig. 4.12. The
figure also illustrates how the four types move under the same applied shear stress
(indicated by the vectors τ). As previously mentioned, Fig. 4.12 shows that a positive
edge dislocation moves to the left when the upper half of the lattice is sheared to the
left. On the other hand, a negative edge dislocation moves to the right, but produces
the identical shear of the crystal. The figure also demonstrates that the right-hand
screw moves forward and the left-hand screw moves to the rear, again producing the
same shear of the lattice.
In the preceding examples, the dislocation lines have been assumed to run as
straight lines through the crystal. As explained at the end of Section 4.2, it is a conse-
quence of the basic nature of dislocations that they cannot end inside a crystal. Thus, the
extra plane of an edge dislocation may extend only part way through the crystal, as is/H11036Chapter 4 Introduction to Dislocations 90

dislocation segments aand bthus form a continuous path through the crystal from front
to top surfaces.04Ch04.qxd  11/6/08  4:49 PM  Page 91
It is also possible for all four edges of an incomplete plane to lie inside a crystal,
forming a four-sided closed edge dislocation at the boundaries of the plane.
Furthermore, a dislocation that is an edge in one orientation can change to a screw
in another orientation, as is illustrated in Fig. 4.14. Figure 4.15 shows the same dis-
location viewed from above. Open circles represent atoms lying in the plane just
above the slip plane, while dots represent the atoms just below the slip plane. Notice
that the lattice is sheared by an atomic distance in the region at the lower right-
hand quarter of the figure bounded by the two dislocation segments. Finally, a
dislocation does not need to be either pure screw or pure edge, but may have ori-
entations intermediate to both. This fact signifies that dislocation lines do not have
to be straight, but can be curved. An example is shown in Fig. 4.16. The drawing,
like Fig. 4.15, shows a change in orientation from edge to screw, but here the
change is not abrupt.
Consider the closed rectangular dislocation of Fig. 4.17, consisting of the four
elementary types of dislocations shown in Fig. 4.12. Sides aand care positive and neg-
ative edge dislocations, respectively, while band dare right-and left-hand screws,
respectively. Figure 4.12 shows that, under the indicated shear-stress sense, disloca-
tions aand cmove to the left and right, respectively, while band dmove forward and
to the rear, respectively. The dislocation loop thus opens, or becomes larger, under the
given stress. (It would close, however, if the sense of the stress were reversed.) From
what has been stated previously, it is evident that the dislocation loop abcd does not
need to be rectangular in order to open under the given shearing stress. A closed curve,
such as a circle, would also expand in a similar manner and shear the crystal in the
same way.
It has been mentioned that a dislocation cannot end inside a crystal. This is because a
dislocation represents the boundary between a slipped area and an unslipped area. If the
slipped area on the slip plane does not touch the specimen surface, as in Fig. 4.18, then its
boundary is continuous and the dislocation has to be a closed loop. Only when the slipped
area extends to the specimen surface, as in Fig. 4.13, is it possible for a single dislocation
to have an end point.Chapter 4 Introduction to Dislocations 92

93 4.3 The Burgers Vector
4.3 THE BURGERS VECTOR
The area inside the rectangle abcdof Fig. 4.17, or inside the closed loop of a more general
curved dislocation loop, such as that in Fig. 4.18, is sheared by one atomic distance; that is,
inside this region the lattice lying above the slip plane ( ABCD ) has slipped one atomic
distance to the left relative to the lattice below the slip plane. The direction of this shear is
indicated by the vector , the length of which is one atomic distance. Outside of the
dislocation loop shown in Fig. 4.17, the crystal is not sheared. The dislocation is, therefore,
a discontinuity at which the lattice shifts from the unsheared to the sheared state. Although
the dislocation varies in orientation in the slip plane ABCD , the variation in shear across the
dislocation is everywhere the same, and the slip vector is therefore a characteristic prop-
erty of the dislocation. By deﬁnition, this vector is called the Burgers vector of the dislocation .
The Burgers vector of a dislocation is an important property of a dislocation
because, if the Burgers vector and the orientation of the dislocation line are known,
the dislocation is completely described. Figure 4.19 shows a method of determining
the Burgers vector applied to a positive edge dislocation. It is first necessary to choose
arbitrarily a positive direction for the dislocation. In the present case, let us assume
it to be the direction out of the paper. In Fig. 4.19A a counterclockwise circuit of
atom-to-atom steps in a perfect crystal closes, but when the same step-by-step circuit
is made around a dislocation in an imperfect crystal (Fig. 4.19B), the end point of the
circuit fails to coincide with the starting point. The vector bconnecting the end point b; b;Slip plane This area sheared

with the starting point is the Burgers vector of the dislocation. This procedure can be
used to find the Burgers vectors of any dislocation if the following rules are observed:
1. The circuit is traversed in the same manner as a rotating right-hand screw advan-
cing in the positive direction of the dislocation.
2. The circuit must close in a perfect crystal and must go completely around the
dislocation in the real crystal.
3. The vector that closes the circuit in the imperfect crystal (by connecting the end
point to the starting point) is the Burgers vector.
The above convention involving a right-hand (RH) circuit around the dislocation
line yields a Burgers vector pointing from the ﬁnish to the start (FS) of the circuit, and
because the closure failure is measured in an imperfect crystal, it is called a local Burg-
ers vector or more completely a RHFS local Burgers vector . Alternatively, suppose the
Burgers circuit is ﬁrst made to close in Fig. 4.19B, which shows the crystal containing
a dislocation. In this case the ﬁnishing and starting points will coincide. Then, if a sim-
ilar step-by-step circuit is made in the perfect crystal of Fig. 4.19A, the starting and ﬁn-
ishing points will no longer coincide in this ﬁgure. The resulting closure failure now
occurs in a crystal where there is no distortion, and therefore, it is known as a true
Burgers vector. Since it is measured in a lattice distorted by the strains of the disloca-
tion, the local Burgers vector differs in general from the true Burgers vector. However,
if the size of the Burgers circuit around the dislocation is increased, so that the path of
the Burgers circuit lies in an almost perfect crystal, the two forms of Burgers vectors
will approach each other.
It should be understood that a number of arbitrary assumptions are involved in mak-
ing a Burgers circuit. Thus, one must arbitrarily choose the positive direction of the disloca-
tion line, make a choice on whether the circuit is to be right-handed or left-handed, and
decide whether the sense of the vector is determined from the start to the ﬁnish of the
circuit or vice versa. Unfortunately, in the past not all authors have used the same conven-
tion in choosing their Burgers circuits. For more detailed discussion, see Reference 6.
Figure 4.20 shows a Burgers circuit around a left-hand screw dislocation. In Fig. 4.20A,
the circuit is indicated for the perfect crystal. Figure 4.20B shows the same circuit trans-
ferred to a crystal containing a screw dislocation.Starting point Starting point

95 4.4 Vector Notation for Dislocations
It is now possible to summarize certain characteristics of both edge and screw
dislocations.
1.Edge dislocations :
(a) An edge dislocation lies perpendicular to its Burgers vector.
(b) An edge dislocation moves (in its slip plane) in the direction of the Burgers
vector (slip direction). Under a shear-stress sense Na positive dislocation 
moves to the right, a negative one /H11477to the left.
2.Screw dislocations :
(a) A screw dislocation lies parallel to its Burgers vector.
(b) A screw dislocation moves (in the slip plane) in a direction perpendicular to
the Burgers vector (slip direction).
A useful relationship to remember is that the slip plane is the plane containing
both the Burgers vector and the dislocation. The slip plane of an edge dislocation is
thus uniquely defined because the Burgers vector and the dislocation are perpendi-
cular. On the other hand, the slip plane of a screw dislocation can be any plane
containing the dislocation because the Burgers vector and dislocation have the same
direction. Edge dislocations are thus confined to move or glide in a unique plane, but
screw dislocations can glide in any direction as long as they move parallel to their
original orientation.
4.4 VECTOR NOTATION FOR DISLOCATIONS
Up to this point we have been interested in dislocations only in a general sense. In an
actual crystal, because of the more complex spatial arrangement of atoms, the dislocations
are complicated and often difﬁcult to visualize. It is sometimes convenient to neglect all
considerations of the geometrical appearance of a complicated dislocation and deﬁne the
dislocation by its Burgers vector. The vector notation for Burgers vectors is especially con-
venient here. It has already been pointed out that, in any crystal form, the distance
between atoms in a close-packed direction corresponds to the smallest shear distance that
will preserve the crystal structure during a slip movement. Dislocations with Burgers vec-
tors equal to this shear are energetically the most favored in a given crystal structure. With/H11036Starting and

2[111]FIG. 4.21 The spacing between atoms in the
close-packed directions of the different cubic
systems: face-centered cubic, body-centered
cubic, and simple cubic
regard to the vector notation, the direction of a Burgers vector can be represented by the
Miller indices of its direction, and the length of the vector can be expressed by a suitable
numerical factor placed in front of the Miller indices. Several explanatory examples will
be considered.
Figure 4.21 represents the unit cell for cubic structures. In a simple cubic lattice, the
distance between atoms in a close-packed direction equals the length of one edge of a
unit cell. Now consider the symbol [100]. This quantity may be taken to represent a vec-
tor, such as is shown in Fig. 4.21, with a unit component in the xdirection, and is, accord-
ingly, the distance between atoms in the xdirection. A dislocation with a Burgers vector
parallel to the xdirection in a simple cubic lattice is therefore represented by [100]. Now
consider a face-centered cubic lattice. Here the close-packed direction is a face diagonal,
and the distance between atoms in this direction is equal to one-half the length of the
face diagonal. In Fig. 4.21, the indicated face diagonal obhas indices [101]. This symbol
also corresponds to a vector with unit components in the xand zdirections and a zero
component in the ydirection. As a result, a dislocation in a face-centered cubic lattice
having a Burgers vector lying in the [101] direction should be written [101]. In the
body-centered cubic lattice, the close-packed direction is a cube diagonal, or a direction
of the form /H20855111 /H20856. The distance between atoms in these directions is one-half the length
of the diagonal, so that a dislocation having a Burgers vector parallel to [111], for
example, is written [111].
4.5 DISLOCATIONS IN THE FACE-CENTERED CUBIC LATTICE
The primary slip plane in the face-centered cubic lattice is the octahedral plane {111}.
Figure 4.22 shows a plane of this type looking down on the extra plane of an edge dislo-
cation. The darkened circles represent the close-packed (111) plane at which the extra
plane of the edge dislocation ends, while the white circles are the atoms in the next
following close-packed (111) plane. Notice that in the latter plane a zigzag row of atoms is
missing. This corresponds to the missing plane of the edge dislocation. Now consider the
plane of atoms (lying directly over the zigzag row of white atoms) immediately to the left1
21
204Ch04.qxd  11/6/08  4:49 PM  Page 96
97 4.5 Dislocations in the Face-Centered Cubic Lattice
of the missing plane of atoms. The movement of the atoms of this plane through the hor-
izontal distance bdisplaces the dislocation one unit to the left. The vector bthus represents
the Burgers vector of the dislocation, which is designated as [ 10], according to the
method outlined in the preceding section. Similar movements in succession of the planes
of atoms that ﬁnd themselves to the left of the dislocation will cause the dislocation to
move across the entire crystal. As is to be expected, this dislocation movement shears the
upper half of the crystal (above the plane of the paper) one unit bto the right relative to
the bottom half (below the plane of the paper).
A dislocation of the type shown in Fig. 4.22 does not normally move in the simple
manner discussed in the preceding paragraph. As can be deduced with the aid of the
ping-pong-ball model of the atom arrangement shown in Fig. 4.22, the movement of a
zigzag plane of atoms, such as aa, through the horizontal distance bwould involve a
very large lattice strain, because each white atom at the slip plane would be forced to
climb over the dark atom below it and to its right. What actually is believed to happen
is that the indicated plane of atoms makes the move indicated by the vectors marked c
in Fig. 4.23. This movement can occur with a much smaller strain of the lattice. A
second movement of the same type, indicated by the vectors marked d, brings the atoms
to the same ﬁnal positions as the single displacement bof Fig. 4.22.
The atom arrangement of Fig. 4.23 is particularly signiﬁcant because it shows how a
single-unit dislocation can break down into a pair of partial dislocations. Thus, the isolated
single zigzag row of atoms has an incomplete dislocation on each side of it. The Burgers
vectors of these dislocations are the vectors cand dshown in the ﬁgure. The vector nota-
tion for these Burgers vectors can be deduced with the aid of Fig. 4.24. This ﬁgure shows
the (111) surface of a face-centered cubic crystal in relation to the unit cell of the structure.
The positions of the atoms in this surface are indicated by circles drawn with dashed lines.
The places that would be occupied by the atoms in the next plane above the given one are
designated by small circles with the letter Binside them. In the center of Fig. 4.24 is another11

component of 2 in the ydirection. This is a vector the length of which is twice the distance

tion is [ 2 ]. In the same manner, it can be shown that the vector CB2111

can be represented by [ 11]. The total face-centered cubic dislocation [ 10] is thus able
to dissociate into two partial dislocations according to the relation
[ 10] /H11005[2] /H11001[ 11] 4.4
When a total dislocation breaks down into a pair of partials, the strain energy of the
lattice is decreased. This results because the energy of a dislocation is proportional to the
square of its Burgers vector (see Eqs. 4.19 and 4.20) and because the square of the Burgers
vector of the total dislocation is more than twice as large as the square of the Burgers vec-
tor of a partial dislocation. Because the partial dislocations of Fig. 4.23 represent approxi-
mately equal lattice strains, a repulsive force exists between them that forces the partials
apart. Such a separation will add additional planes of atoms to the single zigzag plane of
Fig. 4.23, as shown in Fig. 4.25. A total dislocation that has dissociated into a pair of sep-
arated partials like those in the latter ﬁgure is known as an extended dislocation . An impor-
tant fact to notice about Fig. 4.25 is that the white atoms that lie between the two partial
dislocations have stacking positions which differ from those of the atoms on the far side of
either of the partial dislocations. Thus, if we assume that the dark-colored atoms occupy
Apositions in a stacking sequence and the white atoms at either end of the ﬁgure, Bposi-
tions, then the white atoms between the two partial dislocations lie on Cpositions. In this
region, the ABCABCABC . . . stacking sequence of the face-centered cubic lattice suffers a
discontinuity and becomes ABCAb
cCABCA ....  The arrows indicate the discontinuity.
Discontinuities in the stacking order of the {111}, or close-packed planes, are called stack-
ing faults . In the present example, the stacking fault occurs on the slip plane (between the
dark and white atoms) and is bounded at its ends by what are known as Shockley partial
dislocations . In a face-centered cubic lattice, stacking faults may arise in a number of other
ways. In all cases, if a stacking fault terminates inside a crystal, its boundaries will form a
partial dislocation. The partial dislocations of stacking faults, in general, may be either of
the Shockley type, with the Burgers vector of the dislocation lying in the plane of the fault,
or of the Frank type, with the Burgers vector normal to the stacking fault. The partial 
dislocations presently being considered, however, are only those associated with slip and
are of the Shockley form. Figure 4.26 shows examples of stacking faults bordered by21

faults bordered by two dislocations in the lower-left- and upper-right-hand sides. The dis-
locations, which are not straight, are [10 ] and [5 ], respectively.7The defect marked by
B shows a narrow region of stacking fault surrounded by Shockley partial dislocations.
Since the atoms on either side of a stacking fault are not at the positions they would
normally occupy in a perfect lattice, a stacking fault possesses a surface energy which, ingeneral, is small compared with that of an ordinary grain boundary, but neverthelessﬁnite. This stacking-fault energy plays an important part in determining the size of anextended dislocation. The larger the separation between the partial dislocations, thesmaller is the repulsive force between them. On the other hand, the total surface energyassociated with the stacking fault increases with the distance between partial dislocations.The separation between the two partials thus represents an equilibrium between therepulsive energy of the dislocations and the surface energy of the fault. Seeger andSchoeck
8,9have shown that the separation of the pair of partial dislocations in an extended
dislocation depends on a dimensionless parameter /H9253Ic/Gb2, where /H9253Iis the speciﬁc surface
energy of the stacking fault, Gis the shear modulus in the slip plane, cis the separation
between adjoining slip planes, and bis the magnitude of the Burgers vector. In certain
face-centered cubic metals typiﬁed by aluminum, this parameter is larger than 10/H110022and32 104Ch04.qxd  11/6/08  4:49 PM  Page 100
101 4.6 Intrinsic and Extrinsic Stacking Faults in Face-Centered Cubic Metals
the separation between dislocations is only of the order of a single atomic distance. These
metals are said to have high stacking-fault energies. When the parameter is less than 10/H110022,
a metal is said to have a low stacking-fault energy. A typical example of a metal with a low
stacking-fault energy is copper. The computed9separation of the partial dislocations in
copper are of the order of twelve interatomic spacings if the extended dislocation is in the
edge orientation, and about ﬁve interatomic spacings if it is in the screw orientation.
A word should be said about the movement of an extended dislocation through a
crystal. The actual movement may be quite complicated for several reasons. First, if the
moving dislocation meets obstacles, such as other dislocations, or even second-phase
particles, the width of the stacking fault should vary. Second, thermal vibrations may also
cause the width of the stacking fault to vary locally along the dislocation, the variation
being a function of time. On the assumption that these and other complicating effects can
be neglected, an extended dislocation can be pictured as a pair of partial dislocations, sep-
arated by a ﬁnite distance, which move in consort through the crystal. The ﬁrst partial dis-
location, as it moves, changes the stacking order, while the second restores the order to its
proper sequence. After both partials have passed a given point in the lattice, the crystal will
have been sheared (at the slip plane) by an amount equal to the Burgers vector bof the
total dislocation.
4.6 INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC STACKING FAULTS 
IN FACE-CENTERED CUBIC METALS
The movement of a Shockley partial across the slip plane of a fcc metal has been shown
to produce a stacking sequence ABCAb
cCABCA ....  I n  this case the normal stacking
sequence can be observed to exist right up to the plane of the fault. A fault of this type, fol-
lowing Frank, is called an intrinsic stacking fault . An intrinsic stacking fault may also be devel-
oped in a fcc crystal by removing part of a close-packed plane, as shown in Fig. 4.27A.
Such a method of developing an intrinsic stacking fault is physically quite possible and can
occur by the condensation of vacancies on an octahedral plane. While the fault produced

in this manner is the same as that resulting from the slip of a Shockley partial, the partial
dislocation surrounding the fault is not the same. In this case it is normal to the {111} slipplane and therefore of the Frank type. Its Burgers vector is equal to one-third of a total dis-location and therefore may be written /H20855111/H20856.
The addition of a portion of an octahedral plane produces a different type of stacking
sequence which is ABCA
b
cCb
cBCABC . . . . In this fault (Fig. 4.27B) a plane has been
inserted that is not correctly stacked with respect to the planes on either side of the fault.This type of fault is called an extrinsic or double stacking fault . The Burgers vector for the
extrinsic fault, shown in Fig. 4.27B, is also /H20855111/H20856. An extrinsic stacking fault could be
formed by the precipitation of interstitial atoms on an octahedral plane. This is believed tobe much less probable than the condensation of vacancies to produce an intrinsic fault. Itis also possible to form extrinsic stacking faults by the slip of Shockley partials. However,to do this one normally has to assume that this type of slip occurs on two neighboringplanes.

4.7 EXTENDED DISLOCATIONS IN HEXAGONAL METALS
Because the basal plane of a hexagonal metal has exactly the same close-packedarrangement of atoms as the octahedral {111} plane of face-centered cubic metals,extended dislocations also occur in these metals. In the hexagonal system, the dissoci-ation of a total dislocation into a pair of partials on the basal plane is expressed in thefollowing fashion:
[20 ] /H11005[01 0] /H11001[ 100] 4.5
This equation represents exactly the same addition of Burgers vectors as given in the pre-vious section for the face-centered cubic system, namely,
[ 10] /H11005[2] /H11001[ 11] 4.6
The only difference between the two equations lies in the present use of the four-digitMiller indices for hexagonal metals. The stacking fault associated with extended disloca-tions in the hexagonal metals is similar to that of the face-centered metals. The movementof the ﬁrst partial dislocation through the crystal changes the stacking sequenceABABABABAB . . . to ABACBCBCBC . . . on the assumption that the fourth plane slips rel-
ative to the third. Notice that the sequence CBCBCB . . . is a perfectly good hexagonal
sequence with alternate planes lying above one another. The stacking fault occurs betweenthe third and fourth planes: between A
b
cC . . . . As in the face-centered cubic example, the
movement of the second partial dislocation restores the crystal to the proper stackingsequence ABABAB . . . .
4.8 CLIMB OF EDGE DISLOCATIONS
The slip plane of a dislocation is deﬁned as the plane that contains both the dislocation andits Burgers vector. Since the Burgers vector is parallel to a screw dislocation, any planecontaining the dislocation is a possible slip plane. (See Fig. 4.28A.) On the other hand, theBurgers vector of an edge dislocation is perpendicular to the dislocation, and there is onlyone possible slip plane. (See Fig. 4.28B.) A screw dislocation may move by slip or glide inany direction perpendicular to itself, but an edge dislocation can only glide in its single slip21

103 4.8 Climb of Edge Dislocations
plane. There is, however, another method, fundamentally different from slip, by which an
edge dislocation can move. This process is called climb and involves motion in a direction
perpendicular to the slip plane.
Figure 4.29A represents a view of an edge dislocation with the extra plane perpen-
dicular to the plane of the paper and designated by ﬁlled circles. In this diagram, a
vacancy or vacant lattice site has moved up to a position just to the right of atom a, one
of the atoms forming the edge or boundary of the extra plane. If atom ajumps into the
vacancy, the edge of the dislocation loses one atom, as is shown in Fig. 4.29B, where
atom c, designated with a crossed circle, represents the next atom of the edge (lying just
below the plane of the paper). If atom cand all others that formed the original edge of
the extra planes move off through interaction with vacancies, the edge dislocation will
climb one atomic distance in a direction perpendicular to the slip plane. This situation is
shown in Fig. 4.29C. Climb, as illustrated in the above example, is designated as positive
climb and results in a decrease in size of the extra plane. Negative climb corresponds to
the opposite of the above in that the extra plane grows in size instead of shrinking. A
mechanism for negative climb is illustrated in Fig. 4.30A and Fig. 4.30B.
In this case, let us suppose that atom aof Fig. 4.30A moves to the left and joins
the extra plane, leaving a vacancy to its right, as is shown in Fig. 4.30B. This vacancy
then moves off into the crystal. Notice that this is again an atom by atom procedure
and not a cooperative movement of the entire row of atoms lying behind atom a.b b Screw dislocation

Thus, atom c(crossed circle), shown in Fig. 4.30B, represents the atom originally
behind atom a. A cooperative movement of all atoms in the row behind acorresponds
to slip and not to climb.
Because we are removing material from inside the crystal as the extra plane itself
grows smaller, the effect of positive climb on the crystal is to cause it to shrink in a
direction parallel to the slip plane (perpendicular to the extra plane). Positive climb
is therefore associated with a compressive strain and will be promoted by a compres-
sive stress component perpendicular to the extra plane. Similarly, a tensile stress
applied perpendicular to the extra plane of an edge dislocation promotes the growth
of the plane and thus negative climb. A fundamental difference therefore exists
between the nature of the stress that produces slip and that which produces climb.
Slip occurs as the result of shear stress; climb as the result of a normal stress (tensile
or compressive).
Both positive and negative climb require that vacancies move through the lattice,
toward the dislocation in the ﬁrst case and away from it in the second case. If the
concentration of vacancies and their jump rate is very low, then it is not expected that
edge dislocations will climb. As we shall see, vacancies in most metals are practically
immobile at low temperatures (one jump in eleven days in copper at room tempera-
ture), but at high temperatures they move with great rapidity, and their equilibrium
number increases exponentially by many powers. Climb, therefore, is a phenomenon
that becomes increasingly important as the temperature rises. Slip, on the other hand,
is only slightly inﬂuenced by temperature.
4.9 DISLOCATION INTERSECTIONS
The dislocations in a metal constitute a three-dimensional network of linear faults. On any
given slip plane, there will be a certain number of dislocations that lie in this plane and are
capable of producing slip along it. At the same time, there will be many other dislocations
that intersect it at various angles. Consequently, when a dislocation moves it must pass
through those dislocations that intersect its slip plane. The cutting of dislocations by other
dislocations is an important subject because, in general, it requires work to make the inter-
sections. The relative ease or difﬁculty with which slip occurs is thus determined in part
by the intersection of dislocations.
For a simple example of the result of a dislocation intersection, see Fig. 4.31. In the
drawing it is assumed that a dislocation has moved across the slip plane ABCD , thereby
shearing the top half of the rectangular crystal relative to the bottom half by the length
of its Burgers vector b. A second (vertical) dislocation, having a loop that intersects the
slip plane at two points, is shown in Fig. 4.31. It is assumed, for the sake of convenience,
that this loop is in the edge orientation where it intersects the slip plane. The indicateda a c

105 4.9 Dislocation Intersections
displacement of the crystal, shown in Fig. 4.31, also shears the top half of the vertical-
dislocation loop relative to its bottom half by the amount of the Burgers vector b. This
shearing action cannot break the loop into two separated half-loops because, according
to rule, a dislocation cannot end inside a crystal. The only alternative is that the displace-
ment lengthens the vertical-dislocation loop by an amount equal to the two horizontal
steps shown in Fig. 4.31. This result is characteristic of the intersection of dislocations,
for whenever a dislocation cuts another dislocation, both dislocations acquire steps of a
size equal to the other’s Burgers vector.
Let us now consider some of the simpler types of steps, formed by dislocation inter-
sections. The two basic cases are, ﬁrst, where the step lies in the slip plane of a disloca-
tion and, second, where the step is normal to the slip plane of a dislocation. The ﬁrst
type is called a kink, while the second is called a jog. The ﬁrst is treated in Fig. 4.32.
Here (A) represents a dislocation in the edge orientation, and (B) a dislocation in the
screw orientation, both of which have received kinks ( on) as a result of intersections
with other dislocations. The kink in the edge dislocation has a screw orientation
(Burgers vector parallel to line on), while the step in the screw dislocation has an edge
orientation (Burgers vector normal to line on). Both of these steps can easily be elimi-
nated, for example, by moving line mnover to the position of the dashed line. This
movement in both cases can occur by simple slip. Since the elimination of a step low-
ers the energy of the crystal by the amount of the strain energy associated with a step,
it can be assumed that steps of this type may tend to disappear.
An edge and a screw dislocation, with steps normal to the primary slip plane, are
shown in Figs. 4.33A and 4.33B. This type of discontinuity is called a jog. It should be noted
that the jog of Fig. 4.33B is also capable of elimination if the dislocation is able to move in
a plane normal to the indicated slip plane, that is, in a vertical plane. This follows from the
fact that if this stepped dislocation is viewed as lying in a vertical plane, then we have the
same step arrangement as that shown in Fig. 4.32B. However, let us assume that bothScrew

FIG. 4.33 Dislocations with jogs normal to their slip planes
dislocations of Fig. 4.33 are not capable of gliding in a vertical plane. What then is the
effect of the steps on the motion of the dislocations in their horizontal-slip surfaces? In this
respect, it is evident that the edge dislocation with a jog, shown in Fig. 4.33A, is free to
move on the stepped surface shown in the ﬁgure, for all three segments of the dislocation,
mn, no , and op, are in a simple edge orientation with their respective Burgers vectors lying
in the crystal planes that contain the dislocation segments. The only difference between
the motion of this dislocation and an ordinary edge dislocation is that instead of gliding
along a single plane it moves over a stepped surface.
The screw dislocation with a jog, shown in Fig. 4.33B, represents quite a different case.
Here the jog is an edge dislocation with an incomplete plane lying in the stepped surface.
For the sake of argument, let us assume that its extra plane lies to the left of line noand
thus corresponds to the cross-hatched area in Fig. 4.33B. Now there are two basic ways
that an incomplete plane that is only one atomic spacing high can be formed. In the ﬁrst
case, it can be assumed that the shaded area corresponds to a row of interstitial atoms
which ends at no. Alternatively, the shaded step may be considered a part of a normal
continuous lattice plane, and then the stepped surface to the right of nowould have to be
a row of vacancies. The latter case is the one indicated in the drawing in Fig. 4.33B.

107 4.10 The Stress Field of a Screw Dislocation
Burgers vectors of the two dislocations, the intersection of which caused the jog. In this
respect, it should be mentioned that these jogs are formed when one screw dislocationintersects another screw dislocation. The other steps illustrated in Figs. 4.32 and 4.33A areformed by various intersections involving edge dislocations with other edges, or edgedislocations with screws. Read
10discusses these different possibilities in detail and shows
in particular how the intersection of two screw dislocations can lead, at least in principle,to the production of either a row of vacancies or a row of interstitial atoms. Relative tothese rows of vacancies, or interstitial atoms, it should be pointed out that after one screwdislocation has intersected another, and if it moves on away from the point of intersection,the row of point defects (vacancies or interstitial atoms) stretches in a line from the mov-ing dislocation back to the stationary one. This, of course, is on the assumption that ther-mal energy does not cause the point defects to diffuse off into the lattice. In terms ofFig. 4.33B, this signiﬁes that if the indicated dislocation is moving to the left, the row ofvacancies to its right extends back to another screw dislocation, whose intersection by themoving dislocation caused the row of vacancies to be formed.
Although the edge dislocation with a jog normal to its slip plane is capable of moving
by simple glide along the stepped surface of Fig. 4.33A, this is not the case of the steppedscrew dislocation of Fig. 4.33B. Here the jog (line no), which is in an edge orientation, is not
capable of gliding along the vertical surface shown in the ﬁgure because its Burgers vectoris not in the surface of the step but is normal to it. The only way that the jog can moveacross the surface of the step is for it to move by dislocation climb. Thus, in Fig. 4.33B, ifthe jog is to move to the left with the rest of the dislocation, additional vacancies will haveto be added to the row of vacancies (to the right of line no). Alternatively, if the extra plane
had been formed by a row of interstitial atoms to the left of the jog, the movement of thejog (in this case to the right) requires the creation of additional interstitial atoms. In gen-eral, when dislocations pass each other, they leave various defects or “debries” behind.
11
Figure 4.34 schematically shows some of these defects.
4.10 THE STRESS FIELD OF A SCREW DISLOCATION
The elastic strain of a screw dislocation is shown in Fig. 4.35. In this form of dislocation,the lattice spirals around the center of the dislocation, with the result that a state ofshear strain is set up in the lattice. This strain is symmetrical about the center of the dis-location and its magnitude varies inversely as the distance from the dislocation center.Vector diagrams are drawn on the front and top of the cylindrical crystal to indicate theshear sense.
That the strain decreases as one moves away from the dislocation line is deduced
as follows. Consider the circular Burgers circuit shown in Fig. 4.35. Such a path resultsin an advance (parallel to the dislocation line) equal to the Burgers vector b. The strain
in the lattice, however, is the advance divided by the distance around the dislocation.Thus,

homogeneous isotropic bodies. If this is done, the elastic stress ﬁeld surrounding a screw
dislocation is written:
4.8
where /H9262is the shear modulus of the material of the crystal. This equation gives a reason-
able approximation of the stress at distances greater than several atomic distances from the
center of the dislocation. As the center of the dislocation is approached, however, represen-
tation of the crystal as a homogeneous and isotropic medium becomes less and less realis-
tic. At positions close to the dislocation, atoms are displaced long distances from their
normal lattice positions. Under these conditions, the stress is no longer directly proportional
to strain, and it becomes necessary to think in terms of forces between individual atoms.
The analysis of the stresses close to the center of the dislocation is extremely difﬁcult, and
no completely satisfactory theory has yet been developed. In this respect, it should be men-
tioned that the inﬁnite stress predicted by Eq. 4.8 at zero radius has no meaning. While the
exact stress at the center of the dislocation is not known, it cannot be inﬁnite.
4.11 THE STRESS FIELD OF AN EDGE DISLOCATION
The stress ﬁeld surrounding a dislocation in an edge orientation is more complex than that
of a dislocation in a screw orientation. It will now be assumed that an edge dislocation lies in
an inﬁnitely large and elastically isotropic material and that the dislocation line coincides
with the zaxis of a Cartesian coordinate system. Under these conditions the stress can be con-
sidered to be independent of position along the zdirection. In other words, the stress should
be simply a function of its position in the x, yplane, the plane normal to the dislocation. In
this regard, consider Fig. 4.36A, where an edge dislocation is shown lying at the origin of a
two-dimensional x, ycoordinate system. With the aid of elasticity theory it may be shown
that the stress at some point, with coordinates xand y, has the following components:τ/H11005mg/H11005mb

In the general case, that is, for an arbitrary position with coordinates xand y, the stress
will contain both normal and shear stress components and /H9268xxmay not equal /H9268yy. However,
for points along the x-axis the normal stress components both vanish and the state of stress
is pure shear. Also note that the sense of the shear stress along the xaxis, which corresponds
to the slip plane, is reversed if one moves from the right of the dislocation to its left, as may
be seen in Fig. 4.37. Also, as may be seen in Fig. 4.37, above and below the dislocation, that
is, along the yaxis, there is no shear stress component. Here the stress is a biaxial normalτxy/H11005mb

below it the lattice is in a state of tensile stress. Note that the magnitude of the stress
depends only on the distance from the dislocation, r, and varies as 1/ r.
A signiﬁcant fact is that the stress ﬁeld around a dislocation can be described in a
somewhat simpler fashion if one uses polar coordinates as deﬁned in Fig. 4.38. In this case

4.12 THE FORCE ON A DISLOCATION
The concept of the virtual force that a stress applied to a crystal exerts on a disloca-
tion is important. The force exerted on a straight screw dislocation by a shear stress
will be examined first. Figure 4.39 shows a right-hand screw dislocation, which is
assumed to lie far enough away from the crystal ends that surface end effects may be
ignored. The length of this dislocation, L, equals the crystal width. Now imagine that
the dislocation moves along the slip plane through a distance /H9004y. This causes a section
of the top half of the crystal of width Land length /H9004yto be displaced to the left by a
Burgers vector, b, relative to the bottom half. The external work Wdone by the
applied stress in this movement of the dislocation is equivalent to that of a force τL/H9004x
moving through a distance bor

where τis the applied shear stress, Lthe crystal width, and /H9004xthe distance the dislocation

internal work to the external gives
fL/H9004x/H11005τL/H9004xb
or
f/H11005τb 4.12
The force per unit length on the dislocation, f, lies in the slip plane and is normal to the
dislocation line, that is, it is toward the front of the crystal.
Now consider Fig. 4.40, in which a positive edge dislocation is assumed to move
through a distance /H9004xunder an applied shear stress τ. The dislocation line length and crys-
tal width are again assumed to equal L. By an argument similar to that just used for the
screw dislocation, it may be easily shown that the force per unit length on the edge com-
ponent of a dislocation line is also
f/H11005τb 4.13
This force also lies in the slip plane and is normal to the dislocation line. Note that since
the screw and edge components of the same dislocation are normal to each other, the
forces on these components must also be normal to each other. It can also be shown
that if a part of a dislocation has a mixed—part edge and part screw—character, the
corresponding force per unit length, f, on the segment is also normal to it. Thus, a dis-
location loop, such as that shown in Fig. 4.18, will be subjected to a force normal to the
dislocation f/H11005τbeverywhere around the loop.
There remains to be considered the climb force on an edge dislocation. Here the stress
applied to the crystal is a normal (tensile or compressive) stress. Thus, consider Fig. 4.41,FIG. 4.39 A right-hand screw dislocation in a long crystalz

where fis the force on the dislocation line, /H9268the tensile stress, and bthe Burgers vector
of the dislocation. The climb force on a dislocation is not only normal to the dislocation
line but it is also normal to the slip plane of the dislocation. This is in contrast to the direc-tion of fin slip, which is also always normal to the dislocation line but lies in the slip
plane. If the applied stress is purely compressive, the climb force will point toward thepositive zdirection and the dislocation should climb upward.
In the general case, however, a dislocation may have a mixed Burgers vector, so that
it is neither pure screw nor pure edge, and the dislocation line may lie in any direction.Thus, it is common practice to deﬁne the orientation of the dislocation line, at a givenpoint along it, by the unit vector tangent to the dislocation line at the point. This vector isdesignated /H9256and has the components /H9256
x, /H9256y, and /H9256z. Furthermore, the Burgers vector can
be expressed in the form
b/H11005bxi/H11001byj/H11001bzk 4.15
where bx, by, and bzare three components of the Burgers vector and i, j, and kare unit vec-
tors in the x, y, and zdirections, respectively.
When a general stress /H9018, which may have both normal and shear components in all
three directions, is applied to a crystal containing a dislocation, the force on the dislocationis given by the cross-product of /H9018and /H9256, which can be written as

where fis the force per unit length on the dislocation, and /H9018

Because of the cross-product between /H9018and /H9256in Eq. 4.16, the force on the dislocation is
normal to the dislocation. The relation between the dislocation, its Burgers vector, and thestress, given above, can be written
F/H11005(b/H11080G)X/H9256 4.18
This is known as the Peach-Kohler equation. More detailed discussion on this subject canbe found elsewhere.

4.13 THE STRAIN ENERGY OF A SCREW DISLOCATION
An important property of a dislocation is its strain energy, normally expressed as its energyper unit length. This parameter can be readily obtained for a screw dislocation located atthe center of an inﬁnitely long, large cylindrical crystal. According to linear elasticitytheory, the strain energy density in the stress ﬁeld of a screw dislocation is 
τ2/2/H9262, and byf/H11005/H20858Xz/H11005ij k

115 4.14 The Strain Energy of an Edge Dislocation
Eq. 4.8 the stress, τ, is /H9262b/2/H9266r. This suggests that the strain energy per unit length of this
screw dislocation might be estimated with the following integration.
4.19
where wsis the energy per unit length of the screw dislocation, /H9262the shear modulus, bthe
Burgers vector, r0an inner radius that excludes the dislocation core, and r/H11032an outer lim-
iting radius for the integration. A unit thickness is assumed for the volume over which the
integration is made.
The choices of r0and r/H11032involve the consideration of a number of factors. First, with
regard to r0, Eq. 4.19 clearly indicates that as r0:0, w:/H11009, implying that a lower limit
for r0is necessary. This conclusion is also strengthened by the fact that near the disloca-
tion center, the atomistic character of a crystal becomes more and more signiﬁcant and theassumption that the crystal is a simple elastic continuum becomes less and less tenable.Further, while the strain certainly must be very severe, in this region, it can never beinﬁnite as predicted by Eq. 4.7 for r
0/H110050. For these reasons it is normally assumed that
linear elasticity does not hold below r0/H11011b, where bis the Burgers vector. However, in
order to include the energy in the highly strained region of the dislocation core it has beensuggested
6that one take r0/H11005b//H9251, where /H9251is a constant. The value of /H9251has been variously
suggested to be between 2 and 4. For the present let /H9251/H110054.
Equation 4.19 also indicates that w:/H11009as r/H11032:/H11009. Fortunately, a crystal normally pos-
sesses a ﬁnite dislocation density. Even a well-annealed crystal may contain about10
8cm/cm3(1012m/m3) of dislocations. Under these conditions the stress ﬁeld of a dislo-
cation may be assumed to be neutralized by those of its neighbors at a distance r/H11032equal to
one-half the average spacing between dislocations. This assumption is reasonable if thenumbers of the dislocations with opposite signs are approximately equal.
Assuming that one has a soft iron crystal with an array of inﬁnitely long
straight screw dislocations, with equal numbers of opposite signs, and whose density

the dislocation density, a rough estimate of the stored strain energy in a unit volume mayalso be computed. Thus for 
/H9267/H11005108cm/cm3the stored energy in a cm3should be about

FIG. 5.2 Various stages in the
generation of a dislocation loop
at a Frank-Read sourceThe dislocation topics in the preceding chapter dealt primarily with (1) the structure or
geometry of dislocations and (2) their stress and strain ﬁelds. This chapter is concerned
with the relation of dislocations to plastic deformation. The ﬁrst topic to be considered
involves a mechanism proposed some years ago to explain why the amount of shear strain
that is obtained when a soft (annealed) crystal specimen is plastically deformed is normally
many times greater than could be attained from slip due to the glide of the dislocations
that existed in the crystal before the start of the deformation. This clearly indicates that dis-
locations must be created during plastic deformation. While there are a number of ways
that dislocations may be created as a result of plastic deformation, the Frank-Read source
is one of considerable historical signiﬁcance.
5.1 THE FRANK-READ SOURCE
Suppose that a positive edge dislocation, lying in plane ABCD of Fig. 5.1, is connected to
two other edge dislocations running vertically to the upper surface of the crystal. The two
vertical edge dislocations cannot move under the applied shear stress τ. This is because, in
general, the movement of a dislocation results in the displacement of a part of a crystal
relative to an adjacent part. When an externally applied stress causes such a movement,
the externally applied stress moves and performs work. Movements of the vertical
dislocation segments will cause shear displacements between front and back parts of the
crystal. The applied shear stress τon the top and bottom of the crystal cannot cause this
type of displacement. The vertical segments would move, however, under a shear stress in
the horizontal direction applied to the front and back of the crystal. Since the dislocation
segment xyis a positive edge, the stress τwill tend to move it to the left, causing the line
to form an arc with ends at the ﬁxed endpoints xand y. This arc is indicated in Fig. 5.2 by

the symbol a. Further application of the stress causes the curved dislocation to expand to
the successive positions band c. At cthe loop intersects itself at point m, but since one inter-
secting segment is a left-hand screw and the other a right-hand screw, the segments can-
cel each other at the point of intersection. (A cancellation always occurs when oppositeforms of dislocations lying in the same plane intersect. This fact can be easily demonstratedfor the case of positive and negative edge dislocations since their intersections form a com-plete lattice plane from two incomplete planes.) The cancellation of the dislocation seg-ments at the point of contact mbreaks the dislocation into two segments marked d, one of
which is circular and expands to the surface of the crystal, producing a shear of one atomicdistance. The other component remains as a regenerated positive edge, lying betweenpoints xand ywhere it is in a position to repeat the cycle. In this manner many disloca-
tion loops can be generated on the same slip plane, and a shear can be produced that islarge enough to account for the large size of observed slip lines. A dislocation generator ofthis type is called a Frank-Read source .
5.2 NUCLEATION OF DISLOCATIONS
Experimental evidence shows that Frank-Read sources actually exist in crystals.1How
important these dislocation generators are in the plastic deformation of metals is notknown, but other evidence shows that dislocations can also be formed without the aid ofFrank-Read or similar sources.
2If dislocations are not formed by dislocation generators,
then they must be created by a nucleation process. As with all nucleation phenomena, dis-locations can be created in two ways: homogeneously or heterogeneously. In the case ofdislocations, homogeneous nucleation means that they are formed in a perfect lattice by the
action of a simple stress, no agency other than stress being required. Heterogeneous nucle-
ation, on the other hand, signiﬁes that dislocations are formed with the help of defects
present in the crystal, perhaps impurity particles. The defects make the formation of dislo-cations easier by lowering the applied stress required to form dislocations. It is universallyagreed that homogeneous nucleation of dislocations requires extremely high stresses,stresses that theoretically are of the order of to of the shear modulus of a crystal.
3
Since the shear modulus of a metal is usually about 7 to 70 GPa, the stress to form dislo-cations should be of the order of 0.7 GPa. However, the actual shear stress at which metalcrystals start to deform by slip is usually around 70 MPa. This evidence certainly favors theopinion that if dislocations are not formed by Frank-Read sources, then they must benucleated heterogeneously.
It should be noted that dislocations can also nucleate heterogeneously at the crystal
surface and at critical stresses much less than that required for homogenous nucleationwithin the crystal. Moreover, the critical stress is further reduced when the crystal surfaceis not perfectly ﬂat and contains heterogeneities, such as atomic scale surface steps. Forexample, the recent atomic scale calculations by Guanshui Xu and co-workers
4,5indicated
that, compared to nucleation of screw dislocation at a perfectly ﬂat surface, the requiredcritical stress is reduced by about an order of magnitude at the presence of surface steps.Stress concentration at the heterogenetics and thermal ﬂuctuations are thought to play acritical role in the nucleation of such dislocations.
Metal crystals are not particularly suited to an investigation of nucleation phenomena.
When prepared by solidiﬁcation or other means, they usually possess a relatively high den-sity of dislocations in the form of a more-or-less random network that extends throughoutthe specimen. Our present interest does not lie in these networks, but in the creation of new,1

121 5.2 Nucleation of Dislocations
independent dislocation loops. A high concentration of grown-in dislocations, however,
complicates the observation of nucleation phenomena. Also, in metals, slip occurs readily sothat once the yield point is reached, many dislocations usually form at the same time. Theseexperimental difﬁculties are almost eliminated if dislocation nucleation is studied in crystalsof lithium ﬂuoride,
6which is an ionic salt that crystallizes in the simple cubic (rock salt) lat-
tice. This material may be prepared in single-crystal form with a high degree of perfection sothat it has a low density of grown-in dislocations (5 /H1100310
4cm of dislocations per cubic cm).
In addition, crystals of LiF are rigid enough at room temperature to be handled without dis-tortion, and they are only slightly plastic at this temperature. Thus, with a small stress (5 to7 MPa) applied for a short period of time, dislocations can be formed in them in controlledsmall numbers.
One of the best and simplest ways of observing dislocations in crystals is through the
use of an etching reagent, which forms an etch pit on the surface of a crystal at each pointwhere a dislocation intersects the surface. This method is not without its difﬁculties forthere is often no way of knowing whether the etch reveals all dislocations, or whether someof the pits are due to other defects. In lithium ﬂuoride, the etch-pit method seems to behighly reliable.
6Several etching solutions have been developed7for use in LiF, one of which
is capable of distinguishing between grown-in dislocations and newly formed dislocations.The action of this solution can be seen in Fig. 5.3. The large square pits that run in two hor-izontal rows are associated with newly formed dislocations. The horizontal rows deﬁne theintercept of the slip plane of these dislocations with the surface. In addition to the large pits,there are two intersecting curved rows of closely spaced smaller pits. The latter outline whatis known as a low-angle grain boundary . (See Chapter 6.) The boundaries actually consist of
FIG. 5.3 The large square etched pits in horizontal rows correspond to dislocations
formed in LiF at room temperature, while the smaller, closely spaced pits lying in
curved rows were grown into the crystal when it was manufactured (Gilman, J. J.,and Johnson, W. G., Dislocations and Mechanical Properties of Crystals , p. 116, John
Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1957. Used by permission of the author.)05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 121
Chapter 5 Dislocations and Plastic Deformation 122
a number of closely spaced dislocations. It should be noted that the given etching solution
forms large pits at new dislocations and small pits at network dislocations. The reason for
this ability of the etch to distinguish between the two types of dislocations is not under-
stood, but it might be related to the fact that impurity atoms tend to collect around disloca-
tions. This segregation of impurity atoms cannot normally occur in a reasonable length of
time at low temperatures because the atoms of the solid do not diffuse or move fast enough
at low temperatures to let them collect around dislocations. However, at higher tempera-
tures the movement of impurity atoms to dislocations can occur quite rapidly. Thus, dislo-
cations formed at high temperatures are more likely to have impurity atoms segregated
around them than dislocations created in the lattice at room temperature. This ability of an
etching solution to distinguish between the grown-in and newly formed dislocations is one
of the distinct advantages offered by the use of LiF in studying nucleation phenomena.
Another interesting facet to the use of etch pits-in observing dislocations in LiF is that
with the proper technique one can follow the movement of a dislocation under the action
of an applied stress. This usually requires several repetitions of the etching process. Thus,
the surface of a specimen is ﬁrst etched to reveal the positions of the dislocations at a given
time. The pits that form are usually observed on {001} surfaces: LiF crystals are easily split
along {001} planes. On this type of surface, the pits form as four-sided pyramids with a
sharp point at their lower extremity. If a stress is applied to the specimen now, the dislo-
cations will move away from their pits. A second etch will both reveal the new positions
of the dislocations and enlarge the old pits representing the original positions. The two sets
of pits have a distinct difference in appearance, however. The pits actually connected with
the dislocation always have pointed extremities, while those from which the dislocations
have moved have ﬂat bottoms. See Fig. 5.4.
Johnston and Gilman took advantage of their technique for following the movement
of a dislocation in LiF, and were able to measure the velocity of a dislocation moving under
a ﬁxed applied stress. They simply divided the distance that a dislocation moved by the
time that the stress pulse was applied to the crystal containing the dislocation. This subject
will be discussed further in Section 5.21.
The work on lithium ﬂuoride has shown that, in this particular material, the grown-
in dislocations are usually ﬁrmly anchored in place and do not take part in the plastic
deformation processes. The immobility of network dislocations can be credited to the
presence of atmospheres of impurity atoms that segregate around each dislocation. This
subject is considered in more detail in Chapter 9.

LiF crystals without homogeneously nucleating dislocations. For example, when a small,
carefully cleaned sphere (made of glass) is pressed on a dislocation-free region of the sur-
face of a LiF crystal, it is possible to attain shear stresses estimated to be as large as 760 MPa,
and still not create dislocations. This stress, it is to be noted, is more than 100 times larger
than the stress normally required to cause yielding in this material. It is further believed that
even this high stress, which was limited by experimental difﬁculties caused by breaking the
glass ball, does not deﬁne the stress required to homogeneously nucleate dislocations in LiF.
At any rate, it is clear that nucleation of dislocations by an unaided stress is very difﬁcult.
Because the yield stress, or the stress at which dislocations normally start to move, is much
lower than that required to homogeneously nucleate dislocations, it is clear that the major-
ity of dislocations must be nucleated heterogeneously. Gilman concludes6that in LiF small
foreign heterogeneities cause most of the dislocation nucleation. The most important of
these are probably small impurity particles. Experimental evidence6for the formation of
dislocations at inclusions in LiF crystals has actually been attained.
5.3 BEND GLIDING
It has been known for a good many years that crystals can be plastically bent and that this
form of plastic deformation occurs as a result of slip. The bending of crystals can be
explained in terms of Frank-Read or other sources.
Let equal couples (of magnitude M) be applied to the ends of the crystal shown in
Fig. 5.5. The effect of these couples is to produce a uniform bending moment ( M) through-
out the length of the crystal. Until the yield point of the crystal is exceeded, the deforma-
tion will be elastic. The stress distribution across any cross-section, such as aa, is given by
the equation

shows the stress distribution, which varies uniformly from a maximum compressive
stress at the upper surface, to zero at the neutral axis, and then to a maximum tensile
stress at the lower surface. Figure 5.6 represents the same crystal in which the line mnis
assumed to represent the trace of a slip plane. The curvature of the crystal is not shown
in order to simplify the ﬁgure. For convenience, it is further assumed that the slip plane
is perpendicular to the plane of the paper and that the line mnis also the slip direction.
The horizontal vectors associated with line mnrepresent the same stress distribution as
that of Fig. 5.5B. Figure 5.6 also shows, along line op, the shear-stress component (par-
allel to the slip plane) of the stress distribution. Notice that the sense of the shear stress
changes its sign as it crosses the neutral axis. Furthermore, the shear stress is zero at the
neutral axis and a maximum at the extreme ends of the slip plane. Because of the shear-
stress distribution, the ﬁrst dislocation loops will form at Frank-Read or other sources
close to either the upper or lower surface. The manner in which these dislocation loops
move, however, depends on whether the dislocation lies above or below the neutral axis
of the specimen. In both cases, the positive edge components of all dislocation loops
move toward the surface, while the negative edge components move toward the
specimen’s neutral axis. (See Fig. 5.7). The negative edge dislocations move toward a
region of decreasing shear stress and must eventually stop. The positive edge disloca-
tions, on the other hand, are in a region of high stress, as are the right- and left-hand
screw components of each dislocation loop, which move under the applied stress in a
direction either into or out of the paper. All three of these last components (positive
edge and right- and left-hand screws) can be assumed to move to the surface and05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 124
125 5.4 Rotational Slip
leave the crystal. For example, under the applied bending-stress distribution, closed
dislocation loops originating at Frank-Read sources eventually become negative-edge
dislocations that move toward the neutral axis of the crystal. As the crystal is bent fur-
ther and further, the negative-edge dislocations will be driven further and further along
the slip planes toward the center of the crystal. Eventually an orderly sequence of dis-
locations will be found on each active slip plane, with the dislocations having a more or
less uniform separation, the minimum spacing of which is dependent on the fact that
dislocations of the same type and same sign mutually repel if they lie on the same slip
plane. Figure 5.8 illustrates the general nature of the dislocation distribution. The
narrow section surrounding the neutral axis is presented free of dislocations, in agree-
ment with the fact that this region, under moderate bending stresses, will not be stressed
above the elastic limit, and the deformation will be elastic and not plastic.
Now each negative-edge dislocation of a sequence lying on a given slip plane
represents an extra plane that ends at the slip plane. Each of these extra planes lies
on the left of its slip plane. In order to accommodate these extra planes (all on one
side of a given slip plane), the slip planes must assume a curvature that is convex
downward and to the left, and the crystal as a whole assumes a convex curvature
downward.
If the couples applied to the crystal in Figs. 5.5 to 5.8 were reversed, an excess of pos-
itive dislocations would develop along the slip planes. The slip planes and the crystal
would then assume a curvature the reverse of that described above.
In the preceding discussion, the crystal was assumed to be of macroscopic dimensions
and the bending deformation was assumed to be uniformly distributed over the length of
the crystal. The phenomenon that has been described is not, however, restricted to large
crystals. Bending of crystal planes through accumulation of an excess number of edge dis-
locations of the same sign may occur in quite small crystals, or even in extremely small
areas of crystals. A number of related phenomena that have been observed in metal crys-
tals can be explained in terms of localized lattice rotations. In each case, there is an accu-
mulation of edge dislocations of the same sign upon slip planes of the crystal. Among these
are kinks, bend planes, and deformation bands. A detailed description of the latter is beyond
the scope of the present text, but the fact that they are frequently observed emphasizes the
fact that plastic bending of metal crystals is an important deformation mechanism.
5.4 ROTATIONAL SLIP
Thus far we have seen that dislocations are capable of producing simple shear (as in
Fig. 4.12) and bending (as in Fig. 5.8). A third type of deformation that can be devel-
oped by dislocations is shown in Fig. 5.9. In this sketch, the crystal is assumed to be a
cylinder with an active slip plane perpendicular to its axis. As may be seen in the draw-
ing, the top half of the crystal has been rotated clockwise relative to the bottom half.M M

Axis Axis 
Slip planeFIG. 5.9 A single crystal can be rotated about
an axis normal to a slip plane that contains
several slip directions
This is indicated by the horizontal displacement of the line abcd between the points b
and c. This type of deformation therefore corresponds to a rotation of a crystal on its
slip plane about an axis normal to the slip plane. Torsional deformation such as this can
be explained in terms of screw dislocations lying on the slip plane. However, unlike the
case of bending, more than one set of dislocations is required. This, in turn, signiﬁes
that the slip plane must contain more than one possible slip direction. The basal plane
in a hexagonal close-packed metal and the {111} planes in face-centered cubic metals,
with their three slip directions, are almost ideal for producing this type of deformation.
The need for more than one set of screw dislocations in order to explain rotational slip
can be seen with the aid of Figs. 5.10 and 5.11. These diagrams are drawn in a manner
similar to Figs. 4.18 and 4.19 and therefore correspond to a view looking down from above
on the slip plane in a simple cubic lattice. As before, open circles represent atoms just
above the slip plane, while dots correspond to atoms just below it. Figure 5.10 corresponds
to a single array of (horizontal) parallel screw dislocations. As may be seen in the illustra-
tion, such a dislocation arrangement shears the material above the slip plane relative to
that below it only in the horizontal direction. For a true rotation one needs a similar com-
ponent of shear at 90° to this direction. A simple double array of screw dislocations is
shown in Fig. 5.11. This gives the desired rotational deformation. Further, it should be
noted that the two arrays of screw dislocations at 90° to each other have strain ﬁelds that
tend to compensate each other, either above or below the slip plane. As a result, the strain
ﬁeld of the double array tends to be very small at any reasonable distance from the slip
plane; and the array, therefore, corresponds to one of low strain energy. This is not true,
however, of a single array, as shown in Fig. 5.10. Here the strain ﬁelds of the individual
parallel dislocations are additive and the array is not one of low energy.
While rotational slip has not been extensively studied, it does represent a basic way in
which a crystal can be deformed. The amount of slip deformation one can obtain by this05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 126

mechanism can be very large. In fact, it is possible to twist a 1 cm diameter zinc crystal
about its basal plane pole through as many as 10 or more revolutions per inch. This defor-
mation, of course, occurs on many slip planes distributed over the gage section and not on
one plane, as shown in Fig. 5.9.
5.5 SLIP PLANES AND SLIP DIRECTIONS
It is an experimental fact that in metal crystals slip, or glide, occurs preferentially on planes
of high-atomic density. It is a general rule that the separation between parallel lattice
planes varies directly as the degree of packing in the planes. Therefore, crystals are sheared
most easily on planes of wide separation. This statement does not mean that slip cannot
occur in a given crystal on planes other than the most closely packed plane. Rather, it
means that dislocations move more easily along planes of wide spacing where the lattice
distortion due to the movement of the dislocation is small.
Not only does slip tend to take place on preferred crystallographic planes, but the direc-
tion of shear associated with slip is also crystallographic. The slip direction of a crystal (shear05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 127

direction) has been found to be almost exclusively a close-packed direction, a lattice direc-
tion with atoms arranged in a straight line, one touching the next. This tendency for slip to
occur along close-packed directions is much stronger than the tendency for slip to occur on
the most closely packed plane. For practical purposes, it can usually be assumed that slip
occurs in a close-packed direction.
The fact that the experimentally determined slip direction coincides with the close-
packed directions of a crystal can be explained in terms of dislocations. When a dislocation
moves through a crystal, the crystal is sheared by an amount equal to the Burgers vector
of the dislocation. After the dislocation has passed, the crystal must be unchanged in the
geometry of the atoms; that is, the symmetry of the crystal must be retained. The smallest
shear that can fulﬁll this condition equals the distance between atoms in a close-packed
direction.
In order to explain this point more clearly, let us consider a hard-ball model of a sim-
ple cubic crystal structure. Line mnof Fig. 5.12A is a close-packed direction. In Fig. 5.12B
the upper half of the lattice has been sheared to the right by a, the distance between atoms05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 128

the lattice symmetry: (A)Crystal before shearing, (B)shear in a close-packed direction, and
(C)shear in a non-close-packed direction
in the direction mn. The shear, of course, has not changed the crystal structure. Consider
now an arbitrarily chosen nonclose-packed direction such as qrin Fig. 5.12A. Figure 5.12C
shows that a shear of c(the distance between atom centers in this direction) also preserves
the lattice. However, cis larger than a(c/H110051.414 a). Furthermore, cand aequal the respec-
tive sizes of the Burgers vectors of the dislocation capable of producing the two shears. The
dislocation corresponding to the shear in the close-packed direction thus has the smallest
Burgers vector. However, the lattice distortion and strain energy associated with a disloca-
tion are functions of the size of the Burgers vector, and it has been shown by Frank that
the strain energy varies directly as the square of the Burgers vector.
In the present case, the strain energy of a dislocation of Burgers vector cis twice that
of a dislocation of Burgers vector a(that is, c2/H11005(1.414)2a2). Thus, a dislocation with a
Burgers vector equal to the spacing of atoms in a close-packed direction would be unique.
It possesses the smallest strain energy of all dislocations whose movement through the
crystal does not disturb the crystal structure. The fact that it possesses the least strain
energy should make this form of dislocation much more probable than forms of higher
strain energy. It should also account for the experimentally observed fact that the slip
direction in crystals is almost always a close-packed direction.
5.6 SLIP SYSTEMS
The combination of a slip plane and one of its close-packed directions deﬁnes a possible slip
mode or slip system . If the plane of the paper in Fig. 5.13 is considered to deﬁne a slip plane,
then there will be three slip systems associated with the indicated close-packed plane, one
mode corresponding to each of the three slip directions. All of the modes of a given slip
plane are crystallographically equivalent. Further, all slip systems in planes of the same form
[(111), (1 1), ( 11), and (11 )] are also equivalent. However, the ease with which slip can
be produced on slip systems belonging to planes of different forms [(111) and (110)] will,
in general, be greatly different.
5.7 CRITICAL RESOLVED SHEAR STRESS
It is a well-known fact that polycrystalline metal specimens possess a yield stress that
must be exceeded in order to produce plastic deformation. It is also true that metal sin-
gle crystals need to be stressed above a similar yield point before plastic deformation by
slip becomes macroscopically measurable. Since slip is caused by shear stresses, the yield1 1 105Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 129

FIG. 5.14 A ﬁgure for the determination of

stress for crystals is best expressed in terms of a shear stress resolved on the slip plane and
in the slip direction. This stress is called the critical resolved shear stress . It is the stress that
will cause sufﬁciently large numbers of dislocations to move so that a measurable strain
can be observed. Most crystal specimens are not tested directly in shear, but in tension.
There are good reasons for this. The most important reason is that it is almost impossible
to test a crystal in direct shear without introducing bending moments where the speci-
men is gripped. The effect of these bending moments is to produce shear stress compo-
nents on slip planes other than the one on which it is desired to study slip. If slip on
these planes is not measurably more difﬁcult than on the plane to be tested, one obtains
a condition where slip occurs on several slip planes over those parts of the specimen near
the grips. The effect of this deformation may be to cause bending of the specimen near the
grips, and one is thus left with a deformation that is far from homogeneous. There are
also problems associated with the use of single crystal tensile specimens, but these are less
serious and, by proper design of the grips, they may be largely eliminated.
An equation will now be derived that relates the applied tensile stress to the shear
stress resolved on the slip plane and in the slip direction.
Let the inclined plane at the top of the cylindrical crystal in Fig. 5.14 correspond to the
slip plane of the crystal. The normal to the slip plane and the slip direction are indicated
by the lines pand d, respectively. The angle between the slip plane normal and the stress
axis is represented by u, and that between the slip direction and the stress axis by f. The
axial tensile force applied to the crystal is designated by fn.
The cross-section area of the specimen perpendicular to the applied tensile force is
to the area of the slip plane as the cosine of the angle between the two planes. This angle05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 130
131 5.7 Critical Resolved Shear Stress
is the same as the angle between the normals to the two planes in question and is the
angle uin the ﬁgure. Thus,
5.2
or
where Anis the cross-section area perpendicular to the specimen axis, and Aspthe area of
the slip plane. The stress on the slip plane equals the applied force divided by the area of
the slip plane:
where sAis the stress on the slip plane in the direction of the original force fn. This is not,
however, the shear stress that acts in the slip direction, but the total stress acting on the
slip plane. The component of this stress parallel to the slip direction is the desired shearstress and may be obtained by multiplying s
Aby cos f, where fis the angle between sA
and τthe resolved shear stress. As a result of the above, we can now write
where τis the shear stress resolved on the slip plane and in the slip direction. Finally, since
fn/Anis the applied tensile force divided by the area normal to this force, this term may be
replaced by sthe normal tensile stress:
τ/H11005scos ucos f 5.3
Several important conclusions may be drawn from the Eq. 5.3. If the tensile axis is
perpendicular to the slip plane, the angle fis 90° and the shear stress is zero. Similarly,
if the stress axis lies in the slip plane, the angle uis 90° and the shear stress is again zero.
Thus, it is not possible to produce slip on a given plane when the plane is either paral-lel or perpendicular to the axis of tensile stress. The maximum shear stress that can bedeveloped equals 0.5 sand occurs when both uand fequal 45°. For all other combi-
nations of these two angles, the resolved shear stress is smaller than one-half the tensilestress.
In regard to Eq. 5.3, it is important to note that the resolved shear stress τdue to a
tensile stress sdepends on the cosines of the angles between two pairs of directions; that
is, the cosine of the angle ubetween the tensile stress axis and the slip plane pole and the
cosine of the angle fbetween the tensile stress axis and the slip direction. Assuming that
one has a cubic crystal and the direction indices for these three directions are known, onecan can easily compute these cosines with the aid of the following equation:

where h1, k1, and l1are the direction indices of one of the directions and h2, k2, and l2are

angle between the [121] and [30 ] directions. In this case we have
or cos f/H110050.258 and f/H1100575.04°.
It has been experimentally veriﬁed that the critical resolved shear stress for a given
crystallographic plane is independent of the orientation of the crystal for some metals.
Thus, if a number of crystals, differing only in the orientation of the slip plane to the axis
of tensile stress, are pulled in tension, and the shear stress at which they yield is computed
with the above equation, it will be found that the yield stress is a constant. Figure 5.15
shows the critical resolved shear-stress data of Burke and Hibbard for magnesium single
crystals of 99.99 percent purity. The ordinate of this curve is the tensile stress at which
yielding was observed, while the abscissae give corresponding values of the function cos u
cos f. A smooth curve is plotted through the data corresponding to a constant yield stress
(shear stress) of 0.43 MPa. The experimental points fall on this curve with remarkable
accuracy. Some work8–10on bcc metals has indicated that, in these metals, the critical
resolved shear stress may be a function of orientation as well as of the type of stress.
In other words, the yield stress for this type of crystal can be different depending upon
whether the applied stress is tensile or compressive.
In some metals the critical resolved shear stress for slip on a given type of plane is
remarkably constant for crystals of the same composition and previous treatment.
However, the critical resolved shear stress is sensitive to changes in composition and han-
dling. In general, the purer the metal the lower the yield stress, as may be seen quite
clearly from the curves of Fig. 5.16 for silver and copper single crystals. The silver data in
particular show that changing the composition from a purity of 99.999 to 99.93 percent
raises the critical resolved shear stress by a factor of more than three.
The critical resolved shear stress is a function of temperature. In the case of face-
centered cubic crystals, this temperature dependence may be small. Metal crystals belong-
ing to other crystal forms (body-centered cubic, hexagonal, and rhombohedral) show a
larger temperature effect. The yield stress in these crystals increases as the temperature is
lowered, with the rate of increase generally becoming greater as the temperature drops.cos f/H110051/H110803/H110012/H110800/H110021/H110801

5.8 SLIP ON EQUIVALENT SLIP SYSTEMS
It has been empirically determined that when a crystal possesses several crystallographi-
cally equivalent slip systems, slip will start ﬁrst on the system having the highest resolved
shear stress. It has also been found that if several equivalent systems are equally stressed,
slip will usually commence simultaneously on all of these systems.
5.9 THE DISLOCATION DENSITY
Even in a deformed single crystal, only a small fraction of the dislocations formed during
deformation come to the surface and are lost. This means that with continued straining,
the number of dislocations in a metal increases. As will be shown later, this increase in the
number of retained dislocations results in a strengthening of the metal. In other words, the
increase in hardness or strength of a metal with deformation is closely associated with an
increase in the concentration of the dislocations. The parameter commonly used to express
this quantity is r, the dislocation density, which is deﬁned as the total length of all the dis-
location lines in a unit volume. Its dimensions are thus cm/cm3or cm/H110022.
The dislocation density is often determined by estimating the length of the dislo-
cation line visible in a transmission electron microscope photograph of a metal foil
specimen of known thickness after making corrections for the magnification of the
microscope. An alternate procedure is to measure the number of dislocation etch pits
visible on a suitably etched specimen surface. In this case the dislocation density
is given as the number of pits per cm2, that is, r/H11005N/cm2, where Nis the number
of pits.
5.10 SLIP SYSTEMS IN DIFFERENT CRYSTAL FORMS
Face-Centered Cubic Metals The close-packed directions are the /H20855110/H20856
directions in the face-centered cubic structure. These are directions that run diagonally
across the faces of the unit cell. Figure 5.13 shows a segment of a plane of closest packing.
There are four of these planes in the face-centered cubic lattice, called octahedral planes ,
with indices (111), (1 1), (11 ), and ( 11). Each octahedral plane contains three close-
packed directions, as can be seen in Fig. 5.13, and, therefore, the total number of octahe-
dral slip systems is 4 /H110033/H1100512. The number of octahedral slip systems can also be1 1 105Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 133
Chapter 5 Dislocations and Plastic Deformation 134
computed in a different manner. There are 6 /H20855110/H20856directions, and since each close-packed
direction lies in two octahedral planes, the number of slip systems is therefore 12.
The only important slip systems in the face-centered cubic structure are those associ-
ated with slip on the octahedral plane. There are several reasons for this. First, slip can
occur much more easily on a plane of closest packing than on planes of lower atomic den-sity; that is, the critical resolved shear stress for octahedral slip is lower than for otherforms. Second, there are twelve different ways that octahedral slip can occur, and thetwelve slip systems are well distributed in space. It is, therefore, almost impossible to straina face-centered cubic crystal and not have at least one {111} plane in a favorable positionfor slip.
Table 5.1 lists the critical resolved shear stress, measured at room temperature, for sev-
eral important face-centered cubic metals. Table 5.1 clearly shows that the critical resolvedshear stresses of face-centered cubic metals in the nearly pure state are very small.
In general, plastically deformed face-centered cubic crystals slip on more than one octa-
hedral plane because of the large number of equivalent slip systems. In fact, even in a sim-ple tensile test it is very difﬁcult to produce strains of over a few percent without inducingglide simultaneously on several planes. However, when slip occurs at the same time on sev-eral intersecting slip planes, the stress required to produce additional deformation rises rap-idly. In other words, the crystal strain hardens. Figure 5.17 shows typical tensile stress-straincurves for a pair of face-centered cubic crystals. Curve acorresponds to a crystal whose orig-
inal orientation lies close to /H20855100/H20856. In this crystal several slip systems have nearly equal
resolved shear stresses. As a consequence, plastic deformation occurs by slip on several slipplanes and the curve has a steep slope from the beginning of the deformation. On the otherhand, curve bcorresponds to a crystal whose orientation falls in the center of the stereo-
graphic triangle and is representative of crystals in which one slip plane is more highlystressed than all the others at the start of deformation. The region marked 1 of this curvecorresponds to slip on this plane only; the other slip planes are inactive. The small slope ofthe curve in stage 1 shows that the strain hardening is minor when slip occurs on a singlecrystallographic plane. Stage 2 of curve b, which appears after strains of several percent, has
a much steeper slope, and the crystal hardens rapidly with increasing strain. In this region,slip on a single plane ceases, and multiple glide on intersecting slip planes begins. Here the

(easy glide). Crystal orientations are shown in the stereographic triangle
dislocation density grows rapidly with increasing strain. Finally, stage 3 represents a region
where the rate of strain hardening progressively decreases. In this region, the rate of
increase of the dislocation density becomes smaller with increasing strain.
Region 1 of curve b, where slip occurs on a single plane, is called the region of easy
glide. The extent of the region of easy glide depends on several factors, among which are
size of specimen and purity of the metal. When the cross-section diameter of a crystal spec-
imen is large, or the metal very pure, the region of easy glide tends to disappear. In any
case, the region of easy glide, or single slip, rarely exceeds strains of several percent in face-
centered cubic crystals, and, for all practical purposes, it can be assumed that these metals
deform by multiple glide on a number of octahedral systems. This deformation is especially
true in the case of polycrystalline face-centered cubic metals.
The plastic properties of pure face-centered cubic metals are as follows. Low critical
resolved shear stresses for slip on octahedral planes signiﬁes that plastic deformation of
these metals starts at low stress levels. Multiple slip on intersecting slip planes, however,
causes rapid strain hardening as deformation proceeds.
Hexagonal Metals Since the basal plane of the close-packed hexagonal crystal
and the octahedral {111} plane of the face-centered cubic lattice have identical arrange-
ments of atoms, it would be expected that slip on the basal plane of hexagonal metals
would occur as easily as slip on the octahedral planes of face-centered cubic metals. In the
case of the three hexagonal metals, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium, this is actually
the case. Table 5.2 lists the critical resolved shear stress for basal slip of these metals as05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 135

measured at room temperature. The hexagonal Miller indices of the basal plane are
(0001), and the close-packed, or slip, directions are /H2085511 0 /H20856.
Table 5.2 deﬁnitely conﬁrms that plastic deformation by basal slip in these three
hexagonal metals begins at stresses of the same order of magnitude as those required tostart slip in face-centered cubic metals.
Two other hexagonal metals of interest are titanium and beryllium, in which the
room-temperature critical resolved shear stress for basal slip is very high (approximately110 MPa in the case of titanium,
11and 39 MPa for beryllium12). Furthermore, it has been
established that in titanium the critical resolved shear stress for slip on {10 0} prism planesin /H2085511 0 /H20856close-packed directions is about 49 MPa.
11The latter plane is therefore the pre-
ferred slip plane in titanium. The basal slip of zirconium, still another hexagonal metal, hasthus far not been observed. It appears that slip occurs primarily on {10 0} /H2085511 0 /H20856slip sys-
tems. The critical resolved shear stress for this form of slip is about 6.2 MPa.
13The ques-
tion is how the differences in the slip behavior of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium on theone hand, and beryllium, titanium, and zirconium on the other, can be explained. A com-plete solution to this problem is not at hand, but the following is undoubtedly related tothis effect.

distance aequals the distance between atoms in the basal plane, while cis the vertical dis-
tance between atoms in every other basal plane. The ratio c/ais, therefore, a dimension-
less measure of the spacing between basal planes. If the atoms of hexagonal metals weretruly spherical in shape, the ratio c/awould be the same in all cases (1.632). Table 5.3
shows, however, that this value is not the same, but that it varies from 1.886 in the caseof cadmium to 1.586 in the case of beryllium. Only magnesium has an atom thatapproaches a true spherical shape, c/a/H110051.624. Cadmium and zinc have a basal-plane sep-
aration greater than that of packed spheres, while beryllium, titanium, and zirconiumhave a smaller one. It is signiﬁcant that the hexagonal metals with small separationsbetween basal planes are those with very high critical resolved shear stresses for basal slip.
The hexagonal metals zinc and cadmium have been observed to slip on a unique slip
system when deformed in such a manner as to make the resolved shear stress on the basalplane very small. This deformation can be accomplished, for example, by placing the ten-sile stress axis nearly parallel to the basal plane. The observed slip plane for this type ofdeformation is {11 2}, while the slip direction is /H2085511 /H20856. Figure 5.18 shows the position
of one of these slip planes and one of these slip directions in a hexagonal unit cell. Thesigniﬁcant characteristic of this mode or deformation is that the /H2085511 /H20856direction is not

the closest packed direction in the hexagonal crystal structure. Prior to the observation
of {11 2} /H2085511 /H20856slip, the slip direction in all metals had been almost universally observed
as the direction of closest packing. This second-order pyramidal glide was ﬁrst observed by
Bell and Cahn14on macroscopic zinc crystals, but it has also been veriﬁed in both zinc and
cadmium by Price,15,16who used the transmission electron microscope. The work of
Price has not only conﬁrmed the existence of this kind of slip, but has actually shown the
dislocations responsible for it. For photographs of these dislocations, one is referred to the
original publications.15,16
Easy Glide in Hexagonal Metals The metals zinc, cadmium, and magne-
sium are unique in that they possess both a low critical resolved shear stress and a single
primary slip plane, the basal plane. Provided that this slip plane is suitably oriented with
respect to the stress axis, strains of very large magnitude can be developed by basal slip.
Simultaneous slip on intersecting primary slip planes is not a problem in these metals with
a single slip plane, and the rate of strain hardening is therefore much smaller than in face-
centered cubic crystals. The region of easy glide in a tensile stress-strain curve, instead of
extending only several percent, may exceed values of 100 percent. In fact, it is quite pos-
sible to stretch a magnesium crystal ribbonlike four to six times its original length.32 2TABLE 5.3 The c/aRatio

Chapter 5 Dislocations and Plastic Deformation 138
The very large plasticity of single crystals of these three hexagonal metals does not
carry over to their polycrystalline form. Polycrystalline magnesium, zinc, or cadmium have
low ductilities. In the previous paragraph it was pointed out that the large ductility of the
single crystals is due to the fact that slip occurs on a single crystallographic plane. However,
in polycrystalline material, plastic deformation is much more complicated than it is in sin-
gle crystals. Each crystal must undergo a deformation that allows it to conform to the
changes in the shape of its neighbors. Crystals with only a single slip plane do not have
enough plastic degrees of freedom for extensive deformation under the conditions that
occur in polycrystalline metals.
Body-Centered Cubic Crystals The body-centered cubic crystal is char-
acterized by four close-packed directions, the /H20855111/H20856directions, and by the lack of a truly
close-packed plane such as the octahedral plane of the face-centered cubic lattice, or the
basal plane of the hexagonal lattice. Figure 5.19 shows a hard-ball model of the body-
centered cubic (110) plane, the most closely packed plane in this lattice. Two close-
packed directions lie in this plane, the [ 11] and the [1 1].
The slip phenomena observed on body-centered cubic crystals corresponds closely
to that expected in crystals with close-packed directions and no truly close-packed
plane. The slip direction in the body-centered cubic crystals is the close-packed direc-
tion, /H20855111 /H20856; the slip plane, however, is not well defined. Body-centered cubic slip lines
are wavy and irregular, often making the identification of a slip plane extremely dif-
ficult. The {110}, {112}, and {123} planes have all been identified as slip planes in
body-centered cubic crystals, but work on iron single crystals indicates that any plane
that contains a close-packed /H20855111 /H20856direction can act as a slip plane. In further agree-
ment with the lack of a close-packed plane is the high critical resolved shear stress for
slip in body-centered cubic metals. In iron it is approximately 28 MPa at room
temperature.
5.11 CROSS-SLIP
Cross-slip is a phenomenon that can occur in crystals when there are two or more slip
planes with a common slip direction. As an example, take the hexagonal metal magne-
sium in which, at low temperatures, slip can occur either on the basal plane or on {10 0}
prism planes. These two types of planes have common slip directions—the close-packed
/H2085511 0 /H20856directions. The relative orientations of the basal plane and one prism plane are
shown in Fig. 5.20A and 5.20B, where each diagram is supposed to represent a crystal in211 1[111]– [111]– FIG. 5.19 The (110) plane of the body-

the same basic orientation (basal plane parallel to the top and bottom surfaces). In the ﬁrst
sketch, the crystal is sheared on the basal plane, while in the second it is sheared on the
prism plane. The third illustration, Fig. 5.20C, shows the nature of cross-slip. Here it is
observed that the actual slip surface is not a single plane, but is made up of segments, part
of which lie in the basal plane and part in the prism plane. The resulting proﬁle of the slip
surface has the appearance of a staircase. A simple analogy for cross-slip is furnished by
a drawer in a piece of furniture. The sliding of the sides and bottom of the drawer
relative to the frame of the piece is basically similar to the shearing motion that results
from cross-slip.
A photograph of a magnesium crystal showing cross-slip is given in Fig. 5.21,
where the plane of the photograph is equivalent to the forward faces of the schematic
crystals shown in Fig. 5.20. Notice that while the slip in this specimen has occurred
primarily along a prism plane, cross-slip segments on the basal plane are clearly
evident.
During cross-slip the dislocations producing the deformation must, of necessity,
shift from one slip plane to the other. In the example given above, the dislocations
move from prism plane to basal plane and back to prism plane. The actual shift of the
dislocation from one plane to another can only occur for a dislocation in the screw
orientation. Edge dislocations, as was pointed out earlier, have their Burgers vector
normal to their dislocation lines. Since the active slip plane must contain both the
Burgers vector and the dislocation line, edge dislocations are confined to move in a
single slip plane. Screw dislocations, with their Burgers vectors parallel to the dislo-
cation lines, are capable of moving in any plane that passes through the dislocation
line. The manner in which a screw dislocation can produce a step in a slip plane is
shown schematically in Fig. 5.22.05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 139

141 5.13 Double Cross-Slip
5.12 SLIP BANDS
A slip band is a group of closely spaced slip lines that appears, at low magnification,
to be a single large slip line. In many metals slip bands tend to be wavy and irregu-
lar in appearance; this is evidence that the dislocations that produce the bands in
these metals are not so confined as to move in a single plane. The shifting of the
dislocations from one slip plane to another is usually the result of the cross-slip of
screw dislocations.
The resolution of the individual slip lines in a slip band is normally a task requir-
ing the use of an electron microscope. However, when a slip band is observed on a
surface that is nearly parallel to the active slip plane, it is sometimes possible to par-
tially resolve the components of a slip band with a light microscope. An example of slip
markings and the corresponding dislocation arrays after deformation of gold is shown
in Fig. 5.23.
5.13 DOUBLE CROSS-SLIP
Another very important aspect of the work done on LiF crystals17is that it has shown
that moving dislocations can multiply. The mechanism that seems most adequately
to explain this dislocation multiplication is double cross-slip . As mentioned in Sec. 5.2,
dislocations in LiF appear to nucleate at impurity particles. The slip process that
develops from these nucleated dislocations first forms narrow slip planes that grow
into slip bands of finite width with continued straining. These slip bands, in turn, can
expand so as effectively to cover the complete crystal. Several rather narrow bands,
as well as some that have grown to a moderate width, may be seen in the photograph
of Fig. 5.24. Note that the presence of the slip bands is revealed by the rows or
etch pits.
The development of the double cross-slip mechanism, which was originally proposed
by Koehler18and later by Orowan,19is shown in Fig. 5.25. In sketch (A), a dislocation

loop is assumed to be expanding on the primary slip plane. In part (B), a segment of the
dislocation loop that is in the screw orientation is shown cross-slipping onto the cross-slipplane. Finally, in (C), the dislocation moves back into a plane parallel to its original slipplane. Attention is now called to the similarity of the dislocation conﬁguration, startingat point band ending at point c, to the Frank-Read source conﬁguration shown in
Fig. 5.1. This is, in fact, a classical dislocation generator, and dislocations can be createdwith it on the new slip plane. It is also true that this dislocation conﬁguration can also actas a Frank-Read source in the slip plane of the original loop. Proof of this last statementis left as an exercise.
An important feature of the double cross-slip mechanism is that Frank-Read sources
associated with this mechanism involve freshly created dislocations; that is, dislocationswhich, in general, will not have had time enough to become pinned by impurity atoms.The operation of a Frank-Read source with this type of dislocation is much more probablethan that involving grown-in dislocations.
5.14 EXTENDED DISLOCATIONS AND CROSS-SLIP
While a total /H20855110 /H20856dislocation in a fcc metal can readily cross-slip between a pair of
octahedral planes, this is not true of an extended dislocation. The reason for this isshown in the diagrams of Fig. 5.26. In part (A) of this illustration, a total /H2085510/H20856dis-
location is shown cross-slipping from the primary slip plane (111) to the cross-slipplane (11 ). Note that the Burgers vector of this dislocation lies along a direction com-mon to both slip planes. In part (B) of this diagram, a corresponding extended dislo-cation is shown moving downward on the (111) primary slip plane. Assume, as shownin Fig. 5.26C, that the leading partial dislocation of this extended dislocation movesoff on the cross-slip plane. Since the Burgers vector of this partial dislocation is [ 11]and this vector has a direction that does not lie in the (11 ) cross-slip plane, a dislo-cation reaction has to occur that results in the creation of two new dislocations. Thisreaction is
[ 11] :[ 21] /H11001[0 ] 5.5
One of these dislocations is a Shockley partial that is free to move on the cross-slip planeand has a Burgers vector [ 21]. The other is immobile (sessile) and remains behindalong the line of intersection between the primary and cross-slip planes. This latterdislocation is called a stair-rod dislocation, and its Burgers vector is [ 0]. Stair-rod
dislocations, of which the present example represents only one of a number of differenttypes, are always found when a stacking fault runs from one slip plane over into another,as shown in Fig. 5.26C. Note that the [1 0] of the stair-rod dislocation in Fig. 5.26C isperpendicular to the line of intersection of the two slip planes and that it also does not liein either slip plane.
In the cross-slip of an extended dislocation, the stair-rod dislocation is removed
when the trailing partial dislocation arrives at the line of intersection of the twoslip planes and then moves off on the cross-slip plane, as shown by the followingequation:
[2] /H11001[0 ] /H11005[1] 5.6
This reaction is illustrated in Fig. 5.26C.121

Chapter 5 Dislocations and Plastic Deformation 144
Since additional strain energy is required to create the stair-rod dislocation associated
with the cross-slip of an extended dislocation, it should be much easier for a total disloca-
tion than for an extended dislocation to cross-slip.
5.15 CRYSTAL STRUCTURE ROTATION DURING TENSILE
AND COMPRESSIVE DEFORMATION
When a single crystal is deformed in either tension or compression, the crystal lattice
usually suffers a rotation, as indicated schematically in Fig. 5.27. In tension, this tends
to align the slip plane and the active slip direction parallel to the tensile stress axis. It is
often possible to identify the active slip plane and slip direction as a result of this
rotation. Thus, suppose that, before it is deformed, an fcc crystal has the orientation
marked a1shown in the standard projection of Fig. 5.28. If it is now strained by a small
amount and its orientation is redetermined by a Laue back-reﬂection photograph, the
stress axis should plot (in the standard stereographic projection) at a new position suchPrimary

FIG. 5.29 The original stress axis orientation in Fig. 5.28 lies about 45°
from the pole of the (111) plane and about 90° from the pole of (111).
These are the two slip planes that contain the active slip directionas a2. A second similar deformation should produce a third stress axis orientation at a3.
These three stress axis positions will normally fall along a great circle and, if this great
circle is projected ahead, it should pass through the active slip direction. In the present
case, as may be seen in Fig. 5.28, the slip direction is [10 ]. As shown in Fig. 5.29, this
slip direction lies in both the (111) and the (1 1) planes. Since the (111) pole makes
an angle of nearly 45° with the stress axis, while the (1 1) pole makes a corresponding
angle closer to 90°, one can deduce that the resolved shear stress should be larger on
the former. This means that the active slip plane should be (111). Normally it should
also be possible to verify this fact by measuring the orientation of the slip line traces on
the specimen surface.
Note that in the example of Fig. 5.28 the active slip direction is the closest /H20855110/H20856direc-
tion to the stress axis that can be reached by crossing a boundary of the stereographic
triangle that contains the stress axis. This fact can be considered to deﬁne a general rule that
is applicable to the tensile deformation of fcc crystals. As an added example, consider the
possible stress axis orientation, marked b, lying in the stereographic triangle at the left of the
ﬁgure and near the (0 0) pole. Following the above rule, the slip direction should be [0 1].
The corresponding slip plane pole should be (1 ). Once the slip direction has been
obtained, the pole of the slip plane can easily be determined in the case of fcc crystals.111 111105Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 146
147 5.16 The Notation for the Slip Systems in the Deformation of fcc Crystals
It should lie on the other side of the stress axis from the slip direction and all three direc-
tions should lie roughly on a common great circle. Finally, the indicated combinations of slip
directions and slip planes yield the active slip systems because in each case they represent
the slip system that has the highest resolved shear stress acting on it in a given stereographic
triangle.
Now let us consider the case of a crystal deformed in compression. As shown in
Fig. 5.27B, the slip plane rotates so that it tends to become perpendicular to the stress axis.
In this case, if the orientation of the stress axis is plotted in a standard stereographic pro-
jection, the stress axis will be found to follow a path that passes through the position of
the slip plane normal. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.30, using once again as an example a sin-
gle crystal of a face-centered cubic metal.
5.16 THE NOTATION FOR THE SLIP SYSTEMS IN THE
DEFORMATION OF FCC CRYSTALS
The preceding section has shown that, for an orientation in the center of a stereographic
triangle, one slip system is favored because the resolved shear stress is highest on this
system. This slip system is called the primary slip system . In the example of Fig. 5.28, the
primary slip system for the original stress axis orientation is (111) [10 ]. If the disloca-
tions of this system were to cross-slip, they would have to move onto the other slip plane1a

FIG. 5.30 In compression, the stress axis ( a) rotates toward the
pole of the active slip plane05Ch05.qxd  11/11/08  7:43 PM  Page 147
Chapter 5 Dislocations and Plastic Deformation 148
that contains the [10 ] slip direction. As may be seen in Fig. 5.29, this is the (1 1) plane.
The cross-slip system for the stress axis orientation a1is, accordingly, (1 1) [10 ].
Another important slip system is called the conjugate slip system . This is the system
that becomes the preferred slip system once the rotation of the crystal structure, relative
to its tensile stress axis, results in moving the orientation of the stress axis out of its orig-
inal stereographic triangle into the one adjoining it. This movement of the stress axis on
the stereographic projection is shown in Fig. 5.31, which is an enlarged view of the stan-
dard projection showing only the two stereographic triangles of present interest.
As indicated above, the stress axis position on the stereographic projection tends to
move toward the active slip direction through the positions a1, a2, and a3. Continued
motion of this type carries it to a position such as a4, where it lies in another stereographic
triangle where the resolved shear stress is greater on the (1 ) [110] slip system. As a
result, slip will be instituted on this slip system, called the conjugate slip system, and the
stress axis will now move along a path toward the [110] slip direction. Theoretically,
while this shift in the slip system should occur once the stress axis crosses the boundary
separating the two stereographic triangles, there is always some degree of overshoot
before the conjugate slip system takes over. The degree of this overshoot depends on a
number of factors that will not be discussed here. The diagram shows clearly that slip on
the second (or conjugate) system will bring the stress axis back into the original stereo-
graphic triangle where the primary slip system is again favored. It is therefore to be
expected that the primary slip system will eventually predominate at a point such as a5
and the stress axis will again move toward the slip direction of the primary system. This
oscillation of the stress axis will be repeated a number of times, with the result (shown
in the ﬁgure) that the axis eventually reaches the [211] direction, a direction that lies on
the same great circle as the conjugate and primary slip directions and midway between
them. This is a stable end orientation for the crystal, and once it has obtained this orien-
tation, further deformation will not change the orientation of the crystal relative to the
tensile stress axis.
In the above discussion, the primary, conjugate, and cross-slip slip systems have been
identiﬁed for a given starting orientation of the axis of a crystal. These have involved three
of the possible slip planes in the face-centered cubic structure. The fourth plane, which is
(11 ) in the example in Fig. 5.28, is called the critical plane . 1111 11 1

Strain Stress
FIG. 5.32 Normally when a metal is deformed
to a strain such as eband then it is unloaded, it
will not begin to deform until the stress is raised
back to sb. The strain ebraises the ﬂow stresses
from sato sb.5.17 WORK HARDENING
The drawing in Fig. 5.32 is assumed to represent a typical engineering stress-strain curve
of a polycrystalline pure metal. Note that after the metal begins to deform plastically
above the proportional limit at point a, the stress still continues to rise. This rise in the
ﬂow-stress reﬂects an increase in the strength of the metal caused by the deformation.
That this strength increase is real can be shown by unloading the specimen from a point
such as bon the curve and then by reloading the specimen. Provided that this experiment
does not occur at a temperature where recovery rates are rapid, the stress on the speci-
men will have to be returned to the value sbthat it had prior to the unloading before
macroscopic plastic ﬂow will again occur. Deforming the specimen to a plastic strain eb
has, accordingly, raised the stress at which the metal will ﬂow from sato sb. As will be
shown shortly, the stress at which a metal will ﬂow, the ﬂow stress , is intimately connected
with changes in the dislocation structure in the metal resulting from deformation.
However, it is necessary that we ﬁrst consider a different way of representing the stress-
strain data. The engineering stress-strain curve expresses both stress and strain in terms
of the original specimen dimensions, a very useful procedure when one is interested in
determining strength and ductility data for purposes of engineering design. On the other
hand, this type of representation is not as convenient for showing the nature of the work
hardening process in metals. A better set of parameters are true stress and true strain.
True stress ( st) is merely the load divided by the instantaneous cross-section area, or
5.7
where Pis the load and Ais the cross-section area. If one assumes that during plastic ﬂow
the volume remains effectively constant, then we have A0l0/H11005Al, where A0and l0are the
original cross-section area and gage length, respectively, and Aand lare the corresponding
values of these quantities at any later time. With this assumption, it follows that

where /H9004lis the increase in length of the specimen, sis the engineering stress, and eis the

ing stress, times one, plus the engineering strain. True strain is deﬁned by the relationship
5.9
which states that the true strain is equal to the natural logarithm of one plus the engineer-
ing strain.
The preceding equations for the true stress and true strain are valid as long as the
deformation of the gage section is essentially uniform. In this regard, it is generally
assumed that the gage section deforms uniformly to approximately the point of maximum
stress (point ain Fig. 5.33) on an engineering stress-strain diagram. Beyond this point the
specimen begins to neck and the strain is restricted to the necked region. It is also possible
to follow the relation between the true stress and true strain beyond the point of maxi-
mum load by considering the stress-strain behavior of the metal only in the necked region.
One has, however, to correct for the triaxiality of the stress due to the effective notch pro-
duced by the neck; and the strain should be measured in terms of the specimen diameter
at the neck; rather than in terms of the specimen gage length. If these factors are consid-
ered, one obtains a stress-strain curve of the form of the upper curve in Fig. 5.33. Note that
the true stress continues to rise with increasing stress until the point of fracture. There
seems to be good evidence for assuming that between the point of maximum load and the
point where fracture occurs, the true-stress true-strain curve is approximately a straight
line.20The curve of Fig. 5.33 shows that in a simple tensile test, the true strength of the
metal normally increases with increasing strain until it fractures.
5.18 CONSIDÈRE’S CRITERION
A condition for the onset of necking was originally proposed by Considère21based on the
assumption that necking begins at the point of maximum load. At the maximum load

where Pis the load, Ais the cross-section area, and stis the true stress. In effect, this rela-
tionship states that for a given strain increment, the resulting decrease in specimen area
reduces the load-carrying ability of the cross-section by the same amount that the load-carrying ability of the specimen is increased by the rise in its strength due to strain hard-ening. The above relationship may be rearranged to read
5.11
In plastic deformation, a reasonable assumption is that the volume remains constant, so that

5.13
where lis the specimen gage length and dl/lis et, the true strain. Therefore,
5.14
This is Considère’s criterion for necking. When the slope of the true-stress true-straincurve, ds
t/det, is equal to the true stress st, necking should begin. As will be shown
presently, this relationship can help to rationalize a basic difference in the observed stress-strain behavior of face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic metals.
5.19 THE RELATION BETWEEN DISLOCATION DENSITY
AND THE STRESS
With the development of the transmission electron microscope technique, it has beenpossible to make direct studies of the dislocation structure in deformed metals. Theseinvestigations have indicated that for a very wide range of metals there exists a rathersimple relationship between the dislocation density and the flow-stress of a metal.Thus, let us assume that Fig. 5.34 represents the general shape of the stress-straincurve of a metal and that a series of specimens are deformed to different strains, asindicated by the marked points along the curve. Furthermore, let us assume that onreaching the specified strains, they are unloaded, sectioned for observation in the elec-tron microscope, and that dislocation density measurements are made on the foils.Figure 5.35 shows the actual experimental results obtained using a set of titaniumspecimens. This data corresponds to specimens of three different grain sizes. Note thatall of the data plots on the same straight line. Data such as this supports the assump-tion that the stress varies directly as the square root of the dislocation density, or
s/H11005s0/H11001kr1/25.15
where ris the measured dislocation density in centimeters of dislocation per unit volume,
kis a constant, and s0is the stress obtained when r1/2is extrapolated to zero. This result is
good evidence that the work hardening in metals is directly associated with the build-updst

of the dislocation density in the metal. While the above relationship corresponds to data
from polycrystalline specimens, the relationship has also been observed in single-crystal
specimens. In this case, it is more proper to express the relationship in terms of the
resolved stress on the active slip plane τ. This gives us

where τ0is the extrapolated shear stress corresponding to a zero dislocation density.
Actually, if the dislocation density were zero, then the metal could not be deformed. As a
consequence, s0or τ0are best considered as convenient constants rather than as simple
physical properties.
5.20 TAYLOR’S RELATION
In 1934, Taylor22proposed a theoretical relationship that is basically equivalent to the
experimentally observed functional relationship between the ﬂow stress and the disloca-tion density. In the model that he used, it was assumed that all the dislocations moved onparallel slip planes and the dislocations were parallel to each other. This model has sincebeen elaborated by Seeger
23and his collaborators. In brief, this approach assumes that if
the dislocation density is expressed in numbers of dislocations intersecting a unit area,then the average distance between dislocations is proportional to r
/H110021/2. As shown earlier
in Sec. 4.10, the stress ﬁeld of a dislocation varies as 1/ r, or in general we may write
5.17
where mis the shear modulus, bis the Burgers vector, and ris the distance from the dis-
location. Now consider two edge dislocations on parallel slip planes. If they are of the samesign, they will exert a repulsive force on each other. If they are of opposite sign, the forcewill be attractive. In either case, this interaction must be overcome in order to allow thedislocations to continue to glide on their respective slip planes. Since, as shown above, theaverage distance between dislocations is proportional to r
/H110021/2, we have
τ/H11005ambr1/25.18
or
τ/H11005kr1/25.19
where kis a constant of proportionality equal to amb.
5.21 THE OROWAN EQUATION
A relationship between the velocity of the dislocations in a test specimen and the appliedstrain rate will now be derived. This expression is known as the Orowan equation.
As shown in Figs. 5.36A and 5.36B, when an edge dislocation moves completely
across its slip plane, the upper half of the crystal is sheared relative to the lower half by anamount equal to one Burgers vector. It can also be deduced and rigorously proved
24
(Fig. 5.36C) that if the dislocation moves only through a distance /H9004x, then the top surface
of the crystal will be sheared by an amount equal to b(/H9004x/x), where xis the total distance
across the slip plane. In other words, the displacement of the upper surface will be in pro-portion to the fraction of the slip plane surface that the dislocation has crossed, or tob(/H9004A/A), where Ais the area of the slip plane and /H9004Ais the fraction of it passed over by
the dislocation. Since the shear strain ggiven to the crystal equals the displacement
b(/H9004A/A) divided by the height zof the crystal, we have

since Azis the volume of the crystal. For the case where nedge dislocations of length l
move through an average distance /H9004, this relation becomes

where r, the dislocation density, is equal to nl/V. If, in a time interval /H9004t, the dislocations
move through the average distance /H9004, we have

This expression, derived for the speciﬁc case of parallel edge dislocations, is a general
relationship, and it is customary to consider that rrepresents the density of all the mobile
dislocations in a metal whose average velocity is assumed to be . Furthermore, if is the
tensile strain rate in a polycrystalline metal, a reasonable assumption is that

5.3 There are three slip systems on an fcc octahedral

sponding to this plane. Mark the three /H2085510/H20856slip directions
on the (111) great circle. Then plot the position of the
[310] direction on the standard projection. If a tensile
stress is applied along the [310] direction, what would be
the magnitude of the Schmid factor (i.e., cos ucos f) for
the (111)[10 ] slip system with this stress axis orientation?

tems? Explain.
(b)If the (11 2) [ 23] slip system were to operate
could the crystal be deformed in the direction of its basal
plane pole?

5.17 Johnston and Gilman have reported that in a grown
LiF crystal that has been subjected to a constant stress of
1100 gm/mm
2(10.8 MPa), the dislocation velocity at
249.1 K was 6 /H1100310/H110023cm/s (6 /H1100310/H110025m/s) and at 227.3 K
the velocity was 10/H110026cm/s (10/H110028m/s). They also observed
that their data suggested an Arrhenius relationshipbetween the dislocation velocity and the absolute temper-ature so that one might write /H9263/H11005Aexp(/H11002Q/RT ), where /H9263
is the dislocation velocity, Ais a constant of proportional-
ity, Qan effective activation energy in J/mol, Rthe
international gas constant (8.314 J/mol /H11080K) and Tis in K.
Use the velocity vs. temperature data of Johnston andGilman, given above, to determine Qand Afor their LiF

obtained using the relation

Once Qhas been determined, Amay be obtained by
substitution back into the Arrhenius equation.
5.18 (a) Johnston and Gilman also observed that, at a
constant temperature, the dislocation velocity obeyed a
power law. Assuming that the dislocation velocity expo-nent, m, is 16.5 and that the stress, D, for a velocity of
1 cm/s is 5.30 MPa, determine the stress in MPa neededto obtain a velocity that is 5 times greater.

1586.1 GRAIN BOUNDARIES
In the previous chapters we have been concerned primarily with a study of the
properties of very pure metals in the form of single crystals. Single crystal studies areimportant because they lead to quicker understanding of many basic phenomena.However, single crystals are essentially a laboratory tool and are rarely found incommercial metal objects which, as a rule, consist of many thousands of microscopicmetallic crystals. Figure 6.1 shows the crystalline structure of a typical polycrystalline
(many crystal) specimen magniﬁed 350 times. The average diameter of the crystals isapproximately 0.05 mm, and each crystal is seen to be separated from its neighbors bydark lines, the grain boundaries. The grain boundaries appear to have an appreciablewidth, but this is only because the surface has been etched in an acid solution in orderto reveal their presence.

not show grain boundaries. The width of a grain boundary is, therefore, very small.
Grain boundaries, which disrupt long-range crystalline order, play an important part in
determining the properties of a metal. For example, at low temperatures the grain bound-
aries are, as a rule, quite strong and do not weaken metals. In fact, heavily strained pure
metals, and most alloys, fail at low temperatures by cracks that pass through the crystals and
not the boundaries. Fractures of this type are called transgranular . However, at high temper-
atures and slow strain rates, the grain boundaries lose their strength more rapidly than do
the crystals, with the result that fractures no longer traverse the crystals but run along the
grain boundaries. Fractures of the latter type are called intergranular fractures . A number of
other important grain-boundary aspects will be covered in the following paragraphs.
6.2 DISLOCATION MODEL OF A SMALL-ANGLE
GRAIN BOUNDARY
In 1940, both Bragg and Burgers introduced the idea that boundaries between crystals of the
same structure might be considered as arrays of dislocations. If two grains differ only slightly
in their relative orientation, it is possible to draw a dislocation model of the boundary with-
out difﬁculty. Figure 6.2A shows an example of such an elementary boundary in a simple
cubic lattice in which the crystal on the right is rotated with respect to that on the left about
the [100] direction (the direction perpendicular to the plane of the paper). The line between
points aand bcorresponds to the boundary. The lattice on both sides of the boundary is seen
to be inclined downward toward the boundary, with the result that certain nearly vertical
lattice planes of both crystals terminate at the boundary as positive-edge dislocations. The
greater the angular rotation of one crystal relative to the other, the greater is the inclination
of the planes that terminate as dislocations at the boundary, and the closer is the spacing of
the dislocations in the vertical boundary. The dislocation spacing in the boundary thus deter-
mines the angular inclination between the lattices. It is easy to derive a simple expression for
this relationship. Thus, referring to Fig. 6.2B, it can be seen that
sin u/2/H11005b/2d 6.106Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 159
Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 160
where bis the Burgers vector of a dislocation in the boundary and dis the spacing between
the dislocations. If the angle of rotation of the crystal structure across the boundary is
assumed to be small, then sin u/2 may be replaced by u/2, and the equation relating the
angle of tilt across a boundary composed of simple edge dislocations becomes
u/H11005b/d 6.2
As was shown in Sec. 5.2, experimental evidence for small-angle boundaries has been
obtained through the use of suitable etching reagents that locally attack the surface of met-als at positions where dislocations cut the surface. After etching with one of these reagents,small-angle boundaries, consisting of rows of edge dislocations, appear as arrays of well-deﬁned etch pits. According to the discussion in the preceding paragraph, the separationof the etch pits (dislocations) should determine the angular rotation of the lattice on oneside of the boundary relative to that on the other. The fact that X-ray diffraction determi-nations of the same lattice rotation are in agreement with the value predicted by disloca-tion spacings serves as an excellent check on the validity of the dislocation model for smallangle boundaries. Figure 6.3 shows a photograph of low-angle boundaries in a magnesiumcrystal. Low-angle boundaries may also be observed by transmission electron microscopy;an example is shown in Fig. 6.4.
The grain boundary represented in Fig. 6.2 is a very special boundary in which the
two lattices are considered to be rotated only slightly with respect to each other about acommon lattice direction (a cube edge [100]). This, of course, does not represent the gen-eral case of a grain boundary. More complicated grain boundaries with large angles of mis-ﬁt between grains must involve very complicated arrays of dislocations, and no simplepicture of their structure has yet been worked out.
Small-angle boundaries commonly have less than 10–15° of misorientation and can
be described by a dislocation model such as the one shown in Fig. 6.2. When the angle

becomes large, the principal difﬁculty in postulating a suitable dislocation model is that
as the angle of mismatch between grains becomes larger, the dislocations must comecloser together and, in so doing, they tend to lose their identity.

The boundary shown in Fig. 6.2 is special in more than one sense. Not only is the angle ofmisorientation across the boundary small, but also the boundary has only a single degreeof freedom. Actually, there are ﬁve degrees of freedom of a grain boundary, as illustratedin Fig. 6.5. The boundary of Fig. 6.2 is shown again in part A of this illustration. Note thatit is symmetrically positioned between the two crystals that are tilted with respect to eachother about a horizontal axis that runs out of the plane of the paper. This is called a sim-ple symmetrical tilt boundary . In part B, a symmetrical tilt boundary with a vertical tilt axis
is shown. Part C shows a basically different way of orienting two crystals relative to eachother. In this case they are rotated about an axis normal to the boundary, instead of aboutan axis lying in the boundary, as in the tilt boundaries in A and B. This is called a twist
boundary . Such a boundary will normally contain at least two different arrays of screw dis-
locations, in agreement with our earlier discussion on rotational slip in Sec. 5.4.
The examples just shown represent several basically different ways that two crystals
can be oriented with respect to each other. In each case, the boundary was assumed to besymmetrically positioned with respect to the two crystals. In addition, the boundary itself

has two degrees of freedom, as indicated in Figs. 6.5D and 6.5E. These show that the
boundary does not have to be in a symmetry position between the two crystals, but can
be rotated about either of two axes at 90° to each other. Thus, as shown in Fig. 6.5, there
are three ways that we can tilt or twist one crystal relative to another, and two ways that
we can align the boundary between the crystals. An average grain boundary in a polycrys-
talline metal will normally involve, in varying degree, all ﬁve of these degrees of freedom.
It is obvious that the general grain boundary is complex.
6.4 THE STRESS FIELD OF A GRAIN BOUNDARY
It is well known that, except at distances very close to the boundaries, the interiors of
grains or subgrains are free of long-range stresses due to their boundaries. This is equiva-
lent to saying that the boundaries do not possess long-range stress ﬁelds. This fact will now
be demonstrated for the simple tilt boundary in Fig. 6.2, which is shown again in Fig. 6.6
in a more schematic form. Note that in this latter diagram, a slip plane is shown that passes
through one of the boundary dislocations. Now consider the shear stress on this slip planeBoundary Twist

at a distance, x, to the right of the boundary. The contribution to the shear stress at this
point due to a speciﬁc boundary dislocation, such as that at point a, may be obtained using
the shear-stress equation of Eqs. 4.9, or

located at the intersection of the boundary with the slip plane. This curve lies above and to
the right of that due to the boundary. Note, however, that the boundary stress approachesthat of the single dislocation as xbecomes very small. Finally, to further demonstrate the
rapid rate of decrease of the boundary stress with x, Fig. 6.7B shows a second plot in which
the scale of the stress axis has been expanded by a factor of 10. On both diagrams a hori-zontal line has also been drawn to show the approximate size of the critical resolved shearstress (CRSS) of iron. While the shear stress due to a single dislocation exceeds the CRSS atall values of xin this diagram, note that the boundary stress equals the CRSS at a distance
of only about 25 b. Further note that the boundary stress is negligible when xis greater than
approximately 50 b.
6.5 GRAIN-BOUNDARY ENERGY
As demonstrated in Sections 4.13 and 4.14, a strain energy is associated with a dislocationwhen it is in either its screw or edge orientation because the atoms of the crystal arounda dislocation are displaced from their normal equilibrium positions. It is also generally truethat any dislocation, no matter what its orientation, possesses a strain energy. Since a grainboundary can consist of an array of dislocations, grain boundaries should also have strainenergies. Because of the inherent two-dimensional nature of a grain boundary, its energyis normally expressed in terms of an energy per unit area (J/m
2).
In order to demonstrate the nature of this grain-boundary energy we shall now con-
sider the simple tilt boundary of Figs. 6.2 and 6.6. Equation 6.6 can be taken as the startingpoint for the computation of the energy of a tilt boundary. Following the derivation in Hirthand Lothe,
1it will ﬁrst be assumed that there are two inﬁnitely long parallel tilt boundaries,
one composed of positive edge dislocations and the other of negative edge dislocations,which are arranged such that for each positive edge dislocation in one boundary there is anegative edge dislocation on its slip plane in the other boundary. If the distance betweenthese tilt boundaries is very large, the speciﬁc energy of formation of the pair of boundariesshould be just twice that needed for the formation of one of the boundaries.
Now suppose that there is a positive and negative pair of edge dislocations on the same
slip plane, and that the pair is brought together until their separation is r
0/H11005b/a, where
ais the factor that accounts for the strain energy at the dislocation cores. At this distance
the core energies of the two dislocations should cancel each other. Consequently, on sep-arating the dislocations from this position, the work of separation should equal the inter-action energy of the pair. Next consider that the positive dislocation lies in an inﬁnitelylong tilt boundary and that the negative edge dislocation is a single dislocation. The force(per unit length) attracting the negative dislocation toward the positive boundary is τ
xyb.
Therefore, it may be deduced that the energy per unit length of a dislocation in eitherboundary equals one half the total interaction energy obtained by the following equation:
6.7
where τ
xyis obtained from Eq. 6.6. Now if we let h/H11005px/dand h0/H11005pb/ad, Eq. 6.7
becomes:

Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 166
Multiplying the solution to this equation by 1/ d, the number of dislocations per unit area,
yields gb, the energy per unit area of the boundary. Thus,
6.9
If the use of Eq. 6.9 is limited to tilt boundaries with a tilt angle smaller than a few
degrees, then by Eq. 6.2, we may take u/H11005b/dwhere bis the Burgers vector and dthe sep-
aration between a pair of adjacent boundary dislocations. In this case, h0will be small and
Eq. 6.9 may be written:
6.10
where gbis the energy per unit area of the boundary, mthe shear modulus, bthe
Burgers vector, uthe tilt angle of the boundary, aa factor accounting for the disloca-
tion core energy, and nPoisson’s ratio. This is basically the Shockley-Read equation
used to obtain the historically signiﬁcant plot shown in Fig. 6.8. The solid line in this
ﬁgure represents the Shockley-Read equation, and the data points are experimental
values. The good correlation between the data and the theoretical curve in Fig. 6.8, at
higher values of u, is now believed to be fortuitous. Theoretically, Eq. 6.10 should only
be accurate to within the experimental error of the data for angles less than a few
degrees. However, it is interesting to compare a plot of the small-angle solution,
Eq. 6.10, with that of the large-angle solution, Eq. 6.9. This is done in Fig. 6.9, where
it is again assumed that the metal is iron, with m/H1100586 GPa, b/H110050.248 nm, n/H110050.3, and
a/H110054. Note that, under these conditions, the two curves do not appear to deviate
signiﬁcantly for angles less than 0.15 radians (8.6°).
A signiﬁcant factor in the gbagainst uequations is the size of the lower integration
limit, r0, in Eq. 6.7. Since r0/H11005b/a, where ais selected to account for the core energy, a
actually determines r0. That ais an important factor is clearly shown in Fig. 6.10, where
three plots of gbagainst u, corresponding to avalues of 1, 2, and 4 respectively, made using
the large-angle equation (Eq. 6.9), are given. These plots also involve the same values of
the other parameters used in Fig. 6.9. In this ﬁgure the curve with the highest surface
energy for a given angle of tilt corresponds to a/H110054 and that with the lowest to a/H110051.gb/H11005mb

6.6 LOW-ENERGY DISLOCATION STRUCTURES, LEDS
It is evident from the preceding section that a tilt boundary has an inherent surface
energy, as is true for grain boundaries in general. Because of the simplicity of the tilt
boundary, one can learn a great deal about the basic characteristics of grain bound-
aries from a study of this type of boundary. It has already been demonstrated that a
tilt boundary does not possess a long-range shear stress field. This is true in spite of
the fact that it is composed entirely of edge dislocations of the same sign and Burgers
vector. The reason for this is that the sign of the contribution to τxyat point xof a given0

Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 168
boundary dislocation in Fig 6.6 depends on the latter’s position in the tilt boundary.
This is demonstrated in Fig. 6.11, where the magnitudes of the contributions to τxyof
the dislocations in the boundary are plotted against n, the ordinal number of the dis-
locations, over the interval from n/H11005/H1100250 and n/H11005/H1100150. Note that large positive con-
tributions come from dislocations with small nvalues, however; as nincreases either
positively or negatively, the contributions become negative. The result is that the net
shear stress τxyat point xbecomes very small when xlies at any reasonable distance
from the tilt boundary.
There remains to be considered the two normal stress components of the boundary
stress at point x, namely sxxand syy. Because of the anti-symmetrical nature of the equa-
tions for sxxand syy(see Eqs. 4.9), the net normal stress contributions from all the dislo-
cations in a tilt boundary sum up to zero for both of the boundary stresses. In brief, both
sxxand syy, due to the edge dislocation lying on the slip plane, are automatically zero at
point xbecause n/H110050 and thus, y/H11005nd/H110050. At the same time, for all other dislocations,
the contribution from a dislocation with an ordinal number /H11001nis cancelled by that from
the dislocation with the ordinal number /H11002n. As a result we may conclude that there is no
effective long-range stress due to a tilt boundary.
Now consider the effect of a random dislocation on the magnitude of the strain energy
when the dislocation is incorporated into a tilt boundary. The energy per unit length of a
tilt boundary dislocation, wbd, can be determined by simply multiplying Eq. 6.9 by dto
remove the multiplying factor, 1/ d, which gives the number of dislocations per meter in the
tilt boundary. One may then compare wbdwith we, the energy per unit length of a random
dislocation, to obtain the energy of a boundary dislocation relative to that of a dislocation
that is well removed from other dislocation. By Sec. 4.14, we, the energy per unit length of
such an edge dislocation in an iron crystal, is 5.41 J/m2, (if it is assumed that it contains
equal numbers of positive and negative edges at a dislocation density r/H110051012m/m3).
Dividing weinto wbd, using the same iron parameters gives the desired ratio. Since wbd
depends on d, the distance between dislocations in the tilt boundary, it is best to consider–50

the variation of wbd/wewith d. (See Fig. 6.12.) Note that even for a spacing, d, between
boundary dislocations of 500 Burgers vectors, there is about a 25 percent decrease in the
energy of the boundary dislocation over that of a random dislocation. This spacing corre-
sponds to a tilt angle of only 6.9 min. An important feature of Fig. 6.12 is that it shows that
as ddecreases, the energy per dislocation also decreases, indicating that there is a driving
force that attracts the edge dislocations to a tilt boundary.
The tilt boundary considered here is only one of a very large number of dislocation
arrays that possess the property of having a low strain energy. Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf2,3has
proposed that these be known as low-energy dislocation structures, or LEDS. A very
signiﬁcant feature of these LEDS is that grain and subgrain boundaries normally fall into
the LEDS category. One of the earliest forms of LEDS was proposed by G. I. Taylor in 1934,
the year that dislocations were ﬁrst used in the ﬁeld of metallurgy. This consists of an equi-
librium array of alternating rows of positive and negative edge dislocations arranged so
that the four nearest neighbors of a given dislocation have the sign opposite to that of the
given dislocation. This low-energy dislocation structure is illustrated in Fig. 6.13. Several
other LEDS are shown in Fig. 6.14. These include a simple dipolar mat in Fig. 6.14A that
may be formed by the locking of dislocations of opposite sign moving on adjacent slip
planes because of the screening interaction of the stress ﬁelds of dislocation of opposite
sign. Figure 6.14B shows another simple form of a LEDS. This is a dipolar wall formed by
kinking on one of the crystallographic slip planes of a crystal. These kinks are a secondary
mechanism of plastic deformation in many crystals, particularly when there are only a lim-
ited number of slip systems. Note that in the kink band the edge dislocations possess a dif-
ferent orientation than in Fig. 6.14A. The result is a dipolar wall composed of two parallel
tilt boundaries containing dislocations of opposite sign.
The LEDS shown previously are normally observed when slip occurs on a single slip
system. When the plastic deformation involves a number of different slip planes and
Burgers vectors, the LEDS can become much more complicated and appear as dislocation

parallel slip planes. (B)When a kink band
forms in a crystal, a dipolar array of edge
dislocations of a different type is created
tangles in which the geometry of the dislocation arrangement is difﬁcult to perceive. The
signiﬁcant factor is that, due to the mutual screening action of the stress ﬁelds of the var-
ious dislocations, there is a signicant decrease in the total strain energy associated with the
dislocations. During plastic deformation there is, thus, a tendency to form cells with a low
internal dislocation density and boundaries between the cells composed of dislocation
tangles. A typical example of this type of microstructure is shown in the electron micro-
graph of Fig. 6.15B. The driving force for the formation of this structure is the strain energy
decrease associated with the formation of the tangles. A very signiﬁcant factor is that, with
increasing plastic deformation and accompanying increases in dislocation density, the cell
size decreases while the number of cells increases. There exists a signiﬁcant empirical rela-
tionship2between the cell size and the dislocation density, which is
6.11
where is the average cell diameter, ka constant, and rthe dislocation density.
It should be pointed out that the formation of LEDS can occur as a result of the solid-
iﬁcation of a metal from its melt and can be inﬂuenced by the process of annealing or heat-
ing of a cold worked metal. This latter subject is considered in Chapter 8 (Annealing).
6.7 DYNAMIC RECOVERY
As may be seen in Figs. 8.13 and 8.14 in Chapter 8 on annealing, the basic effect of high
temperature recovery is the movement of the dislocations resulting from plastic deforma-
tion into subgrain or cell boundaries. In many cases, this process can actually start dur-
ing plastic deformation. When this happens, the metal is said to undergo dynamic recovery .
The tendency for dislocations to form LEDS with a cell structure is quite strong in many
pure metals and exists even to very low temperatures, as can be seen in Fig. 6.15. This
illustration shows two transmission electron microscope foils taken from nickel speci-
mens deformed at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K). Note that for small strains
(9 percent) the dislocation arrangement tends to be roughly uniform. However, when the
strain becomes large (26 percent) a deﬁnite trend toward a cell structure becomes clearly
evident. The size of the cells in this structure is small./H9277/H9277/H11005 k/vr06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 170

FIG. 6.15 These transmission electron micrographs illustrate dynamic recovery in nickel

cell structure that increases at high strains. (This material was published in Scripta Metallurgica,

Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 172
At more elevated temperatures, the effects of dynamic recovery naturally become
stronger because the mobility of the dislocations increases with increasing temperature. As
a result, the cells tend to form at smaller strains, the cell walls (LEDS) become thinner andmuch more sharply deﬁned, and the cell size becomes larger. Dynamic recovery is there-fore often a strong factor in the deformation of metals under hot working conditions.
Dynamic recovery has a strong effect on the shape of the stress-strain curve. This is
because the movement of dislocations from their slip planes into LEDS lowers the averagestrain energy associated with the dislocations. The effect of this is to make it less difﬁcultto nucleate the additional dislocations that are needed to further strain the material.Dynamic recovery thus tends to lower the effective rate of work hardening.
The role of dynamic recovery is not the same in all metals. Dynamic recovery occurs
most strongly in metals of high stacking-fault energies and is not readily observed inmetals of very low stacking-fault energy. These latter are normally alloys such as brass(copper plus zinc). The dislocation structure resulting from cold work in these latter mate-rials often shows the dislocations still aligned along their slip planes. An example is shownin Fig. 6.16. In this case the alloy is one of nickel and aluminum.
The correspondence between the ability of a metal to undergo dynamic recovery and
the magnitude of its stacking-fault energy strongly suggests that the primary mechanisminvolved in dynamic recovery is thermally activated cross-slip. This mechanism is consid-ered in Chapter 23. At present, it is important to note the basic underlying differencebetween dynamic recovery and static recovery, such as occurs in annealing after cold work.In static recovery the movement of the dislocations into the cell walls occurs as a result ofthe interaction stresses between the dislocations themselves. In dynamic recovery, theapplied stress causing the deformation is added to the stresses acting between the disloca-tions. As a result, dynamic recovery effects may be observed at very low temperatures, andat these temperatures the applied stresses can be very large.
6.8 SURFACE TENSION OF THE GRAIN BOUNDARY
The surface energy of a grain boundary has the units of ergs/cm2or J/m2, where
1 erg/cm2/H1100510/H110023J/m2. That is,
6.12
which is equivalent to
6.13
but the units N/m are those of a surface tension. It is often reasonable to assume that solidgrain boundaries possess a surface tension equivalent to that of liquid surfaces. The sur-face tension of crystal boundaries is an important metallurgical phenomenon. Theexperimental data of Fig. 6.8 show that the grain-boundary surface tension is an increas-ing function of the angle of mismatch between grains to an angle of approximately 20°,and then it is essentially constant for all larger angles.
Absolute or numerical values of the surface tension of metal surfaces are difﬁcult to
determine. However, measurements have been made on copper, silver, and gold whichshow that their surface tensions of free surfaces (external surfaces) are of the order ofgG/H11005 N/H11080m

1.2 to 1.8 J/m. External metal surfaces, therefore, possess relatively large surface tensions;
they are approximately 20 times larger than that of liquid water. It has been determined
further that the surface tensions of large-angle grain boundaries equal approximately one-
third of the free surface values, and are therefore of the order of 0.3 to 0.5 J/m.
While absolute values of the surface tension of grain boundaries are difﬁcult to meas-
ure, relative values of boundary-surface energy may be estimated with the aid of a simple
relationship. Let the three lines of Fig. 6.17 represent grain boundaries that lie perpendi-
cular to the plane of the paper and meet in a line the projection of which is o. The three
vectors ga, gb, and gcoriginating at point orepresent, by their directions and magnitudes,
the surface tensions of the three boundaries. If these three force vectors are in static equi-
librium, then the following relationship must be true:
6.14
where a, b, and care the dihedral angles between boundaries.
Since crystal boundaries are regions of misﬁt or disorder between crystals, it is to be
expected that atom movements across and along boundaries should occur quite easily. The
boundary is caused to move by the simple process whereby atoms leave one crystal and
join another crystal on the other side of a boundary. Crystal boundaries in solid metals can
move and should not be thought of as ﬁxed in space. The speed with which crystal bound-
aries move depends on a number of factors. The ﬁrst of these is the temperature, as the
energy that makes it possible for an atom to move from one equilibrium grain-boundary
position to another comes from thermal vibrations. We have, therefore, an analogous sit-
uation to that of atom movements inside crystals where the atoms diffuse into lattice
vacancies as a result of thermally activated jumps. The rate of movement must increase
rapidly with rising temperature. However, other things being equal, it is to be expected
that the same number of atoms would cross a boundary in one direction as in the other,
and that the boundary would be relatively ﬁxed in space. Actually, grain-boundary move-
ments occur only if the energy of the metal as a whole is lowered by a greater movement
of atoms in one direction than in the other. One way that the energy of a specimen can
be lowered by the motion of a grain boundary occurs when it moves into a deformed crys-
tal, leaving behind a strain-free crystal (This is covered in Sec. 8.9.) Another driving force
for movement lies in the energy of the boundaries themselves. A metal can approach a
more stable state by reducing its grain-boundary area. There are two ways in which this
may be achieved. First, boundaries may move so as to straighten out sharply curved
regions; and, second, they may move in such a way that some crystals are caused toga

disappear, while others grow in size. The latter phenomenon, which results in a decrease
in the total number of grains, is called grain growth . (See Sec. 8.20.)
One of the consequences of grain-boundary movement is that if a metal is heated at a
sufﬁciently high temperature for a long enough time, the equilibrium relationship betweenthe surface tensions and the dihedral angles can actually be observed. (See Eq. 6.14.) Inpure metals with randomly oriented crystals, low-angle boundaries occur infrequently, andit may be assumed that the grain-boundary energy is constant for all boundaries. (SeeFig. 6.8.) If the surface energies (surface tension) are equal in each or three boundaries thatmeet at a common line, and if the boundaries have attained an equilibrium conﬁguration,the three dihedral angles must be equal. An examination of the junctions where threeboundaries meet in the photograph, Fig. 6.1, shows a large number of 120° dihedral angles.This fact is surprising when it is considered that many of the grain boundaries are notnormal to the plane of the photograph. In fact, if it were possible to cut the surface so thatall the boundaries were perpendicular to the surface, a good agreement between the exper-imental and predicted angles would be observed. It may be concluded that in a well-annealed pure metal, that is, one that has been heated for a long time at a hightemperature, the grain-boundary intersections form angles very close to 120°.
6.9 BOUNDARIES BETWEEN CRYSTALS OF DIFFERENT PHASES
A phase is deﬁned as a homogeneous body of matter that is physically distinct. The three
states of matter (liquid, solid, and gas) all correspond to separate phases. Thus, a puremetal, for example, copper, can exist in either the solid, liquid, or gaseous phase, eachstable in a different temperature range. In this respect, it would appear that there is no dif-ference between the concepts of phase and state. However, a number of metals areallotropic (polymorphic); that is, they are able to exist in different crystal structures, eachstable in a different temperature range. Each crystal structure in these metals correspondsto a separate phase, and allotropic metals, therefore, possess more than three possiblephases. When pure metals are combined to form alloys, additional crystal structures canresult in certain composition and temperature ranges. Each of these crystal structures initself constitutes a separate phase. Finally, it should be pointed out that a solid solution(a crystal containing two or more types of atoms in the same lattice) also satisﬁes the def-inition of a phase. A good example of a solid solution occurs when copper and nickel aremelted together and then frozen slowly into the solid state. The crystals that form containboth nickel and copper atoms in the same ratio as the original liquid mixture; both typesof atoms occupy the lattice sites of the crystal indiscriminately.
For the present, the concept of phases has been introduced in order to explain addi-
tional surface-tension phenomena. The study of the phases of alloy systems is a topic thatwill be considered in a later chapter.
The grain boundaries of alloys containing crystals of only a single phase should
behave in a manner analogous to those of a pure metal. The crystals of a well-annealedsolid-solution alloy, like the copper-nickel alloy mentioned previously, appear under themicroscope like those of a pure metal. At all points where three grains meet there is amean dihedral angle of 120°.
In alloys of two phases, two types of boundaries are possible: boundaries separating
crystals of the same phase, and boundaries separating crystals of the two phases. Threegrains of a single phase can still intersect on a line, but there is the additional possibilityof two grains of one phase meeting a grain of the other phase at a common intersection.06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 175
Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 176
A junction of this type is shown in Fig. 6.18. If the surface tensions in the boundaries are
in static equilibrium, then
6.15
where g11is the surface tension in the single-phase boundary, g12the surface tension in
the two-phase boundary, and uthe dihedral angle between the two boundaries that
separate phase 2 from phase 1.
Let us solve the above expression for the ratio of the surface tension of the two-phase
boundary to that of the single-phase boundary. This yields
6.16
The ratio g12/g11is plotted as a function of the dihedral angle uin Fig. 6.19. Notice that as
the surface tension of the boundary between two phases approaches half of that of the sin-
gle phase, the dihedral angle falls rapidly to zero. The signiﬁcance of small dihedral angles
is readily apparent in Fig. 6.20, where the shape of the intersection is shown for angles of
10° and 1°. It is apparent that as the angle approaches zero, the second phase moves to form
a thin ﬁlm between the crystals of the ﬁrst phase. Further, if the surface tension of the two-
phase boundary ( g12) falls to a value less than of the single-phase surface tension g11,
static equilibrium of the three forces is not possible and point omoves to the left, which is
equivalent to saying that when the dihedral angle becomes zero, the second phase pene-
trates the single-phase boundaries and isolates the crystals of the ﬁrst phase. Furthermore,
the extent of penetration also depends on the grain-boundary energy. For example, it has
been shown4that for sn-rich particles immersed in molten pb-rich liquid, about two-thirds
of the boundaries were wetted with liquid. The penetration may occur even if the second
phase is present in almost negligible quantities. A good example occurs in the case of bis-
muth in copper. The surface tension of a bismuth-copper interface is so low that the dihe-
dral angle is zero and a minute quantity of bismuth is capable of forming a thin ﬁlm
between the copper crystals. Whereas copper is ordinarily a metal of high ductility and
capable of extensive plastic deformation, bismuth is not. In fact, bismuth is a very brittle1

metal, and when it forms a continuous ﬁlm around copper crystals, the copper loses its duc-
tility, even though the total amount of the bismuth impurity is less than 0.05 percent. This
loss in ductility is observed at all temperatures at which copper is worked.
In a number of important metallurgical cases, second-phase impurities remain in the
liquid state until a temperature is reached well below the freezing point of the major
phase. The amount of harm that these impurities (in small percentages) can do to the
plastic properties of metals is a function of the surface tension between liquid and solid.
If this interfacial energy is high, the liquid tends to form discrete globules with little effect
on the hot working properties of metals. On the other hand, low interfacial energies lead
to liquid grain-boundary ﬁlms. These, of course, are very harmful to the plastic proper-
ties of metals.
Let us take the case of iron containing small quantities of sulphur as an impurity. Iron
sulﬁde is liquid at temperatures well below the freezing point of iron. This range includes
the temperature range normally used for hot rolling iron and steel products.
Unfortunately, the surface energy of the iron sulﬁde to iron boundary is very close to one-
half that of the boundary between iron crystals, and the liquid sulﬁde forms a grain-
boundary ﬁlm that almost completely separates the iron crystals. Since a liquid possesses
no real strength, iron or steel in this condition is brittle and cannot be hot-worked with-
out disintegrating. In such a case as this, when a metal becomes brittle at high tempera-
tures, the metal is said to be “hot short,” that is, its properties are deﬁcient at hot-working
temperatures.
With regard to the problem caused by sulfur in promoting hot shortness, it should be
pointed out that this problem has for many years been alleviated by incorporating in the
steel a small amount of manganese as an alloying element. Manganese has a very strong
ability to combine with the sulfur in a steel to form globules, which are solid at the rolling
temperatures of steel. The MnS particles have a much less deleterious effect on the hot
rolling properties.
It has already been explained that a second phase in small quantities forms thin inter-
granular ﬁlms when the dihedral angle is zero. For dihedral angles greater than zero but
less than 60°, the equilibrium conﬁguration is one where small quantities of the second
phase run as a continuous network along the grain edges of the ﬁrst phase; that is, along
the lines where three grains of the ﬁrst phase would meet in the absence of the second
phase. According to Fig. 6.19, a dihedral angle of 60° corresponds to a ratio of interphase
to single-phase surface tensions of 0.582. Many liquid-solid interfaces possess surface
tensions less than 0.600 of the solid-boundary surface tension. Therefore, when liquidsSecond phase

and solids coexist, there is a strong possibility that the liquid will form a continuous
network throughout the metal. Since diffusion in liquids is more rapid than in solids, thisnetwork forms a convenient path for rapid diffusion of elements (both good and bad) intothe center of the metal.
When the dihedral angle between the interphase boundaries is greater than 60°, the
second phase no longer forms a continuous network unless it is present as the majorphase. The second phase, if present in small quantities, now forms discrete globular parti-cles, usually along the boundaries of the ﬁrst-phase crystals. (See Fig. 6.21.)
Below approximately 1273 K, iron sulﬁde is no longer a liquid, but a solid. Solid iron
sulﬁde forms an equilibrium angle with solid iron greater than 60° and, therefore, tendsto crystallize as discrete particles of FeS instead of a continuous grain-boundary ﬁlm. Smalldiscrete particles of a second phase, even though they may be brittle in themselves, are farless damaging to the properties of a metal than are continuous brittle grain-boundaryﬁlms. Iron containing sufﬁcient FeS to embrittle it at hot-working temperatures will retainmuch of its ductility at room temperature.
6.10 THE GRAIN SIZE
The size of the average crystal is a very important structural parameter in a polycrystallineaggregate of a pure metal or single-phase metal. Unfortunately, this is a difﬁcult variableto deﬁne precisely. In many cases, the three-dimensional shape of a grain is very com-plex, and even in those cases where the grains appear to be of nearly equal size in a two-dimensional micrograph, the grains can vary through a very wide range of sizes. Hull

has actually demonstrated this by allowing mercury to penetrate along the grain bound-aries of a high zinc brass (beta brass) which embrittled the boundaries and allowed theindividual grains to be separated from each other. Fig. 6.22 shows a set of his photographscorresponding to three of some 15 size classiﬁcations into which he grouped the grains.The upper picture shows the smallest grains and the bottom the largest. The middle pho-tograph represents an average size. Most metallographic structures are observed on pla-nar sections, and linear measurements made on such surfaces are not normally capableof being accurately related to the grain diameter, which is a property of a complex, three-dimensional quantity.
In spite of the problems indicated above, some sort of measurement to deﬁne the size
of the structural unit in a polycrystalline material is needed, and the concept of an aver-age grain size is widely used in the literature.
Perhaps the most useful parameter for indicating the relative size of the grains in
a microstructure is determined by the linear intercept method. This quantity iscalled the mean grain intercept and is the average distance between grain boundaries

(above 60°), the second phase (when present in
small quantities) tends to form small discreteparticles, usually in the boundaries of the ﬁrstphase06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 178

Hull, Westinghouse Electric CompanyResearch Laboratories, Pittsburgh. Copies were furnished courtesy ofK. R. Craig.)06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 179

along a line laid down on a photomicrograph. In making this measurement, one can
lay a straight edge of perhaps 10 cm in length down on the photograph and thencount the number of boundaries that the edge of the instrument crosses. This meas-urement should then be repeated several times, placing the straight edge down onthe photograph in a random fashion. The total number of intersections, whendivided by the total line length over which the linear measurement was made, andmultiplied by the magnification in the photograph, yields the quantity 
l, the aver-
age number of grain boundaries intercepted per centimeter. The reciprocal of thisquantity is , which is often used as a parameter for indicating the approximate grainsize. Thus we have
6.17
Even though there is actually no geometrical relationship between and the actual
average grain diameter d, this quantity is widely used to represent the grain diameter. In
this regard, it might be mentioned that such a relationship would exist if all grains had thesame shape and size. On the other hand, quantitative metallography
6has shown7that the
reciprocal of , that is l, is directly related to the amount of grain-boundary surface area
in a unit volume. The relationship in question is
Sn/H110052l6.18
where Snis the surface area of the grain boundaries per unit volume. It is therefore well
to recognize that when one determines , what is actually determined is the reciprocal ofthe grain-boundary surface area in a unit volume.
6.11 THE EFFECT OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES ON MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES: HALL-PETCH RELATION
Polycrystalline metals almost always show a strong effect of grain size on hardness andstrength, except possibly at very elevated temperatures. The smaller the grain size thegreater the hardness or ﬂow-stress, where the ﬂow-stress is the stress in a tension testcorresponding to some ﬁxed value of strain. Figures 6.23 and 6.24 support this state-ment. In the ﬁrst of these two illustrations, the hardness of titanium is plotted as a func-tion of the reciprocal of the square root of the grain size. The hardness measurementscorresponding to these data were obtained using a Vickers 138° diamond-pyramidindentor. According to the illustration, it is possible to write an empirical relationship ofthe form
H/H11005Ho/H11001kHd/H110021/26.19
where His the hardness, dis the average grain diameter, kHis the slope of the straight line
drawn through the data, and Hois the intercept of the line with the ordinate axis and
corresponds to the hardness expected at a hypothetical inﬁnite grain size. It is not neces-sarily the hardness of a single crystal because the mechanical properties of a crystal are ingeneral nonsotropic, so that the hardness of a crystal may vary with the orientation of thecrystal.l N N l l l /H110051

In Fig. 6.24, tensile test data is plotted for titanium specimens tested at room temper-
ature. Here the ﬂow-stress corresponding to three different strains (2 percent, 4 percent,

where sis the ﬂow-stress and soand kare constants equivalent to Hoand kHin the
previous equation.
A linear relationship between the ﬂow-stress and square root of the dislocation den-
sity was originally proposed by both Hall8and Petch9and, as a consequence, it is now
generally known as the Hall-Petch equation. Such a relationship can be rationalized bydislocation theory assuming that grain boundaries act as obstacles to slip dislocations, caus-ing dislocations to pile up on their slip planes behind the boundaries. The number of dis-locations in these pile-ups is assumed to increase with increasing grain size and magnitudeof the applied stress. Furthermore, these pile-ups should produce a stress concentration inthe grain next to that containing a pile-up that varies with the number of dislocations inthe pile-up and the magnitude of the applied stress. Thus, in coarse-grained materials, thestress multiplication in the next grain should be much greater than that in ﬁne-grainedmaterials. This means that in the ﬁne-grained materials a much larger applied stress isneeded to cause slip to pass through the boundary than is the case with coarse-grainedmaterials.
Although the Hall-Petch relation has been widely accepted, it has by no means been
completely veriﬁed. While in many cases grain size data can be plotted to yield an appar-ent linear relationship between sand d
/H110021/2, as in Fig. 6.24, Baldwin10has shown that the
general scatter normally observed with this type of data can, in many cases, give equallygood linear plots when sis plotted against d
/H110021or d/H110021/3.
Overriding the question of whether a variation of sor Hwith d/H110021/2has true physical
signiﬁcance is the fact that plots such as those in Figs. 6.23 and 6.24 clearly demonstratethe dependence of the hardness and ﬂow-stress on the grain size. Note, for example, thatthe tensile ﬂow-stress of titanium at 2 percent strain increases from about 448 MPa at agrain size of 17 microns to about 565 MPa at a grain size of 0.8 microns (10
/H110024cm).
Nevertheless, as will be discussed in the following section, there are now clear indicationsfor deviations from the classical Hall-Petch relation as grain sizes approach nanometerdimensions.
6.12 GRAIN SIZE EFFECTS IN NANOCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS
Nanocrystalline is a terminology that has been used in recent years to describematerials whose grain size does not exceed 10 nm. This upper limit of the grain size ischosen arbitrarily for convenience rather than being based on a physical significanceor a characteristic length scale. The central question in understanding the influence ofthe grain size on the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials is whether thedeformation mechanisms are similar to those of coarse-grained materials, and if sowhether the Hall-Petch relation as defined in Eq. 6.2 holds true for nanograins. Inother words, the question is whether or not the relation as derived for coarse-grainedmaterials can be extrapolated to determine mechanical properties in the nanocrys-talline range.06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 182
183 6.12 Grain Size Effects in Nanocrystalline Materials
As discussed in the previous section, the Hall-Petch relation can be rationalized
based on the assumption that grain boundaries act as obstacles to slip dislocations,
causing their pile-up on their slip planes behind boundaries. The number of the piled-
up dislocations is also assumed to be large and to increase with increasing grain size and
magnitude of the applied stress. As such, much larger applied stress is needed in ﬁne-
grained materials to force slip through the grain boundary and initiate slip in the neigh-
boring grain. From a geometrical point of view, it is obvious that these assumptions
cannot hold true when the grains become so small that they cannot accommodate
many dislocations. Furthermore, grain boundaries in nanocrystalline materials occupy
a larger fraction of the volume than that in coarse-grained materials. As such, grain-
boundary contributions to the deformation can cause deviations from the classical Hall-
Petch relation.
Sanders et al.11have investigated tensile behavior of high-purity Cu and Pd
nanocrystalline metals with grain sizes in the range of 10 to 110 nm. The samples were
produced by inert gas condensation followed by warm compaction. The hardness of the
samples was found to follow the coarse-grained Hall-Petch relation down to grain size
around 16 nm. Below this size, the hardness values were found to deviate from the rela-
tion and level off, as shown in Fig. 6.25. The authors indicate that the drop in the hard-
ness could be indicative of a change in the deformation mechanism as grains fall into
this nanometer range or due to the change in the processing conditions of the samples
with ﬁner grains. The tensile yield stress of samples with 110 nm grain size was also
found by Sanders et al. to be close to the value predicted from the extrapolation of the
Hall-Petch relation for coarse-grained copper, as shown in the ﬁgure. However, the yield
strength dropped off dramatically as grain size fell below 110 nm. The failure of
the ﬁner-grained samples also occurred with little plastic deformation with a fracture

surface perpendicular to the stress axis. The authors believe that this observation may
indicate that dislocation-assisted deformation mechanisms that operate in coarse-
grained materials may not operate effectively in nanocrystalline materials. However, the
authors caution that the reduction in the yield strength and brittle failures could be also
due to the ﬂows and defects introduced during processing of the ﬁner-grain materials.
Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6.25, the bulk density of the ﬁner grained materials was appre-
ciably lower than that of the coarser-grained ones, indicating the presence of apprecia-
ble porosity in the samples. As such, the tensile measurements alone may not have
sufﬁcient accuracy to ascertain the applicability of the Hall-Petch relation to nanocrys-
talline materials.
Figure 6.26 shows yield stress data as a function of grain size for several metallic
systems, as compiled by Masumura et al.12The line with slope of one in the figure
represents the Hall-Petch relation given by Eq. 6.2. According to these authors, for
grain sizes larger than about 1 mm, the data follow the Hall-Petch relation; the yield
strength increases as grain size decreases. At grain sizes between 1 mm and 30 nm, the
Hall-Petch relation roughly holds, but the increase in the strength with grain size is
less than that predicted by the Hall-Petch relation. In contrast, for grain sizes smaller
than about 30 nm, the yield strength actually decreases with decreasing grain size.
The deviations from the classical Hall-Petch relation presented in Figs. 6.25 and 6.26
indicate that the relation may not hold true below a certain critical grain size. Several mod-
els and arguments have been advanced to explain the deviation of mechanical behavior of
nanocrystalline material below a certain critical grain size from the classical Hall-Petch
relation. Among them are the possibility of diffusional creep at room temperature13and
dislocation accommodated boundary sliding.14

185 6.13 Coincidence Site Boundaries
As can be surmised from the above discussion, the exact inﬂuence of the grain size
in nanoscale range on the strength of the material is a matter of dispute. Part of the
difﬁculty in answering this question is that the property measurements for nanocrys-talline materials, particularly those done under tensile conditions, do not have sufﬁ-cient accuracy to ascertain the applicability of the Hall-Petch relation in this region.Another difﬁculty is that nanocrystalline materials often include porosities, ﬂaws, orimpurities. As such, a direct comparison with high-purity coarse-grained counterpartscannot be made. As Andrievski and Glezer conclude,
15further studies are required to
determine the nature of size effects in nanocrystalline materials.
6.13 COINCIDENCE SITE BOUNDARIES
In 1949 Kronberg and Wilson,16as a result of a study of secondary recrystallization
in copper, were able to call attention to an important form of grain boundary: thecoincident site boundary . In their investigation they first very heavily cold rolled some
copper plates, which were then annealed at 400 °C (600 K) to produce a fine-grainedmicrostructure with an approximate grain size of 0.03 mm (3 mm). This structure
had a very pronounced texture; that is, nearly all the grains of the metal had close tothe same orientation in space. Moreover, the grains were aligned so that each had acube plane (i.e., a {100} plane) almost parallel to the rolling plane of the sheet. Inaddition, a /H20855010 /H20856direction of these grains tended to be closely aligned to the direc-
tion in which the sheet had been rolled. Actually, this type of texture has beenobserved in a number of fcc metals and is known as a cube texture . When these sheets
with the cube texture were heated to between 800 and 1000 °C (1073 to 1273 K), anew set of larger crystals of a different orientation appeared. This form of graingrowth is called secondary recrystallization .
Kronberg and Wilson next quantitatively compared the orientations of these new
grains to those of the original cube texture and found that their two orientations wererather simply related. They also observed that a secondary recrystallized grain orientationcould be obtained from that of an original grain by a rotation of either 22° or 38° about a/H20855111 /H20856axis, or, in a few cases, by a 19° rotation about the /H20855010 /H20856axis aligned parallel to the
rolling direction.
Kronberg and Wilson then demonstrated that these rotations could produce surfaces,
separating the new crystal from the old, that contained a number of positions where theatoms in both crystals were in coincidence. These were called coincidence sites . As an exam-
ple, consider Fig. 6.27 based on a drawing in the Kronberg and Wilson paper. This assumesa 22° rotation about a /H20855111 /H20856axis in an fcc crystal. Net A corresponds to the atomic arrange-
ment on the (111) plane of the parent crystal where the atom centers are indicated byopen circles. Net B, on the other hand, corresponds to the (111) plane in a secondarilyrecrystallized crystal. Here the atom centers are designated by ﬁlled-in circles. The two netsare rotated relative to each other by 22° about the [111] pole, which is assumed to lie atthe center of the drawing. The points where atoms on the two nets coincide are shown aslarger open circles. Note that the coincidence sites also deﬁne a similar but larger hexago-nal net than the nets A and B. In other words, the coincidence sites form a net that is amultiple of the primitive net. A boundary of this type, with a large fraction of coincidencesites, is considered to have valuable properties, such as a higher mobility or the ability tosupport a rapid rate of grain growth.06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 185
Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 186
6.14 THE DENSITY OF COINCIDENCE SITES
By a direct count, Kronberg and Wilson were able to show that the number of coincidence
sites in the boundary of Fig. 6.27 was equal to 1/7 of the atoms in either net A or B. What
is more, they also pointed out that the remaining atoms of the two nets, those not in coin-
cidence, could be brought into alignment by relatively small atom movements of the order
of 1/3 of an atomic distance.
The fraction of atoms in coincidence, at a boundary of this type, is generally known
as the density of coincidence sites . The reciprocal of the density, however, is more commonly
used as a parameter to describe a coincidence site boundary. This is usually designated by
the Greek symbol /H9018. Thus, for the boundary in Fig. 6.27, /H9018/H110057.
6.15 THE RANGANATHAN RELATIONS
The theory of coincidence site boundaries received a large advance from a paper published
by Ranganathan17in 1966. In this paper he pointed out that not only could rotational sym-
metry operations, such as a 90° rotation about a /H20855100 /H20856pole or a 120° rotation about a /H20855111 /H20856
pole, bring a lattice back into complete self-coincidence, but also partial self-coincidence
might be attained with speciﬁc rotations about other axes. He then went on to formulate
simple ground rules that allow one to deﬁne these other rotations.
Ranganathan also pointed out that these latter rotations not only were able to produce
a coincidence site net at a boundary between two crystals, but they were also capable ofNet A

187 6.16 Examples Involving Twist Boundaries
yielding the concept of a coincidence site three-dimensional lattice. In this latter case, one
needs only to consider that two identical crystals, originally in perfect coincidence, arerotated relative to each other about the same axis. Thus, the coincidence site net in Fig. 6.27represents a planar section through a coincidence site lattice.
There are four basic factors involved in a coincidence site lattice. The ﬁrst is the axis
[hkl] about which the rotation occurs; the second is the rotation angle, u, about this axis;
the third is the coordinates of a coincidence site in the coincident site net on ( hkl), the
plane normal to the axis of rotation; and the fourth is /H9018, the reciprocal of the density of
coincidence sites in the ( hkl) net. These four factors are not all independent. Actually,
Ranganathan was able to formulate equations giving both uand /H9018in terms of the Miller
indices and the coordinates ( x, y) of a coincidence site in the plane ( hkl). These equations
are

6.16 EXAMPLES INVOLVING TWIST BOUNDARIES
The application of the Ranganathan relations will now be demonstrated with the aid of sev-eral elementary examples involving twist boundaries. First consider a simple cubic latticerotated about one of its cube axes, [100]. This case is treated in Fig. 6.28 in which the draw-ing shows the (100) plane. In this illustration the xand yaxes are the [010] and [001] direc-
tions, respectively. The unit of measurement along these axes is the length of one edge of thesimple cubic unit cell. Rotation of the lattice through an arbitrary angle uabout [100] will
cause the xand yaxes to assume the rotated positions x/H11032and y/H11032. Since a rotation about [100]
is being considered, h/H110051 while kand lare 0, so that N/H110051. A coincidence site lattice can be
formed if one takes x/H110052 and y/H110051. In this case u/H110052 tan
/H110021(1/2) 
while /H9018/H1100522/H1100112(1)/H110055. In Fig. 6.28 the atoms corresponding to the x, y coordinates are
open circles, the atoms in the rotated x/H11032/y/H11032coordinates are ﬁlled-in circles, and coincidence
sites are represented by larger open circles. Notice that the coincidence sites also deﬁne asimple lattice with a cell whose sides in the (100) plane equal , where ais the lattice
constant of the primitive lattice. Thus, the cell size of the coincidence site lattice is ﬁve timeslarger than that of the primitive lattice. Note that the ratio of the cell sizes also equals thevalue of /H9018.
Another possibility, involving a rotation about [100], occurs when one chooses
x/H110053 and y/H110051. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.29, where u/H110052 tan
/H110021(1/3) 
and /H9018/H1100532/H1100112/H110801/H1100510. However, in regard to the value of 10 for /H9018, it has been
demonstrated that in a cubic lattice /H9018can only take odd values. That is, if /H9018is even, it
should be divided by multiples of 2 until an odd number is attained. Thus, the propervalue for /H9018is 10/2 or 5. This is the same as for the ﬁrst rotation where x/H110052 and y/H110051.
Note that the same coincidence site lattice may be obtained by either a rotation of 53.1°v1/H1100536.9/H11034v5av1/H1100553.1/H1103406Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 187

FIG. 6.28 A rotation of 53.1° about a /H20855100 /H20856axis of a simple cubic crystal
gives this coincident site boundary with /H9018/H110055. The coincident sites also
form a lattice with a unit cell whose sides are equal to in the bound-
ary. The cell size of the reciprocal lattice is thus ﬁve times larger than
that of the primitive latticev5aNet A y y‘

or 36.9°. The sum of these angles equals 90°. This result is related to the four-fold sym-
metry about a /H20855100 /H20856cubic axis.
We will now consider another example involving a rotation about a /H20855111 /H20856axis of an
fcc crystal. This is the Kronberg and Wilson boundary in Fig. 6.27. In this case, one uses
a tetragonal unit cell, which has a rectangular cross-section on a {111} plane as indicated
in Fig. 6.30. Here the xand yaxes are assumed to lie respectively along the [011] and
[211] directions of the (111) plane. The length of the unit cell along the xaxis is the dis-
tance between atom centers in a close-packed direction of the crystal and thus is equal to
b, the magnitude of an fcc crystal’s Burgers vector. In the yor [211] direction, the length
of the unit cell is larger and equals . These xand yunits may be used in Eqs. 6.12 and
6.13. The coincidence site lattice deduced graphically by Kronberg and Wilson and shown
in Fig. 6.27 can be obtained by letting x= 9 and y= 1 with N=12+12+12= 3. This gives
/H9018=92+12.3 = 84. Dividing 84 by 12 to obtain an odd number makes /H9018= 7. The corre-
sponding value of uis 2 tan/H110021(1/9) , which is close to the 22° reported by
Kronberg and Wilson. The alternate rotation of 38° observed by these authors to give this
same lattice, with u= 7, corresponds to x= 5 and y= 1, which gives u= 38.2° using the
Ranganathan equations.
6.17 TILT BOUNDARIES
The coincidence site nets in Figs. 6.27 to 6.29 represent boundaries between crystals that
are rotated relative to each other across these nets; consequently, they are twist boundaries.
The concept of interfaces containing coincidence sites to develop tilt boundaries can also be
used. However, the arrangement or pattern that the coincidence sites may take in a tilt
boundary may vary considerably. In the twist boundary obtained by a 53.1° rotation about
a /H20855100 /H20856pole in Fig. 6.28, the coincidence sites form a two-dimensional square array with a
cell size area ﬁve times larger than the cell area of the primitive lattice; that is, /H9018/H110055. A tilt
boundary can also be created by rotating two sections of the same crystal through 53.1° and
joining them together, as shown in Fig. 6.31. The grain boundary in this case is not in the
plane of the paper as it was for the twist boundary. Rather, it is in a horizontal plane nor-
mal to the plane of the ﬁgure. In Fig. 6.31, the atom positions in the B section are shown
as open small circles, those of the A section are shown by ﬁlled-in small circles, and thev3/H1100521.8/H11034v3bb3b

cell on a (111) plane06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:18 AM  Page 189
Chapter 6 Elements of Grain Boundaries 190
coincident sites are illustrated by larger open circles. On the assumption that the B section
of the crystal lies above the grain boundary and the A section below, all of the coincidence
sites that actually exist will lie in the boundary. However, in order to clarify the relation of
these coincidence sites to the coincidence site lattice, the pattern of the coincidence sites is
shown in both the A and B sections of the crystal.
Note that the boundary itself is drawn as a series of steps that conform, in both the A
and B crystal sections, to the Ranganathan coordinates x/H110052 and y/H110051. Thus, the distance
between steps and thus, between coincidence sites on the boundary, equals 
This distance, p, is called the structural periodicity . As may be seen in Fig. 6.31, the coincident
sites in the boundary, which is normal to the plane of the ﬁgure, have a separation p. The
coincidence sites lie in close-packed rows on the plane of the boundary. Thus, each coinci-
dence site along the boundary in Fig. 6.31 is only the outermost of a row of coincidence sites
separated by a distance a, where ais the simple cubic lattice constant.
Note that the structural periodicity, p, of the boundary in Fig. 6.31 equals the length of
an edge of the unit cell of the coincidence site lattice. As shown earlier, a coincidence site
lattice with the same /H9018—for example, 5—may be obtained with a twist rotation of 36.9°
about a /H20855100 /H20856direction. In this case, the Ranganathan coordinates are x/H110053 and y/H110051. The
corresponding tilt boundary is shown in Fig. 6.32. Notice that its structural periodicity, p, is
equal to a diagonal of a coincidence site lattice cell. For a 53.1° rotation, pequaled an edge
of this cell. Thus, the 36.9° and 53.1° rotations yield tilt grain boundaries with different
structural periodicities.
In the tilt boundaries of Figs. 6.31 and 6.33, the circles actually only represent
atom centers. If one considers the atoms as touching spheres, the illustrated bound-
aries would contain a pair of overlapping atoms just to the right of each coincidence2x2/H11001y2/H11005v5a.x‘ x‘

Overlapping atoms
FIG. 6.33 If the atoms of the diagram in Fig. 6.32 are
drawn as hard balls instead of points, one ﬁnds that
there is an overlap of the atoms just to the right of the
coincident sites on the boundary
site on these boundaries, as is demonstrated in Fig. 6.33 for the 36.9° boundary of
Fig. 6.32. As pointed out by Aust,18the problems of this overlap could be relieved by
removing an atom from each of these pairs or by a relative translation of the lattices
above and below the grain boundary as suggested in Fig. 6.34. This results in an
alternation of the ledges between the two crystal halves and the resulting boundary
is known as a relaxed coincidence boundary . Such a boundary is still considered to have
a structural periodicity equivalent to that of the boundary where the atoms of the
two halves are shared at the coincidence sites as in Fig. 6.31. It should also have a
lower grain boundary energy.06Ch06.qxd  11/11/08  8:19 AM  Page 191

1947.1 THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF METALS
Many important metallurgical phenomena depend strongly on the temperature at which
they occur. An important example of practical importance occurs in the softening of hard-ened metals by heating. A brass specimen, hardened by hammering, can be softened to itsoriginal hardness in a few minutes if exposed to a temperature of 900 K. At 600 K it maytake several hours to achieve the same loss of hardness, while at room temperature itmight easily take several thousand years. For all practical purposes it can therefore be saidthat brass will not soften, or anneal, at room temperature.
In recent years, large advances have been made toward theoretical explanations of
such highly temperature-dependent phenomena. Each of the three sciences of heat—thermodynamics, statistical mechanics , and kinetic theory —has contributed to this knowledge
and each approaches the subject of heat differently.
Thermodynamics is based upon laws that are postulated from experimental evidence.
Since the experiments that lead to the laws of thermodynamics were performed on bod-ies of matter containing very large numbers of atoms, thermodynamics is not directly con-cerned with what happens on an atomic scale; it is more concerned with the averageproperties of large numbers of atoms, and mathematical relationships are developedbetween such thermodynamical functions as temperature, pressure, volume, entropy,internal energy, and enthalpy, without consideration of atomic mechanisms. This neglectof atomic mechanisms in thermodynamics has both advantages and disadvantages. Itmakes computations easier and more accurate, but, unfortunately, it tells us nothing aboutwhat makes things happen as they do. As a simple example, consider the equation of state
for an ideal gas
PV/H11005nRT 7.1
where Pis the pressure, Vis the volume, nis the number of moles of gas, Rthe universal
(gas) constant, and Tthe absolute temperature. In thermodynamics, this equation is
derived from experiments (Boyle’s law, law of Gay-Lussac, and Avogadro’s law). No expla-nation as to the reasons for the existence of this relationship is given.
Kinetic theory , in contrast to thermodynamics, attempts to derive relationships such as
this equation of state, starting with atomic and molecular processes. In college physicstextbooks, classical derivations of Eq. 7.1 that use a simple kinetic approach can be found.In these derivations, the gas atoms are assumed to behave as elastic spheres, to move athigh speeds with random velocities, and to be separated by distances that are large com-pared with the size of the atoms. Using these assumptions, it can be shown that the pres-sure exerted by the gas equals the time rate of change of momentum due to the collisionof gas atoms with the walls of the container. Thus, the pressure is merely the average forceexerted on the walls by the collision of the gas atoms with the walls. It can also be shown
Chapter 7
Vacancies07Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 194
195 7.2 Internal Energy
that the average kinetic energy of the atoms is directly proportional to the absolute tem-
perature. Kinetic theory thus gives us an insight into the signiﬁcance of two importantthermodynamical functions: temperature and pressure. Thermodynamics does not give usthis same ability to understand gas phenomena.
The third science of heat, statistical mechanics , applies the realm of statistics to heat
problems. Kinetic theory is concerned with the explanation of heat phenomena in termsof the mechanics of individual atoms. The mechanics of the disordered atomic motionsthat are ascribed to heat phenomena are attacked from probability considerations. Thisapproach is feasible because most practical problems involve quantities of matter contain-ing large numbers of atoms or molecules. It is thus possible to think in terms of the behav-ior of the group as a whole, as does a life insurance actuary who predicts the vital statisticsof a large population.
In one of the following sections, a physical interpretation will be given for the ther-
modynamical function called entropy . When approached from the point of view of statisti-
cal mechanics, this quantity is given a real signiﬁcance that is not apparent in classicalthermodynamics.
It should now be mentioned that thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are only
applicable to problems involving equilibrium, and cannot predict the speed of a chemicalor metallurgical reaction. This latter is the special province of the kinetic theory.
As a simple example of a system in equilibrium, consider a liquid metal and its equilib-
rium vapor in which the average number of metal atoms leaving the liquid to join the vaporequals the corresponding number traveling in the opposite direction. The concentration ofatoms in the vapor, and therefore the vapor pressure, is a constant with respect to time.Under conditions such as these, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are able toproduce much useful information; for example, how equilibrium-vapor pressure changeswith a change in temperature. Suppose, however, that liquid metal is placed inside the belljar of a vacuum system so that the vapor is swept away as fast as it forms. In this case, therecan be no equilibrium because atoms will leave the liquid at a much faster rate than theyreturn to it. Because the liquid-vapor system is no longer in equilibrium, thermodynamicsand statistical mechanics can no longer be used. Questions relating to how fast the metalatoms evaporate belong in the realm of the kinetic theory. Kinetic theory is thus most use-ful when the rates at which atomic changes take place are being studied.
7.2 INTERNAL ENERGY
The preceding paragraphs have discussed the interrelationships of the three branches of thescience of heat. The principal objective of this discussion was to show that physical mean-ings can be given to thermodynamical functions. Let us now consider a solid crystallinematerial. An important thermodynamical function that will be needed in the following sec-tions is internal energy , which shall be denoted by the symbol U. This quantity represents the
total kinetic and potential energy of all the atoms in a material body, or system. In the caseof crystals, a large part of this energy is associated with the vibration of the atoms in the lat-tice. Each atom can be assumed to vibrate about its rest position with three degrees of free-dom ( x, y, and zdirections). According to the Debye theory, the atoms do not vibrate
independent of each other, but rather as the result of random elastic waves traveling backand forth through the crystal, and, because they have three degrees of vibrational freedom,the lattice waves can be considered to be three independent sets of waves traveling alongthe x, y, and zaxes, respectively. When the temperature of the crystal is raised, the07Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 195

amplitudes of the elastic waves increase, with a corresponding increase in internal energy.
The intensity of the lattice vibrations is therefore a function of temperature.
7.3 ENTROPY
In thermodynamics, the entropy change, /H9004S, may be deﬁned by the following equation:
7.2
where SAis the entropy in state A, SBis the entropy in state B, Tis the absolute tempera-
ture, and dQis the heat added to system. The integration is assumed to be taken over a
reversible path between the two equilibrium states Aand B.
The entropy is a function of state; that is, it depends only on the state of the system. This
signiﬁes that the entropy difference ( SB/H11002SA) is independent of the way that the system is
carried from state Ato state B. If the system moves from Ato Bas a result of an irreversible
reaction, the entropy change is still ( SB/H11002SA). However, the entropy change equals the right-
hand side of Eq. 7.2 only if the path is reversible. Thus, to measure the entropy change of asystem (in going between states Aand B), one needs to integrate the quantity dQ/T over a
reversible path. The integral of this same quantity over an irreversible path does not equalthe entropy change. In fact, it is shown in all standard thermodynamical textbooks that

Differentiating the preceding two equations yields the following:

7.4 SPONTANEOUS REACTIONS
Consider the transformation of water from liquid to solid. The equilibrium temperature forthis reaction at atmospheric pressure is 0°C, by deﬁnition, which is approximately 273 K. Atthe equilibrium temperature, liquid water and ice can be maintained in the same isolatedcontainer for indeﬁnite periods of time as long as heat is neither added nor taken away fromthe system. Ice and water under these conditions furnish a good example of a system at equi-librium. Now, if heat is slowly applied to the container, some of the ice will melt and becomeliquid; or if heat is abstracted from the container, more ice will form at the expense of theliquid. In either case, a reversible exchange of heat (heat of fusion) between the liquid-solidsystem and its surroundings is necessary in order to change the ratio of liquid to solid. Thistransformation of liquid to solid at 0°C is an example of an equilibrium reaction.
Consider now the case of a thermally isolated container with liquid water that is
supercooled below the equilibrium freezing point (0°C). Even though ice may bethermally isolated from its surroundings, freezing can begin spontaneously withoutdS/H11022dQ

loss of heat to the surroundings. The heat of fusion, released by the portion of the
water that freezes, will, in this case, raise the temperature of the system back towardthe equilibrium freezing temperature. The difference between freezing at the equilib-rium freezing point and freezing at temperatures below it is an important one. In onecase, freezing occurs spontaneously; in the other, it is spontaneous only if the heat offusion is removed from the system. It should also be pointed out that the reversetransformation, in which ice melts at a temperature above the equilibrium freezingpoint, also occurs spontaneously. In this case, if the system is isolated (so that heatcannot be added to the system during the melting of the ice), the heat of fusion willcause the temperature to fall back toward the equilibrium temperature (0°C).
Reactions that occur spontaneously are always irreversible. Liquid water will
transform to ice at /H1100210°C ( /H11015263 K), but the reverse reaction is, of course, impossible.
Spontaneous reactions occur frequently in metallurgy, sometimes with drastic results,often with quite beneficial results. In either case, it is important to know the condi-tions that bring about spontaneous reactions, and to have a yardstick for measuringthe driving force of this type of reaction. The yardstick that is most valuable for thispurpose is called Gibbs free energy .
7.5 GIBBS FREE ENERGY
Gibbs free energy is deﬁned by the following equation:
G/H11005U/H11001PV/H11002TS 7.6
where Gis Gibbs free energy, Uis internal energy, Pis pressure, Vis volume, Tis absolute
temperature, and Sis entropy. The sum, U/H11001PV, in Eq. 7.6 is a combination that occurs
so often in relations dealing with systems at constant pressure that it has been designatedwith the special symbol Hand is called the enthalpy . Thus,
H/H11005U/H11001PV 7.7
Accordingly, Eq. 7.6 may be written
G/H11005H/H11002TS 7.8
where Gis the Gibbs free energy, Hthe enthalpy, Tthe temperature in degrees Kelvin, and
Sthe entropy.
Most metallurgical processes of interest such as freezing occur at constant pressure
(atmospheric). Furthermore, since we are primarily interested in solids and liquids, thevolume changes in metallurgical reactions are usually very small. As an illustrative exam-ple consider water in equilibrium with its solid form (ice). Let G
2be the free energy of a
mole of solid water (ice), and G1that of a mole of liquid water. When a mole of water
changes into ice, the free energy change is
/H9004G/H11005G2/H11002G1/H11005(H2/H11002TS2)/H11002(H1/H11002TS1) 7.9
where H2and H1are the enthalpies of the solid and liquid, respectively, S2and S1their
respective entropies, and Tthe temperature (which remains constant during the reaction).
Equation 7.9 may also be written
/H9004G/H11005/H9004H/H11002T/H9004S 7.1007Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 197

Water freezing to ice at the equilibrium freezing point, Te, is a reversible reaction, and
under these conditions we have seen that the entropy change is given by
7.11
which, in this case, reduces to
7.12
where /H9004Qis the latent heat of freezing for water. Also, by the ﬁrst law of thermody-
namics, we have
dU/H11005dW/H11001dQ 7.13
where dUis the change in internal energy, dWis the work done on system, and dQis the
heat added to system.
The ﬁrst law may also be written in terms of the enthalpy instead of the internal
energy. To do this ﬁrst take the derivative of H, which gives
dH/H11005dU/H11001PdV/H11001VdP 7.14
where at constant pressure VdPis by deﬁnition zero and PdVis equivalent to dWin
Eq. 7.13. However, in the freezing of water, the only external work that is done is against
the pressure of the atmosphere due to the expansion when water changes from liquid tosolid. This can be neglected because of its small size, so setting dWequal to zero, we obtain
dH/H11005dU/H11005/H9004Q 7.15
Substituting /H9004Sand /H9004Qin Eq. 7.8 for the free energy gives
7.16
The free-energy change in this reversible reaction (the freezing of water at 0°C) is zero. Itmay also be shown, with the aid of thermodynamics, that the Gibbs free-energy change iszero for any reversible reaction that takes place at constant temperature and pressure. Ifliquid water is now cooled to a temperature well below 273 K and allowed to freezeisothermally, the transformation will be made under irreversible conditions. But, in anirreversible reaction,

where /H9004Hagain equals /H9004Qas in the previous example. Therefore,
/H9004G/H11005/H9004Q/H11002T/H9004S 7.19
If T/H9004Sis greater than /H9004Q, however, /H9004Gmust be negative. This fact is important. The free-
energy change for this spontaneous reaction is negative, which means that the system
reacts so as to lower its free energy. This result is true not only in the above simple system,but also for all spontaneous reactions. A spontaneous reaction occurs when a system canlower its free energy.
While the free energy tells us whether or not a spontaneous reaction is possible, it
cannot predict the speed of the reaction. An excellent example of this fact can be seenin the case of the two phases of carbon—diamond and graphite. Graphite is the phasewith the lower free energy, and diamond should, therefore, transform spontaneouslyinto graphite. The rate is so slow, however, that there is no need to consider it. Rateproblems such as these are treated in the kinetic theory of matter and are not in therealm of thermodynamics.
7.6 STATISTICAL MECHANICAL DEFINITION OF ENTROPY
The significance of the entropy will now be considered. Let us take a two-chamberbox, each chamber filled with a different monatomic ideal gas. Gas Ais in chamber I,
and gas Bin chamber II. Let the partition between the chambers be removed and the
gases will mix by diffusion. Such mixing occurs at constant temperature and constantpressure if the gases have the same original temperature and pressure. No work isdone and no heat is transferred to or from the gases; therefore, the internal energy ofthe gaseous system does not change. This fact is in agreement with the law of conser-vation of energy (first law of thermodynamics), which is expressed in the followingequation:
dH/H11005dQ/H11001dW 7.20
dH/H110050 7.21
where dQ/H110050/H11005heat absorbed by the system (gases), dH/H11005change of the enthalpy
of the system (gases), dW/H110050/H11005work done on gases by the surroundings. A funda-
mental change in the system occurs as a result of the diffusion. That this is true canbe judged from the fact that considerable effort is required to separate this mixtureof gases into its components again. Like the freezing of water at temperatures below273 K, the mixing of gases is a spontaneous, or irreversible reaction, and, as in allirreversible reactions, the free energy must decrease. The free-energy equation statesthat
dG/H11005dH/H11002TdS 7.22
However, it was shown above that dHis zero and, therefore
dG/H11005/H11002 TdS 7.23
A decrease in free energy can only mean that dSmust be positive. In other words, the
entropy of the system has increased by the mixing of the gases. The entropy increase07Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 199
Chapter 7 Vacancies 200
involved in this reaction is known as an entropy of mixing . It is only one of a number of
forms of entropy. All forms, however, have one thing in common. When the entropy of a
system increases, the system becomes more disordered.
In the above example, a disorder in the spatial distribution of two kinds of gas
atoms has been considered, but entropy can also be associated with disorder in themotion of atoms, with respect to the directions and the magnitudes of the velocities ofthe atoms.
As a hypothetical example, let us consider that it is possible to introduce gas mol-
ecules into a chamber in such a manner that all of them begin to travel in the samedirection and with the same speed back and forth between two opposite walls of thebox. Collisions of the molecules with each other and with the walls quickly bringabout a random distribution in the directions and magnitudes of the molecular veloc-ities. An increase in entropy necessarily accompanies this irreversible change fromuniformly ordered motion to random motion. The question now arises: why do twounmixed gases seek a random distribution? The answer lies in the fact that, onremoval of the partition, each gas atom is free to move through both compartmentsand has equal probability of being found in either. Once the barrier has beenremoved, the probability is extremely small that all of the Aatoms will be found in
compartment Aand, at the same time, all of the Batoms in compartment B.
Furthermore, the probability of the atoms maintaining such segregation is even moreremote. On the other hand, the chance of finding a random distribution throughoutthe box is almost a certainty.
Since a shift from a state of low probability (two unmixed gases in contact) to a state
of high probability (random mixture) accompanies an entropy increase, it would appearthat there is a close relationship between entropy and probability. This relationship doesexist and was ﬁrst expressed mathematically by Boltzmann, who introduced the followingequation:
S/H11005kln P 7.24
where Sis the entropy of a system in a given state, Pis the probability of the state, and k
is Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 /H1100310/H1100223joules/deg (K)).
The change in entropy (mixing entropy) resulting from the mixing of gas Aand gas B
may be expressed in terms of the Boltzmann equation:
/H9004S/H11005S2/H11002S1/H11005kln P2/H11002kln P17.25
7.26
where S1is the entropy of unmixed gases, S2is the entropy of mixed gases, P1is the
probability of unmixed state, and P2is the probability of mixed state.
The probability of ﬁnding the atoms in the unmixed, or segregated, state is computed
as follows:
Let VA/H11005the volume originally occupied by the atoms of gas A
VB/H11005the volume originally occupied by the atoms of gas B
V/H11005the total volume of the box/H9004S/H11005k ln P2

201 7.6 Statistical Mechanical Deﬁnition of Entropy
If one Aatom is introduced into the undivided box, the probability of ﬁnding it in VAis
VA/V. If a second Aatom is now added to the box, the chance of ﬁnding both at the same
time in VAis (VA/V)/H11003(VA/V). This problem is similar to that of producing two heads on
the toss of a pair of coins, where the chance of a head on either coin is 1/2, but for the pair
it is 1/2 /H110031/2/H110051/4. A third Aatom reduces the probability of ﬁnding all Aatoms in VA
to (VA/V)3, and if nAis the total number of atoms of gas A, the probability of ﬁnding all nA
in VAis . Now if an atom of Bis added to the box, the chance of ﬁnding it in VB
is (VB/V), and the chance of ﬁnding it in VB, and at the same time ﬁnding all the Aatoms
in VA, is /H11003(VB/V). Finally, the probability of ﬁnding all atoms of gas Ain VA,

where nAis the number of Aatoms, and nBis the number of Batoms.
It is now necessary to consider the probability of the homogeneous mixture. Thought
must ﬁrst be given to the meaning of the term homogeneous mixture . A very accurate exper-
imental analysis might possibly be able to detect a variation in composition of the mixtureof the order of one part in 10
10, but be unable to detect a smaller variation. Therefore, an
experimentally homogeneous mixture is not one with a perfectly constant ratio of Ato B
atoms, but one with a ratio that does not vary sufﬁciently from the mean value to bedetectable. Such a mixture is extremely probable when the number of atoms is large, asin most real systems, where the number usually exceeds 10
20(approximately 10/H110023moles).
The importance of large numbers in statistics can easily be seen in a somewhat analogouscase: that of ﬂipping coins and counting the number that come “heads up.” If 10 coins aretossed together, it may be shown that the chance of getting 5 heads is 0.246, while that ofobtaining any of the numbers in the group of 4, 5, or 6 heads is 0.666. Thus, even with10 coins, it is apparent that a number close to the mean distribution is quite probable. Ifthe number of tossed coins is increased to 100, the probability of ﬁnding somewherebetween 40 and 60 heads is 0.95. Increasing the number of coins by one factor of10 clearly increases the probability of ﬁnding a distribution near the mean. Finally, let usincrease the number of coins to approximately that found in a real system of atoms (10
20).
In this case, the mean distribution is 5 /H110031019heads. The probability of ﬁnding a number
of heads within 3.5 parts in 1010of this number is 0.999999999997. In other words, sta-
tistics tells us that the chance of ﬁnding between
50,000,000,035,000,000,000
and
49,999,999,965,000,000,000
heads is within 3 parts in 1012of unity. It also tells us that the chance of ﬁnding a distri-
bution containing a number of heads that lies outside the above range is just about nil.
Consider again the box containing the mixture of Aand Bgas atoms. The chance of
ﬁnding a head on the ﬂip of a coin is exactly analogous to the chance of ﬁnding an Aatom
in one half of the box. It is also analogous to the chance of ﬁnding a Batom in the same
half. It can be concluded, therefore, that both atom forms, when present in very largenumbers, will seek a mean distribution in which the atoms are uniformly distributed inP1/H11005/H20898VA

experimentally homogeneous mixture extremely high. It can be assumed, for the purposesof calculation, that this probability is equal to one.
Returning to the mixing-entropy equation given in Eq. 7.26, and based on the above
considerations, P
2can be taken as unity. Thus,
Substituting for P1from Eq. 7.27 results in

Metal crystals are never perfect. It is now well understood that they may contain many
defects. These are classiﬁed according to a few important types. One of the most impor-
tant is called a vacancy . The existence of vacancies in crystals was originally postulated
to explain solid-state diffusion in crystals. Because of the mobility of gas atoms and
molecules, gaseous diffusion is easy to comprehend, but the movement of atoms inside
crystals is more difﬁcult to grasp. Still, it is a well known fact that two metals, for
example, nickel and copper, will diffuse into each other if placed in intimate contact
and heated to a high temperature. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain
these diffusion phenomena, but the most generally acceptable has been the vacancy
mechanism.
Diffusion in crystals is explained, in terms of vacancies, by assuming that the
vacancies move through the lattice, thereby producing random shifts of the atoms
from one lattice position to another. The basic principle of vacancy diffusion is illus-
trated in Fig 7.1, where three successive steps in the movement of a vacancy from
position I to II are shown. In each case, it can be seen that the vacancy moves as a
result of an atom jumping into a hole from a lattice position bordering the hole.
In order to make the jump, the atom must overcome the net attractive force of its
neighbors on the side opposite the hole. Work is therefore required to make the jumpk/H11005R

Chapter 7 Vacancies 204
into the hole, or, as it may also be stated, an energy barrier must be overcome. Energy
sufficient to overcome the barrier is furnished by the thermal or heat vibrations of the
crystal lattice. The higher the temperature, the more intense the thermal vibrations,
and the more frequently are the energy barriers overcome. Vacancy motion at high
temperatures is very rapid and, as a consequence, the rate of diffusion increases
rapidly with increasing temperature. An equation will now be derived that gives the
equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a crystal as a function of temperature.
Let us assume that in a crystal containing n0atoms there are nyvacant lattice
sites. The total number of lattice sites is, accordingly, n0/H11001nn, or the sum of the occu-
pied and unoccupied positions. Suppose that vacancies are created by movements of
atoms from positions inside the crystal to positions on the surface of the crystal, in
the manner shown in Fig. 7.2. When a vacancy has been formed in this manner, a
Schottky defect is said to have been formed. Let the work required to form a Schottky
defect be represented by the symbol w. A crystal containing nnvacancies will there-
fore have an internal energy greater than that of a crystal without vacancies by an
amount nnw.
The free energy of a crystal containing vacancics will be different from that of a crys-
tal free of vacancies. This free-energy increment may be written as follows:
Gv/H11005Hv/H11002TSv7.33
where Gvis the free energy due to vacancies, Hvis the enthalpy increase due to the vacan-
cies, and Svis the entropy due to the vacancies.
But, according to the above,
Hv/H11005nvw
and thus
Gv/H11005nvw/H11002TSv7.34
Now the entropy of the crystal is increased in the presence of vacancies for two rea-
sons. First, the atoms adjacent to each hole are less restrained than those completely sur-
rounded by other atoms and can, therefore, vibrate in a more irregular or random fashion
than the atoms removed from the hole. Each vacancy contributes a small amount to the
total entropy of the crystal.
Let us designate the vibrational entropy associated with one vacancy by the sym-
bol s. The total increase in entropy arising from this source is nvs, where nvis the total

number of vacancies. While a consideration of this vibrational entropy is important in
a thorough theoretical treatment of vacancies, it will be omitted in our present
calculations because its effect on the number of vacancies present in the crystal is of
secondary importance.
The other entropy form arising in the presence of vacancies is an entropy of mixing . The
entropy of mixing has already been derived for the mixing of two ideal gases, and is
expressed by the equation
Sm/H11005/H9004S/H11005/H11002 nk[XAln XA/H11001(1/H11002XA) ln (1 /H11002XA)] 7.35
where Smis the mixing entropy, nis the total number of atoms ( nA/H11001nB), kis the
Boltzmann’s constant, XAis the concentration of atom A/H11005nA/n, and (1 /H11002XA) is the con-
centration of atom B/H11005nB/n. The above equation applies directly to the present problem
if we consider mixing of lattice points, instead of atoms, in which there are two types of
lattice points: one occupied by atoms, the other unoccupied. If there are nooccupied sites
and nvunoccupied, the unmixed state will correspond to one in which a lattice of no/H11001nv
sites has all positions on one side ﬁlled and all on the other empty. This is equivalent to a
box problem, shown schematically in Fig. 7.3A, in which there are two compartments,
one ﬁlled with occupied lattice positions and the other ﬁlled with empty positions. The
corresponding mixed state in the box is shown in Fig. 7.3B.
The present problem consists of mixing noobjects of one kind with nvof another kind,
with a total number ( no/H11001nv) to be mixed. Therefore, we may make the following substi-
tutions in the mixing-entropy equation:

This free energy must be a minimum if the crystal is in equilibrium; that is, the number of
vacancies ( nv) in the crystal will seek the value that makes Gva minimum at any given
temperature. As a result, the derivative of Gvwith respect to nvmust equal zero with the
temperature being held constant. Thus,

In general, it has been found that the number of vacancies in a metal crystal is very
small when compared with the number of atoms (the number of occupied sites no).
Therefore Eq. 7.38 can be written in terms of nv/H20862no, the ratio of vacancies to atoms in the
crystal.

The experimental value for the activation enthalpy for the formation of vacancies in
copper is approximately 83,700 joules per mole of vacancies. This value may be substituted
into Eq. 7.40 in an attempt to determine the effect of temperature on the number ofvacancies. Remembering that R/H110158.37 joules per mole /H11002K,
At absolute zero the equilibrium number of vacancies should be zero, for in this case
At 300 K, approximately room temperatureHowever, at 1350 K, six degrees below melting point,Therefore, just below the melting point there is approximately one vacancy for every
1000 atoms. While at first glance this appears to be a very small number, the meandistance between vacancies is only about 10 atoms. On the other hand, the room-temperature equilibrium concentration of vacancies (4.45 /H1100310
/H1100215) corresponds to a
mean separation between vacancies of the order of 100,000 atoms. These figuresshow clearly the strong effect of temperature on the number of vacancies.
Two questions need to be considered: ﬁrst, why should there be an equilibrium num-
ber of vacancies at a given temperature, and, second, why does the equilibrium numberchange with temperature? Figure 7.4 answers the ﬁrst of these questions in terms ofcurves of the functions G
v, nvw, and /H11002TSmas functions of the number of vacancies nv. In
this ﬁgure, the temperature is assumed close to the melting point. Whereas the work toform vacancies ( n
vw) increases linearly with the number of vacancies, at low concentra-
tions the entropy component ( /H11002TS) increases very rapidly with nv, but less and less rap-
idly as nvgrows larger. At the value marked n1in the ﬁgure, the two quantities nvwand
/H11002TSbecome equal, and, at this point, the free energy Gv, the sum of ( nvw/H11002TS), equals
zero. For all values of nvgreater than n1, the free energy is positive, and for all values ofnv

This is the equilibrium concentration of vacancies.
Figure 7.4 shows a second set of dashed line curves for a lower-temperature curves
(TB/H11021TA). The lowering of the temperature does not change the nvwcurve, but makes all
ordinates of the /H11002TScurve smaller in the ratio TB/H20862TA. As a result, both n1and neof the
free-energy curve ( Gv) are shifted to the left. Thus, with decreasing temperature, the equi-
librium number of vacancies becomes smaller because the entropy component ( /H11002TS)
decreases.
It should be noted that Eq. 7.40 was derived assuming that the vibrational entropy
contribution is negligible. When the entropy is included, a similar derivation would show
the equilibrium vacancy concentration, Xc, as
7.41
where Hvand Svare the enthalpy and entropy of formation of a single vacancy, respec-
tively. The above equation, called the Arrenhius law, when plotted as ln Xcversus 1/T
would give a straight line. The slope of the line is /H11002Hv/H20862k, whereas its intercept with the
Yaxis would give Sv/H20862k. Such a plot can be used to determine the enthalpy and entropy
of vacancy formation.
The most direct method of determination of the equilibrium vacancy concentra-
tion involves measurement of the actual linear thermal expansion coefficient ( /H9004L/L)
and the lattice parameter expansion coefficient ( /H9004a/a) by X-ray techniques at high
temperatures.1The measured thermal expansion contains two components: one due
to the increase of the lattice constant with temperature and the other due to the
increase in the number of lattice sites as vacancies are produced. As such, the differ-
ence between the two coefficients can be used to determine the vacancy concentra-
tion. Other techniques, such as quenching of the sample to low temperatures such
that vacancies are immobile and positron-annihilation spectroscopy have also beenXc/H11005n v

7.8 VACANCY MOTION
We have determined that the equilibrium ratio of vacancies to atoms at a given tempera-
ture Tis given by Eq. 7.40 or 7.41.
Nothing, however, has been said about the time required to attain an equilibrium
number of vacancies. This may be very long at low temperatures or very rapid at high tem-
peratures. Since the movement of vacancies is caused by successive jumps of atoms into
vacancies, a study of the fundamental law governing the jumps is important. It was men-
tioned earlier that an energy barrier, shown schematically in Fig. 7.5, must be overcome07Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 209
Chapter 7 Vacancies 210
when a jump is made, and that the required energy is supplied by the thermal, or heat,
vibrations of the crystal.
If qois the height of the energy barrier that an atom, such as atom ain Fig. 7.5, must
overcome in order to jump into a vacancy, then the jump can only occur if atom apos-
sesses vibrational energy greater than qo. Conversely, if the vibrational energy is lower
than qo, the jump cannot occur. The chance that a given atom possesses an energy greater
than qohas been found to be proportional to the function , or
p/H11005const 7.42
where pis the probability that an atom possesses an energy equal to or greater than a
given energy qo, kis Boltzmann’s constant, and Tis the absolute temperature. Equation
7.42 was originally derived for the energy distribution of atoms in a perfect gas (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution). However, this same function has also been found to predictquite accurately the vibrational energy distribution of the atoms in a crystalline solid.
Since the above function is the probability that a given atom has an energy greater
than that required for a jump, the probability of jumping must be proportional to thisfunction. Therefore, we can write the following equation:
rv/H11005 7.43
where rvis the number of atom jumps per second into a vacancy, Ais a constant, qois the
activation energy per atom (height of the energy barrier), and kand Thave the usual sig-
niﬁcance. If the numerator and denominator of the exponent in Eq. 7.43 are both multi-plied by N, Avogadro’s number 6.02 /H1100310
23, we have
rv/H11005 7.44
where Hmis the activation enthalpy for the movement of vacancies in joules per mole, and
Rthe gas constant (8.31 J per mole K).
The constant Ain Eq. 7.44 depends on a number of factors. Among these is the num-
ber of atoms bordering the hole. The larger the number of atoms able to jump, the greaterthe frequency of jumping. A second factor is the vibration frequency of the atoms. Thehigher the rate of vibration, the more times per second an atom approaches the hole, andthe greater is its chance of making a jump.
Let us consider Eq. 7.44 with respect to an actual metal. The value of Afor copper is
approximately 10
15, and the activation enthalpy Hm/H11005121 KJ per mole. If these values
are substituted into the jump-rate equation, we have at 1350 K (just below melting pointof copper)
at 300 K (room temperature)
The tremendous difference in the rate with which vacancies move near the melting
point, compared with their rate at room temperature, is quite apparent. In one second at
1350 K the vacancy moves approximately 30 billion times, while at room temperature atime interval of about 10
6sec, or 11 days, occurs between jumps.rv/H1122910/H110026 jumps/srv/H112292/H110031010 jumps/sAe/H11002Hm/H20862RTAe/H11002qo/H20862kTe/H11002qo/H20862kTe/H11002qo/H20862kT07Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 210
211 7.9 Interstitial Atoms and Divacancies
While the jump rate of vacancies is of some importance, we are really more interested
in how many jumps the average atom makes per second when the crystal contains an
equilibrium number of vacancies. This quantity equals the fractional ratio of vacancies toatoms n
v/H20862notimes the number of jumps per second into one vacancy, or
where rais the number of jumps per second made by an atom, nvis the number of vacan-
cies, nothe number of atoms. However, we have seen that
7.45
where Hfis the activation enthalpy for the formation of vacancies. Therefore,
ra/H11005/H11003 /H11005 7.46
The rate at which an atom jumps, or moves from place to place in a crystal, thus
depends on two energies: Hf, the work to form a mole of vacancies, and Hm, the energy bar-
rier that must be overcome in order to move a mole of atoms into vacancies. Since the twoenergies are additive, the atomic jump rate is extremely sensitive to temperature. This laststatement can be made in a different form. It has previously been shown that in copper theratio of vacancies to atoms is about one to a thousand at 1350 K, while at 300 K, the ratiois one to approximately 5 /H1100310
15, a decrease by a factor of about 1012. During the same
temperature interval, the number of jumps per second into a vacancy decreases by a factorof approximately 10
16. Between the melting point and room temperature, the average rate
of atomic movement thus decreases by a factor of about 1028. From a more simple point of
view, at 1350 K the vacancies in copper are approximately 10 atoms apart, and atoms jumpinto these vacancies at the rate of about 30 billion jumps per second; at 300 K the vacan-cies are 100,000 atoms apart, and atoms jump into them at the rate of one jump in 11 days.
The above discussion leads to one ﬁrm conclusion: those physical properties of copper
that can be changed through diffusion of copper atoms can be considered unchangeableat room temperature.
Similar conclusions can be drawn for other metals, but the degree of change will
depend upon the metal in question. For example, vacancies in lead at room temperaturemay be shown, by calculations similar to the above, to jump at a rate of approximately22 jumps per second, with a mean spacing between vacancies of about 100 atoms.Appreciable atomic diffusion therefore occurs in lead at room temperature.
7.9 INTERSTITIAL ATOMS AND DIVACANCIES
Next to a vacancy, the most important point defects in a metal crystal are an interstitial atom
and a divacancy . Let us brieﬂy consider the ﬁrst of these.
An interstitial atom is one that occupies a place in a crystal that normally would be
unoccupied. Such places are the holes or interstitial positions that occur between theatoms lying on the normal lattice sites. Such a hole occurs even in the close-packed face-centered cubic lattice at the center of the unit cell, as indicated in Fig. 7.6. An equivalenthole exists between any pair of atoms lying at the corners of the unit cell. The holeAe/H11002(Hm/H11001Hf)/H20862RTe/H11002Hf/H20862RTAe/H11002Hm/H20862RTnv

cubic crystal. A site is sorrounded by four
atoms (tetrahedral site), whereas B site is
sorrounded by six atoms
between the two corner atoms along the right-hand front vertical edge of the cell is
indicated in Fig. 7.6.
It is necessary to differentiate between two basically different types of atoms that can
occupy these interstitial sites. The ﬁrst of these is composed of atoms whose sizes are small,
such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Atoms of this type can sometimes occupy
a small fraction of the interstitial sites in a metal. When this occurs, it is said to be an inter-
stitial solid solution. (This subject is considered further in Chapter 9.) The other type of
interstitial atom is our present concern: this consists of an atom that would normally
occupy a regular lattice site. In the case of a pure metal like copper, such an interstitial
atom would be a copper atom. The hard-ball model of the {100} plane of an fcc crystal in
Fig. 7.7 clearly shows that the interstitial sites are too small to hold such a large atom with-
out badly distorting the lattice. As a consequence, while the activation energy to form
vacancies in copper is a little less than 1 eV, that for the formation of interstitital copper
atoms is probably about 4 eV. This difference in activation energy means that interstitial
atoms produced by thermal vibrations should be very rare in a metal such as copper. This
can easily be shown by a computation using the same form of equation as that developed
earlier in this chapter to compute the equilibrium ratio of vacancies to atoms.

FIG. 7.8 The conﬁguration when an interstitial atom can
move readily through the crystalWhile interstitial defects of the type under consideration do not normally exist in
sufﬁcient concentrations in a metal to be signiﬁcant, they can be readily produced in metals
as a result of radiation damage. Collisions between fast neutrons and a metal can result in
knocking atoms out of their normal lattice sites. The removal of an atom from its lattice posi-
tion, of course, produces both an interstitial atom and a vacancy. It has been estimated6that
each fast neutron can result in the creation of about 100–200 interstitials and vacancies.
While it is very difﬁcult to create an interstitial defect of the type presently being con-
sidered, they are very mobile once they are produced. The energy barrier for their motion
is small and, in the case of copper, it has been estimated7to be of the order of 0.1 eV. The
reason for this high mobility is shown in Fig. 7.8. In this ﬁgure it is assumed that one
is observing the {100} plane of an fcc crystal. In Fig. 7.8A the interstitial atom is shown as
a shaded circle and is designated by the symbol a. Suppose that this atom were to move07Ch07.qxd  11/6/08  3:35 PM  Page 213
Chapter 7 Vacancies 214
to the right. This motion would push atom binto an interstitial position, as shown in
Fig. 7.8B. In this process atom awould return to a normal lattice site. Further motion of b
in the same direction would make an interstitial atom out of c. By this type of motion, the
conﬁguration associated with an interstitial atom can readily move through the lattice.
Any given interstitial atom only moves a small distance, and because the distortion of thelattice is severe around the interstitial atom, this type of motion requires little energy. Theeffect of the lattice distortion around the defect in making the motion easier is exactlyequivalent to that observed in the motion of dislocations.
If a pair of vacancies combine to make a single point defect, a divacancy is said to be
created. It is difﬁcult to estimate or measure the binding energy of this type of defect. Onecalculation,
8however, places it at about 0.3–0.4 eV in the case of copper. In a metal where
the vacancies and divacancies are in equilibrium, one can approximately compute6the
ratio of divacancies to vacancies using the equation

2168.1 STORED ENERGY OF COLD WORK
When a metal is plastically deformed at temperatures that are low relative to its melting
point, it is said to be cold worked . The temperature deﬁning the upper limit of the cold
working range cannot be expressed exactly, for it varies with composition as well as the
rate and the amount of deformation. A rough rule-of-thumb is to assume that plastic
deformation corresponds to cold working if it is carried out at temperatures lower than
one-half of the melting point measured on an absolute scale.
Most of the energy expended in cold work appears in the form of heat, but a ﬁnite
fraction is stored in the metal as strain energy associated with various lattice defects
created by the deformation. The amount of energy retained depends on the deforma-
tion process and a number of other variables, for example, composition of the metal as
well as the rate and temperature of deformation. A number of investigators have indi-
cated that the fraction of the energy that remains in the metal varies from a low per-
centage to somewhat over 10 percent. Figure 8.1 shows the relationship between the
stored energy and the amount of deformation in a speciﬁc metal (polycrystalline
99.999 percent pure copper) for a speciﬁc type of deformation (tensile strain). The data,
from the work of Gordon,1show that the stored energy increases with increasing
deformation, but at a decreasing rate, so that the fraction of the total energy stored
decreases with increasing deformation. The latter effect is shown by a second curve
plotted in Fig. 8.1.
The maximum value of the stored energy in Fig. 8.1 is only 6 cal (25 J) per mole,
which represents the strain energy left in a very pure metal after a moderate deformation
(30 percent extension) at room temperature. The amount of stored energy can be greatly

increased by increasing the severity of the deformation, lowering the deformation
temperature, and by changing the pure metal to an alloy. Thus, metal chips formed bydrilling an alloy (82.6 percent Au–17.4 percent Ag) at the temperature of liquid nitrogenare reported
2to have a stored-energy content of 200 cal (837 J) per mole.
Let us consider the nature of the stored energy of plastic deformation. Cold work-
ing is known to increase greatly the number of dislocations in a metal. A soft annealedmetal can have dislocation densities of the order of 10
10to 1012m/H110022, and heavily
cold-worked metals can have approximately 1016. Accordingly, cold working is able to
increase the number of dislocations in a metal by a factor as large as 10,000 to1,000,000. Since each dislocation represents a crystal defect with an associated latticestrain, increasing the dislocation density increases the strain energy of the metal.
The creation of point defects during plastic deformation is also recognized as a source
of retained energy in cold-worked metals. One mechanism for the creation of point defectsin a crystal has already been described. In Sec. 4.9 it was mentioned that a screw disloca-tion that cuts another screw dislocation may be capable of generating a close-packed rowof either vacancies or interstitials as it glides, with the type of point defect produceddepending on the relative Burgers vectors of the intersecting dislocations. Since the strainenergy associated with a vacancy is much smaller than that associated with an interstitialatom, it can be assumed that vacancies will be formed in greater numbers than interstitialatoms during plastic deformation.
8.2 THE RELATIONSHIP OF FREE ENERGY TO STRAIN ENERGY
The free energy of deformed metal is greater than that of an annealed metal by anamount approximately equal to the stored strain energy. While plastic deformationcertainly increases the entropy of a metal, the effect is small compared to the increase ininternal energy (the retained strain energy). The term /H11002T/H9004Sin the free-energy equation
may, therefore, be neglected and the free-energy increase equated directly to the storedenergy. Therefore,
/H9004G/H11005/H9004H/H11002T/H9004S
becomes
/H9004G/H11015/H9004H 8.1
where /H9004Gis the free energy associated with the cold work, /H9004His the enthalpy, or
stored strain energy, Sis the entropy increase due to the cold work, and Tis the
absolute temperature.
Since the free energy of cold-worked metals is greater than that of annealed met-
als, they may soften spontaneously. A metal does not usually return to the annealedcondition by a single simple reaction because of the complexity of the cold-workedstate. A number of different reactions occur, the total effect of which is the regainingof a condition equivalent to that possessed by the metal before it was cold worked.Many of these reactions involve some form of atom, or vacancy, movement and are,therefore, extremely temperature sensitive. The reaction rates of these reactions mayusually be expressed as simple exponential laws similar to that previously written forvacancy movement. Heating a deformed metal, therefore, greatly speeds up its returnto the softened state.08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:32 PM  Page 217
Chapter 8 Annealing 218
8.3 THE RELEASE OF STORED ENERGY
Valuable information about the nature of the reactions that occur as a cold-worked metal
returns to its original state may be obtained through a study of the release of its stored
energy. There are several basically different methods of accomplishing this. Two of the
more important will now be brieﬂy indicated. In the ﬁrst, the anisothermal anneal method,
the cold-worked metal is heated continuously from a lower to a higher temperature and
the energy release is determined as a function of temperature. One form of the anisother-
mal anneal measures the difference in the power required to heat two similar specimens
at the same rate. One specimen of the two is cold worked before the heating cycle, while
the other serves as a standard and is not deformed. During the heating cycle, the cold-
worked specimen undergoes reactions that release heat and lower the power required to
heat it in comparison with that required to heat the standard specimen. Measurements of
the difference in power give direct evidence of the rate at which heat is released in the
cold-worked specimen. Figure 8.2 shows a typical anisothermal anneal curve for a com-
mercially pure copper (99.97 percent copper).3It is noteworthy that some heat is released
at temperatures only slightly above room temperature. The signiﬁcance of this, and of the
pronounced maximum that appears in the curve, will be discussed presently.
The other method of studying energy release involves isothermal annealing . Here
the energy is measured while the specimen is maintained at a constant temperature.
Figure 8.3 is representative of the type of curves obtained in an isothermal anneal.
The data for this particular curve were obtained with the aid of a microcalorimeter
with a sensitivity capable of measuring a heat flow as low as 13 mJ per hr.
Both the anisothermal anneal and the isothermal anneal curves of Figs. 8.2 and 8.3
show maxima corresponding to large energy releases. Metallographic specimens prepared
from samples annealed by either method show that an interesting phenomenon occurs in

219 8.3 The Release of Stored Energy
the region of maximum energy release. These large energy releases appear simultaneously
with the growth of an entirely new set of essentially strain-free grains, which grow at the
expense of the original badly deformed grains. The process by which this occurs is called
recrystallization and may be understood as a realignment of the atoms into crystals with a
lower free energy.
While the major energy release of the curves of Figs. 8.2 and 8.3 correspond to
recrystallization, both curves show that energy is released before recrystallization. In this
regard, dashed lines have been drawn schematically on both curves in order to delineate
the recrystallization portion of the energy release. The area under each solid curve that
lies to the left and above the dashed lines represents an energy release not associated with
recrystallization. In the anisothermal anneal curve, this freeing of strain energy starts at
temperatures well below those at which recrystallization starts. Similarly, in the isother-
mal anneal curve it begins at the start of the annealing cycle and is nearly completed
before recrystallization starts. The part of the annealing cycle that occurs before recrystal-
lization is called recovery . It should be recognized, however, that the reactions that occur
during the recovery stages are able to continue during the progress of recrystallization;
not in those regions that have already recrystallized, but in those that have not yet been
converted into new grains. Recovery reactions will be described in the next section. First,
however, it is necessary to deﬁne the third stage of annealing— grain growth . Grain growth
occurs when annealing is continued after recrystallization has been completed. In grain
growth, certain of the recrystallized grains continue to grow in size, but only at the
expense of other crystals which must, accordingly, disappear.
The release of stored energy in cold-rolled high-purity iron, measured by Scholz
et al.4using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), is shown in Fig. 8.4. The DSC
measurements were conducted with a heating rate of 20 K/min from 40 to 650°C. In
this ﬁgure, where the heat generation by the metal shows as a negative deviation in the
heat ﬂow curve, after the initial transient peak below 100°C, a broad exothermic peak
extending from about 100 to 280°C can be seen. This broad exothermic peak is followed
by a larger one extending from about 300 to 480°C. The energy released in these two
peaks has been calculated by the authors as 3.9 and 15.1 J/mol, corresponding to
19 J/mol for the total stored energy. The changes in the microstructure of the cold-rolled
iron during heating, revealed by interrupted quenching, are shown in Figs. 8.5A–F.
As can be seen, the deformed structure is retained up to 300°C, but new grains form as
the metal is heated further. The new-formed grains can be clearly seen as isolated
spots in Fig. 8.5C, while other regions still show the deformed microstructure.

At 460°C (Fig. 8.5E), most of the deformed regions have been replaced by new grains
which grow considerably larger at the higher temperature, as seen in Fig. 8.5F.
The three stages of annealing—recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth—have
now been deﬁned. Some of the important aspects of each will now be considered.
8.4 RECOVERY
When a metal is cold worked, changes occur in almost all of its physical and mechanical
properties. Working increases strength, hardness, and electrical resistance, and it decreases
ductility. Furthermore, when plastically deformed metal is studied using X-ray diffraction
techniques, the X-ray reﬂections become characteristic of the cold-worked state. Laue pat-
terns of deformed single crystals show pronounced asterism corresponding to lattice cur-
vatures. Similarly, Debye-Scherrer photographs of deformed polycrystalline metal exhibit08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:32 PM  Page 220
221 8.5 Recovery in Single Crystals
diffraction lines that are not sharp, but broadened, in agreement with the complicated
nature of the residual stresses and deformations that remain in a polycrystalline metal
following cold working.
In the recovery stage of annealing, the physical and mechanical properties that suf-
fered changes as a result of cold working tend to recover their original values. For many
years, the fact that hardness and other properties could be altered without an apparent
change in the microstructure, as signiﬁed by recrystallization, was regarded as a mystery.
That the various physical and mechanical properties do not recover their values at the
same rate is indicative of the complicated nature of the recovery process. Figure 8.6
shows another anisothermal anneal curve corresponding to the energy released on
heating cold-worked polycrystalline nickel.3The peak at point cdeﬁnes the region of
recrystallization. The fraction of the energy released during recovery in this metal is
much larger than that in the example of Fig. 8.2. Plotted on the same diagram are curves
indicating the change in electrical resistivity and hardness as a function of the anneal-
ing temperature. Notice that the resistivity is almost completely recovered before the
state of recrystallization. On the other hand, the major change in the hardness occurs
simultaneously with recrystallization of the matrix.
8.5 RECOVERY IN SINGLE CRYSTALS
The complexity of the cold-worked state is directly related to the complexity of the deforma-
tion that produces it. Thus, the lattice distortions are simpler in a single crystal deformed by
easy glide than in a single crystal deformed by multiple glide (simultaneous slip on several
systems), and lattice distortions may be still more severe in a polycrystalline metal.
If a single crystal is deformed by easy glide (slip on a single plane) in a manner that
does not bend the lattice, it is quite possible to completely recover its hardness without
recrystallization of the specimen. In fact, it is generally impossible to recrystallize a crystal0.4

deformed only by easy glide, even if it is heated to temperatures as high as the melting
point. Figure 8.7 shows schematically a stress-strain curve for a zinc single crystal strained
in tension at room temperature where it deforms by basal slip.
Let us suppose that the crystal was originally loaded to point aand then the load
was removed. If the load is reapplied after only a short rest period (about half a minute),
it will not yield plastically until the stress almost reaches the value attained just before
the load was removed on the ﬁrst cycle. There is, however, a deﬁnite decrease in the
stress at which the crystal begins to ﬂow the second time. This ﬂow-stress would only
equal that attained at the end of the previous loading cycle if it could be unloaded and
reloaded without loss of time. Recovery of the yield point thus begins very rapidly. The
yield point can be completely recovered in a zinc crystal at room temperature in a period
of a day. This is shown by the third loading cycle in Fig. 8.7. These stress-strain diagrams
indicate a well known fact: the rate at which a property recovers isothermally is a
decreasing function of the time. Figure 8.8 illustrates this effect graphically by plotting
the yield point of deformed zinc crystals as a function of the time for several different
recovery temperatures. In this case the crystals were plastically deformed by easy glide
at 223 K and isothermally annealed at the indicated temperatures. Notice that the rate
of recovery is much faster at 283 K than it is at 253 K. This conﬁrms our previous obser-
vations of the effect in temperature on the rate of recovery. In fact, the recovery in zinc
crystals deformed by simple glide can be expressed in terms of a simple activation, or
Arrhenius-type law, of the form

8.6 POLYGONIZATION
Recovery associated with a simple form of plastic deformation has been considered in the
preceding section. Recovery in this case is probably a matter of annihilating excess disloca-
tions. Such annihilation can occur by the coming together of dislocation segments of oppo-
site sign (that is, negative edges with positive edges and left-hand screws with right-hand
screws). In this process it is probable that both slip and climb mechanisms are involved.τ1/H110055e/H1100283,140

Chapter 8 Annealing 224
Another recovery process is called polygonization . In its simplest form it is associated
with crystals that have been plastically bent. Because the X-ray beam is reﬂected from
curved planes, bent crystals give Laue photographs with elongated, or asterated, spots.
(See Chapter 2.) Many workers have shown that the Laue spots of bent crystals assume a
ﬁne structure after a recovery anneal (an anneal that does not recrystallize the specimen).
This is shown schematically in Fig. 8.9, where the left-hand ﬁgure represents the Laue 
pattern of a bent crystal before annealing, and the right-hand ﬁgure the pattern after
annealing. Each of the elongated, or asterated spots of the deformed crystal is replaced by
a set of tiny sharp reﬂections in the annealed crystal.
In a Laue photograph, each spot corresponds to the reﬂection from a speciﬁc lattice
plane. When a single crystal is exposed to the X-ray beam of a Laue camera, a ﬁnite
number of spots is obtained with a pattern on the ﬁlm characteristic of the crystal and
its orientation. If a Laue beam straddles the boundary between two crystals, a double
pattern of spots is observed, each characteristic of the orientation of its respective crys-
tal. Furthermore, if the two crystals have nearly identical orientations, as is the case
when the boundary is a low-angle boundary or low-energy dislocation structure (i.e.,
LEDS; see Sec. 6.6), the two patterns will almost coincide, and the photograph will show
a set of closely spaced double spots. Finally, if the X-ray beam falls on a number of very
small crystalline areas, each separated from its neighbors by LEDS, a pattern such as that
in Fig. 8.9B can be expected. Evidently, when a bent crystal is annealed, the curved crys-
tal breaks up into a number of closely related small perfect crystal segments. This process
has been given the name polygonization .6
The polygonization phenomenon can also be explained with drawings such as those of
Fig. 8.10. The left-hand ﬁgure represents a portion of a plastically bent crystal. For simplic-
ity, the active slip plane has been assumed parallel to the top and the bottom surface of the
crystal. A plastically bent crystal must contain an excess of positive edge dislocations that lie
along active slip planes in the manner suggested by the ﬁgure. The dislocation conﬁguration
of Fig. 8.10A is one of high strain energy. A different arrangement of the same dislocations
that constitutes a simple form of LEDS is shown in Fig. 8.10B. Here the excess edge disloca-
tions are found in arrays that run in a direction normal to the slip planes. Conﬁgurations of
this nature constitute low-angle grain boundaries. (See Chapter 6.) When edge dislocations

of the same sign accumulate on the same slip plane, their strain ﬁelds are additive, as indi-
cated in Fig. 8.11A, where the local nature of the strain ﬁeld of each dislocation is suggested
by the appropriate letter: Cfor compression and Tfor tension. Obviously, the regions just
above and below the slip planes in Fig. 8.10A are areas of intense tensile and compressive
strain, respectively. However, if the same dislocations are arranged in a vertical sequence
(perpendicular to the slip plane), as shown in Fig. 8.10B, the strain ﬁelds of adjacent dislo-
cations partly cancel each other, for the tensile strain in the region below the extra plane of
one dislocation overlaps the compressive strain ﬁeld of the next lower dislocation. This
arrangement is shown schematically in Fig. 8.11B and was treated quantitatively in Sec. 6.4.
In addition to lowering the strain energy, the regrouping of edge dislocations into low-
angle boundaries has a second important effect. This is the removal of general lattice cur-
vature. As a result of polygonization, crystal segments lying between a pair of low-angle
boundaries approach the state of strain-free crystals with ﬂat uncurved planes. However,
each crystallite possesses an orientation slightly different from its neighbors because of the
low-angle boundaries that separate them from each other. When an X-ray beam strikes
the surface of a polygonized crystal it falls on a number of small, relatively perfect crystals
of slightly different orientation. The result is a Laue pattern of the type shown in 8.9B.
It is customary to call low-angle boundaries, such as develop in polygonization,
subboundaries , and the crystals that they separate, subgrains . The size, shape, and
arrangement of the subgrains constitute the substructure of a metal. The difference(A) (B)

between the concepts of grains and subgrains is an important one: subgrains lie inside
grains. Originally a subgrain structure was called a mosaic structure .
8.7 DISLOCATION MOVEMENTS IN POLYGONIZATION
An edge dislocation is capable of moving either by slip on its slip plane or by climb in a
direction perpendicular to its slip plane. Both are required in polygonization, as shown
schematically in Fig. 8.12, where the indicated vertical movement of each dislocation
represents climb, and the horizontal movement slip. The driving force for these move-
ments comes from the strain energy of the dislocations, which decreases as a result of
polygonization. From an equivalent viewpoint, we may say that the strain ﬁeld of dis-
locations grouped on slip planes produces an effective force that makes them move into
subboundaries or LEDS. This force exists at all temperatures, but at low temperatures
edge dislocations cannot climb. However, since dislocation climb depends on the move-
ment of vacancies (an activated process), the rate of polygonization increases rapidly
with temperature. Increasing temperature also aids the polygonization process in
another manner, for the movement of dislocations by slip also becomes easier at high
temperatures. This fact is observable in the fall of the critical resolved shear stress for slip
with rising temperature.
The photographs of Fig. 8.14 are of special interest because they show the polygon-
ization process in an actual metal (a silicon-iron alloy with 3.25 percent Si). The four
photographs show the surface of crystals plastically bent to a ﬁxed radius of curvature,
and then annealed. Each specimen was given a 1-hr anneal at a different temperature
in order to bring out the various stages of polygonization. The higher the temperature
the more complete is the polygonization process. The plane of the photograph is perpen-
dicular to the axis of bending and corresponds to the front face of the crystal, shown dia-
grammatically in Fig. 8.13. The surface in question is perpendicular to the slip plane

(01 ) of this body-centered cubic metal, and also to the plane along which the
subboundaries form (111). The orientations of both planes are shown in the ﬁgure and
it is clear that they make 45° angles with the horizontal: the slip plane having a positive
slope and the subboundary a negative slope. Figure 8.14A shows the effect of a 1-hr
anneal at 973 K. Each black dot of the illustration is a pit developed by etching the spec-
imen in a suitable etching reagent, and shows the intersection of a dislocation with the
specimen surface. Notice that the dislocations are, for the most part, associated with 
the slip planes, although several well-deﬁned subboundaries can be seen near the top of
the photograph. Many small groups containing three or four dislocations aligned per-
pendicular to the slip planes can also be seen in all areas of the picture. Figure 8.14B
shows a more advanced stage in the polygonization process corresponding to an anneal
at a higher temperature (1048 K). In this photograph, all the dislocations lie in the sub-
boundaries, or polygon walls.
When all of the dislocations have dissociated themselves from the slip planes and have
aligned themselves in low-angle boundaries, the polygonization process is not complete.
The next stage is a coalescence of the low-angle boundaries where two or more subbound-
aries combine to form a single boundary. The angle of rotation of the subgrains across the
boundary or LEDS must, of course, grow in this process. Well-deﬁned subboundaries
formed by coalescence can be seen in Fig. 8.14C, where the surface corresponds to a crys-
tal annealed for an hour at 1198 K. Notice that, although this photograph and that of 
Fig. 8.14B were taken at the same magniﬁcation, the number of subboundaries is now108Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 227

so that it is not generally possible to see individual dislocation etch pits.
The coalescence of subboundaries results from the fact that the strain energy associated
with a combined boundary is less than that associated with two separated boundaries. Themovement of subboundaries that occurs in coalescence is not difﬁcult to understand, for theboundaries are arrays of edge dislocations which, in turn, are fully capable of movement byeither climb or glide at high-annealing temperatures. In Fig. 8.14C, several junctions of sub-boundary pairs can be seen in the upper central portion of the photograph. Coalescence isbelieved to occur by the movement of these y-junctions. In the present example, movement
of the junctions toward the bottom of the photograph will combine the pairs of branchesinto single polygon walls.
As the polygon walls become more widely separated, the rate of coalescence becomes a
decreasing function of time and temperature so that the polygonization process approachesa more or less stable state with widely spaced, approximately parallel (in a single crystaldeformed by simple bending) subboundaries. This state is shown in Fig. 8.14D and corre-sponds to a 1-hr anneal of a bent silicon-iron crystal at 1333 K.
The photographs in Fig. 8.14 have shown the polygonization process in a single
crystal deformed by simple bending. In polycrystalline metals deformed by complexmethods, polygonization may still occur. The process is complicated by the fact that slipoccurs on a number of intersecting slip planes, and lattice curvatures are complexand vary with position in the crystal. The effect of such complex deformation on thepolygonization process is shown in Fig. 8.15, which reveals a substructure resultingfrom deforming a single crystal in a small rolling mill after being annealed at a very08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 228

high temperature (1373 K). The boundaries in this photograph are subboundaries
and are not grain boundaries. No recrystallization is involved in this highly polygonized
single crystal. Substructures such as this can be expected in cold-worked polycrystalline
metals that have been annealed at temperatures high enough to cause polygonization,
but not high enough, or long enough, to cause recrystallization.
A typical substructure, as revealed by the transmission electron microscope, is
shown in Fig. 8.16. This iron plus 3 percent silicon single crystal was originally cold
rolled 60 percent in the (001) [110] orientation and then annealed at elevated tem-
peratures. Rolling tends to form high-density dislocations with no well defined cell
boundaries, as shown in Fig. 8.16A. When the sample is annealed at 400°C for 1280
minutes, the dislocation density is reduced and random arrays of dislocations are vis-
ible, as seen in Fig. 8.16B. Subgrains and well defined polygonization become evident,
Fig. 8.16C, when the sample is annealed at a higher temperature of 600°C for 1280
minutes. Annealing at 800°C for 5 minutes, on the other hand, causes growth of the
subgrains with concomitant increase of the average subgrain diameter, as shown in
Fig. 8.16D. An important feature of this photograph is that the dislocations resulting
from this large strain (60 percent) have almost completely entered the cell walls. As a
result, most subgrains have interiors that are basically free of dislocations. Where
groups of dislocations are visible, it is probable that one is looking through a part of a
cell wall.
8.8 RECOVERY PROCESSES AT HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURES
Polygonization is too complicated a process to be expressed in terms of a simple rate
equation, such as that used to describe the recovery process after easy glide. Because
polygonization involves dislocation climb, relatively high temperatures are required
for rapid polygonization. In deformed polycrystalline metals, high-temperature
recovery is considered to be essentially a matter of polygonization and annihilation
of dislocations.
At lower temperatures other processes such as occur in dynamic recovery (see Sec. 6.7)
are of greater importance. At these temperatures, current theories picture the recoveryFIG. 8.16 Effect of annealing time and temperature on the microstructure of iron–3% Si single crystal cold rolled

value. The most important point defect is a vacancy which may have a ﬁnite mobility even
at relatively low temperatures.
8.9 RECRYSTALLIZATION
Recovery and recrystallization are two basically different phenomena. In an isothermal
anneal, the rate at which a recovery process occurs always decreases with time; that is, it
starts rapidly and proceeds at a slower and slower rate as the driving force for the reaction is
expended. On the other hand, the kinetics of recrystallization are quite different, for it occurs
much like a nucleation and growth process. In agreement with other processes of this type,
recrystallization during an isothermal anneal begins very slowly, and builds up to a maxi-
mum reaction rate, after which it ﬁnishes slowly. This difference between the isothermal
behavior of recovery and recrystallization is clearly evident in Fig. 8.4, where recovery
processes start at the beginning of the annealing cycle and account for the initial energy
release, while recrystallization starts later and accounts for the second (larger) energy release.
8.10 THE EFFECT OF TIME AND TEMPERATURE 
ON RECRYSTALLIZATION
One way to study the recrystallization process is to plot isothermal recrystallization
curves of the type shown in Fig. 8.17. Each curve represents the data for given temper-
ature and shows the amount of recrystallization as a function of time. Data for each
curve of this type are obtained by holding a number of identical cold-worked specimens
at a constant temperature for different lengths of time. After removal from the furnace
and cooling to room temperature, each specimen is examined metallographically to
determine the extent of recrystallization. This quantity (in percent) is then plotted
against the logarithm of the time. The effect of increasing the annealing temperature is
shown clearly in Fig. 8.17. The higher the temperature, the shorter the time needed
to ﬁnish the recrystallization. The S-shaped curves of Fig. 8.17 are similar to those of
nucleation and growth processes. A similar curve will be shown for the nucleation and08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 230

growth reaction involved in the precipitation of a second phase from a supersaturated
solid solution. (See Figure 16.4 in Chapter 16.)
A horizontal line drawn through the curves of Fig. 8.17 corresponds to a constant
fraction of recrystallization. Let us arbitrarily draw such a line corresponding to 
50 percent recrystallization. The intersection of this line with each of the isothermal
recrystallization curves gives the time at a given temperature required to recrystallize
half of the structure. Let us designate this time interval by the symbol τ. Figure 8.18
shows τplotted as a function of the reciprocal of the absolute temperature. The curve
of Fig. 8.18 is a straight line, which shows that the recrystallization data for this metal
(pure copper) can be expressed as an empirical equation of the form
8.4
where K(the slope of the curve) and C(the intercept of the curve with the ordinate axis)
are both constants. Equation 8.4 can also be expressed in the form
8.5
where 1/ τis the rate at which 50 percent of the structure is recrystallized, Ris the gas
constant (8.37 J/mol-K), and Qris called the activation energy for recrystallization.
The quantity τin Eq. 8.5 is not restricted to representing the time to recrystallize half
of the matrix. It may represent the time to complete any fraction of the recrystallization
process, such as the time to start the formation of new grains (several percent), or the time
to complete the process (100 percent).
It is necessary to point out the difference between the activation energy Qrfor
recrystallization and the previously discussed activation enthalpy for the motion of1

vacancies. The latter quantity can be directly related to a simple physical property:
the height of the energy barrier that an atom must cross to jump into a vacancy. Inthe present case, the physical significance of Q
ris not completely understood. There
is good reason to believe that more than one process is involved in recrystallization,so that Q
rcannot be related to a single simple process. It is best, therefore, to con-
sider the recrystallization activation energy as an empirical constant. Furthermore,modern recrystallization theory indicates that the activation energy generally doesnot remain a constant throughout the recrystallization process. In most cases, theactivation energy changes continuously during recrystallization as the driving forcefor recrystallization, the stored energy of cold work, is depleted. In addition,although recrystallization tends to follow a pattern like a nucleation and growthphenomenon, the formation of a nucleus—in the classical sense of an atom by atomaddition to an embryo until a stable nucleus is formed that then grows into a newlyformed recrystallized grain—does not occur. The origin of a recrystallized grain isalways a prexisting region that is highly misoriented in relation to the material sur-rounding it. This high degree of misorientation gives the region from which the newgrain originates the needed growth mobility.
Equation 8.5 is exactly equivalent to the empirical equation that holds for the
recovery of zinc single crystals after easy glide. Similar empirical rate equations havebeen found to describe the recrystallization process of a number of metals besidespure copper. Although it is not possible to generalize this equation and state that itaccurately applies to recrystallization phenomena in all metals, we can consider thatit is roughly descriptive of the relationship between time and temperature inrecrystallization.
8.11 RECRYSTALLIZATION TEMPERATURE
A frequently used metallurgical term is recrystallization temperature . This is the temper-
ature at which a particular metal with a particular amount of cold deformation willcompletely recrystallize in a finite period of time, usually 1 hr. Of course, in light ofEq. 8.5, the recrystallization temperature has no meaning unless the time allowed forrecrystallization is also specified. However, because of the large activation energiesencountered, recrystallization actually appears to occur at some definite minimumtemperature. Suppose for a given metal Q
r/H11005200,000 J per mole, and that recrystal-
lization is completed in 1 hr at 600 K. Then it may be shown, with the aid of Eq. 8.5,that if the annealing is carried out at a 10 K lower temperature (590 K), completerecrystallization will require slightly over 2 hr. A specimen of this particular metal willonly be partly recrystallized at the end of an anneal of 1 hr at 10 K below its recrys-tallization temperature (600 K). On the other hand, an hour’s anneal is more thanenough to recrystallize the metal at any temperature above 600 K. In fact, a 10 K risein temperature to 610 K shortens the recrystallization time to half an hour, and a 20 K rise to approximately 15 min. To the practical engineer, this sensitivity of therecrystallization process to small changes in temperature makes it appear as thoughthe metal has a fixed temperature, below which it will not recrystallize, and for thisreason, there is a tendency to regard the recrystallization temperature as a property ofthe metal and to neglect the time factor in recrystallization.08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 232
233 8.12 The Effect of Strain on Recrystallization
8.12 THE EFFECT OF STRAIN ON RECRYSTALLIZATION
Two rate-of-crystallization curves similar to that of Fig. 8.18 are plotted in Fig. 8.19.
These differ only in that they represent the recrystallization of zirconium instead of
copper, and the rate at which complete recrystallization is observed instead of half-
recrystallization. The data are plotted in the usual sense (log 1/ τvs /H110801/T), but for con-
venient reading, the abscissae and ordinates are expressed in degrees Kelvin and hours,
respectively. The two curves represent data from specimens cold worked by different
amounts. In both cases, the zirconium metal was cold worked by swaging. Swaging is a
means of mechanical deformation used on cylindrical rods in which the diameter of the
rod is reduced uniformly by a mechanical hammer equipped with rotating dies. The
amount of this cold work is measured in terms of the percentage reduction in area of
the cylindrical cross-section. The left-hand curve of Fig. 8.19 corresponds to specimens
with a cross-section area reduced 13 percent, while the right-hand curve represents
specimens that suffered a larger reduction in area (51 percent). The two curves show
clearly that recrystallization is promoted by increasing amounts of cold work. When
annealed at the same temperature, the metal with the larger amount of cold work
recrystallizes much faster than that with the lesser reduction. As an example, at 826 K
the times for completion of recrystallization are 1.6 and 40 hr for the larger and the
smaller reductions in area, respectively. Similarly, the temperature at which the metal
recrystallizes completely within an hour is lower for a greater amount of cold work;
840 K as compared to 900 K.
A close examination of the two curves of Fig. 8.19 shows that these straight
lines do not have the same slope. This means that the temperature dependence of
recrystallization varies with the amount of cold work, or that the activation energy
for recrystallization is a function of the amount of deformation. This fact is further
emphasized by the data of Fig. 8.20, which show the variation of the activation
energy for this same metal (zirconium) as a function of the percent reduction
in area over the range of deformation from less than 10 percent to greater than 
90 percent. The fact that the activation energy Qrvaries with the amount of cold
work lends additional confirmation to the previous statement about the complex
nature of Qr.

8.13 THE RATE OF NUCLEATION AND THE RATE 
OF NUCLEUS GROWTH
The preceding sections have shown that the recrystallization reaction in many metals can
be described by a simple activation equation having the form
rate/H11005Ae/H11002Qr/H20862RT8.6
Unfortunately, this empirical equation reveals very little about the atomic mechanisms that
occur during recrystallization. This is because of the dual character of a nucleation and
growth reaction. The rate at which a metal recrystallizes depends on the rate at which
nuclei form, and also on the rate at which they grow. These two rates also determine the
ﬁnal grain size of a recrystallized metal. If nuclei form rapidly and grow slowly, many crys-
tals will form before their mutual impingement completes the recrystallization process. In
this case, the ﬁnal grain size is small. On the other hand, it will be large if the rate of nucle-
ation is small compared to the rate of growth. Since the kinetics of recrystallization can
often be described in terms of these two rates, a number of investigators have measured
these quantities under isothermal conditions in the hope of learning more about the mech-
anism of recrystallization. This requires the introduction of two parameters: N, the rate of
nucleation and G, the rate of growth.
It is customary to deﬁne the nucleation frequency, N, as the number of nuclei that
form per second in a cubic centimeter of unrecrystallized matrix. This parameter is
referred to the unrecrystallized matrix because the recrystallized portion is inactive with
regard to further nucleation. The linear rate of growth, G, is deﬁned as the time rate of
change of the diameter of a recrystallized grain. In practice, Gis measured by annealing
for different lengths of time a number of identical specimens at a chosen isothermal tem-
perature. The diameter of the largest grain in each specimen is measured after the spec-
imens are cooled to room temperature and prepared metallographically. The variation
of this diameter with isothermal annealing time gives the rate of growth, G. The rate of
nucleation can be determined from the same metallographic specimens by counting
the number of grains per unit area on the surface of each. These surface-density meas-
urements can then be used to give the number of recrystallized grains per unit volume.0 20 30 40 50 60 70

235 8.14 Formation of Nuclei
Of course, each determination must be corrected for the volume of the matrix that has
recrystallized.
Several equations7have been derived starting with the parameters Nand G, which
express the amount of recrystallization as a function of time. (See Fig. 8.17.) Because thetheories on which these equations are based diverge to some extent, and because space islimited, they will not be discussed further. The concepts of nucleation rate and growth rateare useful, however, in explaining the effects of several other variables on the recrystal-lization process.
8.14 FORMATION OF NUCLEI
In recrystallization, an entirely new set of grains is formed. New crystals appear at pointsof high-lattice-strain energy, such as slip-line intersections, deformation twin intersections,and in areas close to grain boundaries. In each case, it appears that nucleation occurs atpoints of strong lattice curvature. In this regard it is interesting to note that bent, or twistedsingle crystals recrystallize more readily than do similar crystals that have been bent, ortwisted, and then unbent, or untwisted.
Because the new grains form in regions of severe localized deformation, the sites where
they appear are apparently predetermined. Nuclei of this type are called preformed nuclei .
8
A number of models have been proposed to show how it is possible to form a small, strain-free volume that can grow out and consume the deformed matrix around it. These modelsare in general agreement on two points. First, a region of a crystal can become a nucleusand grow only if its size exceeds some minimum value. For example, Detert and Zieb
9have
computed that in a deformed metal with a dislocation density of 1012cm/H110022, a preformed
nucleus has to have a diameter greater than about 15 nm for it to be able to expand. (Thisgeneral concept of the critical size of a nucleus will be considered in Chapters 15 and 16.)
The other condition for the formation of a nucleus is that it become surrounded, at
least in part, by the equivalent of a high-angle grain boundary. This condition is requiredbecause the mobility of an arbitrary low-angle grain boundary is normally very low.Beyond these two points, the various models of the nucleation process vary to a consid-erable degree. It is possible that most of these mechanisms may operate and that the pre-ferred one in a given situation will depend largely on the nature of the deformedspecimen being recrystallized. In this regard, a single crystal lacks the sites along grainboundaries and along lines where three grains meet that are available for nucleation in apolycrystalline metal. Both grain boundaries and these triple lines are regions wherehigh-angle boundaries already exist, so that one of the criteria for the formations of anucleus is effectively satisﬁed. A typical mechanism applicable to polycrystals is that ofBailey and Hirsch,
10who propose that if a difference in dislocation density exists across
a grain boundary in a cold-worked metal, then during annealing a portion of the moreperfect grain might migrate into the less perfect grain under the driving force associatedwith the strain energy difference across the boundary. This would be accomplished by theforward movement of the grain boundary so as to form a bulge, as indicated in Fig. 8.21.This boundary movement should effectively sweep up the dislocations in its path, therebycreating a small, relatively strain-free volume of crystal. If this bulge exceeds the criticalnucleus size, both primary conditions for the formation of a nucleus would be satisﬁed.
It is not possible to consider in detail all of the proposed nucleation models. We will
discuss brieﬂy two mechanisms that are probably more applicable to single crystals thanto polycrystals. The ﬁrst is due to Cahn
11and to Beck.12This mechanism, which predates08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 235

a result of polygonization, it might be possible to produce a subgrain capable of growing
out into the surrounding polygonized matrix. The other mechanism that should be appli-
cable to single crystals involves the concept of subgrain coalescence, or the combination
of subgrains to form a strainfree region large enough in size to grow. As postulated in this
theory,13the elimination of a subgrain boundary must result in a relative rotation of the
two subgrains that are combined.
For polycrystalline materials, nucleation will again take place preferentially at highly
energetic sites, such as grain-boundary triple points, original grain boundaries, and bound-
aries between deformation bands. The nuclei may form by subgrain growth and/or grain
boundary migration, as schematically shown in Fig. 8.22. The nucleus shown in Fig. 8.22A
has formed by growth of the subgrains to the right of the original grain boundary, whereas
the nucleus in Fig. 8.22B has formed by grain boundary migration to the right and subgrain
growth to the left. For both cases, the nucleus is surrounded by high-angle boundaries. For
the nucleus shown in Fig. 8.22C, on the other hand, the subgrain growth to the left has
taken place without forming a new high-angle boundary.08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 236
237 8.16 The Recrystallized Grain Size
8.15 DRIVING FORCE FOR RECRYSTALLIZATION
The driving force for recrystallization comes from the stored energy of cold work. In those
cases where polygonization is essentially completed before the start of recrystallization, the
stored energy can be assumed to be conﬁned to the dislocations in polygon walls. The
elimination of the subboundaries is a basic part of the recrystallization process.
8.16 THE RECRYSTALLIZED GRAIN SIZE
Another important factor in recrystallization studies is the recrystallized grain size. This is
the crystal size immediately at the end of recrystallization, that is, before grain growth
proper has had a chance to occur. Figure 8.23 shows that the recrystallized grain size
depends upon the amount of deformation given to the specimens before annealing. The
signiﬁcant part of this curve is that the grain size grows rapidly with decreasing deforma-
tion. Too little deformation, however, will make recrystallization impossible in any reason-
able length of time. This leads to the concept of the critical amount of cold work, which
may be deﬁned as the minimum amount of cold deformation that allows the specimen to
recrystallize (within a reasonable time period). In Fig. 8.23 it corresponds to about 3 per-
cent elongation of the polycrystalline brass in a tensile test. The critical deformation, like
the recrystallization temperature, is not a property of a metal, since its value varies with
the type of deformation (tension, torsion, compression, rolling, etc.). In single crystals of
hexagonal metals, when deformation occurs by easy glide, the critical deformation may
exceed several hundred percent. Twisting the same crystal to a few percent strain, how-
ever, may make it possible to recrystallize the specimen.
The concept of a critical deformation is important because the very large grain size
associated with it is usually undesirable in metals that are to be further deformed. This is
particularly true for sheet metal that is to be cold-formed into complicated shapes. If the
grain size of a metal is very small (less than about 0.05 mm in diameter), plastic deforma-
tion occurs without appreciable roughing of the surface (assuming that deformation does
not occur by movement of Lüders bands). On the other hand, if the diameter of the aver-
age grain is large, cold working produces a roughened, objectionable surface. Such a phe-
nomenon is frequently identiﬁed by the term orange-peel effect because of the similarity of

plastic strain inside crystals is directly responsible for the orange-peel effect, and the larger
the crystals the more evident will be the nonhomogeneous nature of the deformation.
In metal that is cold-rolled (sheets) or drawn cold through dies (wires, rods, and pipe),
it is relatively easy to avoid a critical amount of cold work because the metal is more or
less uniformly deformed. On the other hand, if only a portion of a metallic object is
deformed cold, a region containing a critical amount of cold work must exist between the
worked and unworked areas. Annealing in this case can easily lead to a localized, very
coarse-grain growth.
On the other hand, it should be noted that the concept of a critical strain can some-
times be most useful, as in the production of single crystals for use in experimental stud-
ies of basic crystal properties. This is also true for the production of bi-crystals and other
large-grained specimens to be used in experimental investigations of grain boundaries.
The ratio of the rate of nucleation to the rate of growth, Nto G, is frequently used in
the interpretation of recrystallization data. If it is assumed that both Nand Gare constant
or are average values for an isothermal recrystallization process, then the recrystallized
grain size can be deduced from this ratio. If the ratio is high, many nuclei will form before
the recrystallization process is completed, and a ﬁne-grain size will result. On the other
hand, a low ratio corresponds to a slow rate of nucleation relative to the rate of growth, and
to a coarse crystal size in a recrystallized specimen. In Fig. 8.24, the rate of nucleation, N,
the rate of growth, G, and the ratio of Nto Gare all plotted as a function of strain for a spe-
ciﬁc metal (aluminum). These curves show that, as the deformation before annealing is
reduced to smaller and smaller values, the rate of nucleation falls much faster than the rate
of growth. As a consequence, the ratio Nto Gdecreases in magnitude with decreasing strain
and, for the data of Fig. 8.24, is effectively zero at several percent elongation.
Thus it can be concluded that a critical amount of cold work corresponds to an amount
just capable of forming the nuclei needed for recrystallization. This agrees well with the
fact that nuclei form at points of high-strain energy in the lattice. The number of these
points certainly should increase with the severity of the deformation and at low strains the
number should almost vanish.
Another very important factor concerning the recrystallized grain size (at the end of
recrystallization and before the beginning of grain growth) is apparent in Fig. 8.23: the
recrystallized grain size in the case of the brass specimens used for the data of Fig. 8.23 is
independent of the temperature of recrystallization. Notice that these data correspond to
ﬁve different annealing temperatures and that all temperatures give values that fall on a
single curve. This relationship also holds, within limits, for many other metals and to a ﬁrst08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 238

is independent of the recrystallization temperature.
8.17 OTHER VARIABLES IN RECRYSTALLIZATION
It has been shown that the rate of recrystallization is dependent upon two variables: 
(1) temperature of annealing and (2) amount of deformation.
Similarly, it has been shown that, for many metals, the recrystallized grain size is inde-
pendent of the annealing temperature, but sensitive to the amount of strain. The recrystal-
lization process is also dependent upon several other variables. Two of the more important
of these are (1) purity, or composition of the metal; and (2) the initial grain size (before
deformation). These factors will be considered brieﬂy.
8.18 PURITY OF THE METAL
It is a well known fact that extremely pure metals have very rapid rates of recrystalliza-
tion. This is apparent in the sharp dependence of the recrystallization temperature on the
presence of solute. As little as 0.01 percent of a foreign atom in solid solution can raise the
recrystallization temperature by several hundred degrees. Conversely, a spectroscopically
pure metal recrystallizes in a ﬁxed interval at much lower temperatures than a metal of
commercial purity.
The effect of solute atoms on the rate of recrystallization is most apparent at very small
concentrations. This is shown clearly in Fig. 8.25 for aluminum of various degrees of
purity. It has also been observed that the increase in the recrystallization temperature
caused by the presence of foreign atoms depends markedly upon the nature of the solute
atoms. Table 8.1 shows the increase in the recrystallization temperature corresponding to
the addition of the same amount (0.01 atomic percent) of several different elements in
pure copper.
The fact that very small numbers of solute atoms have such a pronounced effect on
recrystallization rates is believed to indicate that the solute atoms interact with grain
boundaries. The proposed interaction is similar to that between dislocations and solute
atoms. When a foreign atom migrates to a grain boundary, both its elastic ﬁeld, as well
as that of the boundary, are lowered. In recrystallization, grain-boundary motion08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 239

occurs as the nuclei form and grow. The presence of foreign atoms in atmospheres asso-
ciated with these boundaries strongly retards their motion, and therefore lowers therecrystallization rates.
8.19 INITIAL GRAIN SIZE
When a polycrystalline metal is cold worked, the grain boundaries act to interruptthe slip processes that occur in the crystals. As a consequence, the lattice adjacentto the grain boundaries is, on the average, much more distorted than in the center ofthe grains. Decreasing the grain size increases the grain-boundary area and, as aconsequence, the volume and uniformity of distorted metal (that adjacent to theboundaries). This effect increases the number of possible sites of nucleation and,therefore, the smaller the grains of the metal before cold work, the greater will be therate of nucleation and the smaller the recrystallized grain size for a given degree ofdeformation.
8.20 GRAIN GROWTH
It is now generally recognized that in a completely recrystallized metal, the driving forcefor grain growth lies in the surface energy of the grain boundaries. As the grains growin size and their numbers decrease, the grain boundary area diminishes and the totalsurface energy is lowered accordingly. The growth of cells in a foam of soap also occursas a result of a decrease in surface energy: the surface energy of the soap ﬁlm. Becausea number of complicating factors that inﬂuence the growth of metal crystals do notapply in the case of soap ﬁlms, the growth of soap bubbles may be taken as a rather idealcase of cellular growth. For this reason, the growth of soap cells will be consideredbefore the more complicated case of metallic grain growth.
First, consider a single spherical soap bubble. The gas enclosed by the soap ﬁlm is
always at a greater pressure than that on the outside of the bubble because of the surface08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 240
241 8.20 Grain Growth
tensions in the soap ﬁlm. In an elementary physics course it is shown that this pressure dif-
ference between the inside and outside of the soap bubble can be expressed by the simpleequation
8.7
where gis the surface tension of one surface of the ﬁlm (soap ﬁlms have two surfaces), 
Ris the radius of the soap bubble, and Dis its diameter. This equation shows clearly that
the smaller the bubble, the greater the excess pressure inside the bubble.
Because of the pressure difference that exists across a curved soap ﬁlm, gaseous diffu-
sion occurs; the net ﬂow occurring through the ﬁlm from the high- to the low-pressureside. In other words, the atoms diffuse from the inside to the outside of the bubble, result-ing in a decrease in size of the bubble and a movement of its walls inward toward theircenter of curvature.
The above discussion can now be carried over to the more general example, a soap
froth. In the froth, the cells contain curved walls, and the curvature varies from cell tocell and within the ﬁlm surrounding any one cell, depending on the relative size andshape of the neighboring cells. (These factors will be discussed in more detail presently.)In all cases, however, a pressure difference exists across each curved wall, with thegreater pressure on the concave side. Gas diffusion resulting from this pressure differ-ence, in turn, causes the walls to move but always in a direction toward their center ofcurvature.
Let us ﬁnd out how the movement of cell walls causes the cells in the soap froth to
grow in size. For the sake of simplicity, consider a network of two-dimensional cells, thosewith walls perpendicular to the plane of view. A froth of this type can be formed betweentwo closely spaced parallel plates of glass. This simpliﬁcation greatly reduces geometricalcomplexity, and still permits the more important principles of cellular growth to beobserved.
Figure 8.26 presents a sequence of pictures from the work of C. S. Smith, showing
the growth of the cells in a two-dimensional soap froth formed in a small ﬂat glass cell.The ﬁgure at the lower right-hand corner of each photograph represents the number ofminutes from the time that agitation of the cell to form the froth was ended. It also rep-resents the time during which cell growth has taken place. In several of the photographs,small, three-sided cells can be observed. In the third photograph from the left in theupper row one appears at approximately 9 o’clock, and another at about 10 o’clock in theﬁrst photograph from the left in the lower row. An enlarged sketch of one of these cellsis shown in Fig. 8.27. Notice that in order to maintain the equilibrium angle of 120°required when three surfaces with equal surface tensions meet at a common junction,the cell walls of the three-sided cell have been forced to assume a rather pronounced cur-vature. Since this curvature is concave toward the center of the cell, the wall can beexpected to migrate, thus decreasing the volume of the cell and causing it to disappearcompletely. That this actually occurs can be seen by studying the photographs just to theright of the two photographs mentioned previously. In each case the triangular grains areno longer visible.
Further study of the photographs of Fig. 8.26 reveals that cells with less than six sides
have walls that are primarily concave toward their centers. Those cells with more thansix sides have walls convex toward their centers; this effect is more pronounced the larger/H9004p/H110054g

Notice the pronounced curvature of the bound-
aries, which is concave toward the center of

the number of sides above six. This conﬁrms the fact that the only two-dimensional geo-
metrical ﬁgure formed by straight lines that can have an average internal angle of 120°
is the hexagon. In a two-dimensional structure, such as that shown in the photographs
of Fig. 8.26, all cells with less than six sides are basically unstable and tend to shrink in
size, while those with more than six sides tend to grow in size. Another interesting fact
is that there is a deﬁnite correspondence between the size of the cells and the number of
sides that they contain. The smaller cells usually have the fewest number of sides. It is no
wonder that three-sided cells disappear so rapidly, for both their small size and minimum
number of sides require that their walls have very large curvatures, with accompanying
high-pressure differentials, diffusion rates, and rates of wall migration. The photographs
show that, in general, four- and ﬁve-sided cells do not disappear as a unit, but ﬁrst change
to three-sided cells which rapidly disappear.
Another important aspect of cellular growth can be seen in the photographs of
Fig. 8.26. Over a period of time the number of sides that any given grain possesses
continually changes. The number of sides may increase or decrease, as can be seen08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 242
243 8.21 Geometrical Coalescence
by considering the mechanism of Burke and Turnbull14illustrated in Fig. 8.28.
Because of the curvature of the boundaries that separate cells Band Dfrom Aand C,
respectively, the boundaries migrate, thus eliminating the boundary between cells B
and D, and then they create a new boundary between Aand C. These steps are indi-
cated in Figs. 8.28B and 8.28C, respectively. As a consequence of this process, cells B
and Deach lose a side, while cells Aand Ceach gain a side. Another method by which
the number of sides of a cell can be changed has already been described. Each time
a three-sided cell disappears, each of its neighboring cells loses one side.
8.21 GEOMETRICAL COALESCENCE
Nielsen15has proposed that the geometrical coalescence of grains is an important phenom-
enon in recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. Subgrain coalescence has already
been discussed in relation to the formation of nuclei during recrystallization. The mecha-
nism that Nielsen favors does not require that the subgrains or grains rotate through an
appreciable angle relative to each other, as in the Hu and Li mechanism. Geometrical coa-
lescence can be simply described as an encounter of two grains whose relative orientations
are such that the boundary formed between the two grains is one of much lower surface
energy, gG, than that of the average boundary. In a polycrystalline metal, such a boundary
would be equivalent to a subgrain boundary. The effect of producing this type of bound-
ary on the microstructure is indicated schematically in Fig. 8.29. First, let us imagine that
grains Aand Bencounter each other during a process of grain growth in a metal where it
is assumed that the boundaries have the two-dimensional character of the soap froth in a
ﬂat cell. Before the encounter, the two grains are separated, as shown in Fig. 8.29B. If the
boundary that is produced when they meet is a typical high-angle boundary, the grain
boundary surface energy gGwill be effectively the same as that of the other boundaries,
and a boundary conﬁguration such as that in Fig. 8.29C is expected. On the other hand,
if a very low-energy boundary is formed, then, because of the low value of gGin the
boundary ab, the effective surface tension forces along abwill be very small and the grain
boundary conﬁguration (shown in Fig. 8.29D) should result. From this illustration it can
be seen that a geometrical coalescence should result in the sudden development of a much
larger grain. Note that in this two-dimensional example, this large grain has nine sides.A

FIG. 8.29 Geometrical coalescence. Two grains, Aand B, encounter as a
result of the disappearance of grain C. If grains Aand Bhave nearly identical
orientation, then boundary abbecomes the equivalent of a subboundary 
and grains Aand Bmay be considered the equivalent of a single grain
Grains formed by geometrical coalescence should thus have the possibility of continued
rapid growth.
Geometrical coalescence, if it occurs to any extent, should have a strong effect on
grain-growth kinetics. In a metal containing a more or less random set of crystal ori-
entations, geometrical coalescence should probably occur infrequently. On the other
hand, geometrical coalescence may be an important phenomenon in a highly textured
metal: one that has a strong preferred orientation. In this case the chances of two
grains of nearly identical orientation encountering each other during grain growth is
certainly much greater. It is also much greater in the case of subgrain growth during
recrystallization.
8.22 THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHANGES IN GRAIN GEOMETRY
In a metal, the grains are not two-dimensional in character, but three-dimensional. The
ﬁve basic mechanisms by which the geometrical properties of the three-dimensional
grains can change have been outlined by Rhines.16A brief summary of these mecha-
nisms due to DeHoff is shown in Fig. 8.30. The analog of the three-sided two-dimen-
sional grain of Fig. 8.27 is shown in Fig. 8.30A. It is a four-sided or tetrahedral grain.
Its disappearance results in the loss of four grain boundaries. Figure 8.30B is the corre-
sponding three-dimensional analog of the mechanism illustrated in Fig. 8.28. Note that
the grain boundary BDin Fig. 8.28 becomes a three-grain juncture or triple line in the08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 244
245 8.23 The Grain Growth Law
three-dimensional example. If the upper and lower grains should come together,
this line is removed and replaced by a horizontal grain boundary lying between
the upper and lower grains. The result is a gain of one grain boundary. The third case,
in Fig. 8.30C, is simply the inverse of that which has just been discussed.
An interesting mechanism is shown in 8.30D. This is the three-dimensional example
of the geometrical coalescence of grains discussed in the preceding section. In this case,
the upper and lower grains are again assumed to be able to approach each other as in the
case of Fig. 8.30B, but in this case the boundary formed between the two grains is a low-
energy boundary. The result is an effective coalescence of the upper and lower grains.
Finally, Fig. 8.30E shows the inverse of geometrical coalescence. Here one grain necks
and separates into two grains.
8.23 THE GRAIN GROWTH LAW
Another interesting aspect of the grain growth pictures in Fig. 8.26 is that, while the num-
ber of cells keeps decreasing as time goes on, the cellular arrays are geometrically similar
at all times. This would be even more evident if a larger sample of soap froth were avail-
able for our study. At any rate, it is apparent that at any given instant the cells vary in size
about a mean and that this mean size grows with time. The mean cell diameter serves as
a convenient measure of the cell size of an aggregate. Therefore, when one refers to the(A) (C)

cell size of a froth, it is the diameter of the average cell that is meant. This statement also
holds true for metals where the commonly used term “grain size” refers, in general, to themean diameter of an aggregate of grains. It follows that grain growth, or cellular growth,refers to the growth of the average diameter of the aggregate. Attention is called, however,to the difﬁculties involved in accurately deﬁning this concept of an average grain size in ametal, as pointed out in Chapter 6.
Let us now derive an expression for a soap froth that relates the size of the average
cell to the time. In this derivation we shall not limit ourselves to the two-dimensional case,but shall consider that we are working in three dimensions. We shall ﬁrst assumethat the rate of growth of the cells is proportional to the curvature of the cell walls of theaverage cell at a given instant of time. This is in agreement with the fact that boundariesmove as a result of gaseous diffusion caused by a pressure difference from one side of asoap ﬁlm to the other, that is proportional to the curvature of the boundary. If the symbolDrepresents the mean diameter of the average-sized soap cell, and cthe curvature of the
cell walls, we have

where tis the time, and K/H11032a constant of proportionality. Let us also assume that the
curvature of the average-sized cell is inversely proportional to its diameter, and rewrite Eq. 8.8 in the following form:

following result:
D2/H11005Kt/H11001c

evaluation of the constant of integration gives
D2/H11002D2
0/H11001Kt 8.10
Although several broad assumptions have been made in deriving Eq. 8.10, exper-
imental measurements of the growth of cells in a soap froth have shown that thisexpression fits the observed data quite closely.
17It can therefore be concluded that
Eq. 8.10 is essentially correct for the growth of soap cells under the action of surface-tension forces.
It it is assumed that the grain size is very small at the beginning of cell growth, then it
is possible to neglect D

froth grows as the square root of the time. Figure 8.31 shows a sketch of this relationship—
clearly, as time progresses, the rate of cellular growth diminishes.
Let us consider the case of grain growth in metals. Here, as in soap froth, the driving
force for the reaction lies in the surface energy of the grain boundaries. Grain-boundary
movements in metals are, in many respects, perfectly analogous to those of the cell walls
of soap froth. In both cases, the boundaries move toward their centers of curvature, and
the rate of this movement varies with the amount of curvature. On the other hand, while
it is known that the growth of soap cells can be explained in terms of a simple diffusion of
gas molecules through the walls of the soap ﬁlm, less is known about the mechanism by
which atoms on one side of a grain boundary cross the boundary and join the crystal on
the other side.
It was originally proposed18and generally accepted that the boundary atoms in the
crystal on the concave side of the boundary are more tightly bound than the boundary
atoms in the crystal in the convex side, because they are more nearly surrounded by
neighboring atoms of the same crystal. This tighter binding of the atoms on the concave
side of the boundary should make the rate at which atoms jump across the boundary
from the convex to the concave crystal greater than that in the opposite direction. The
greater the curvature of the boundary, then the greater should be this effect, and the
faster the movement of the crystal boundary. However, because detailed knowledge of
the structure of metallic grain boundaries is lacking, the exact nature of the transfer
mechanism by which atoms cross a boundary is still not known, and it is not possible to
explain quantitatively the apparently irrational results obtained when studying the
growth of crystals in a metal.
While a quantitative theory capable of explaining grain growth in pure metals and
alloys is lacking, much is known about the causes for the apparent abnormal nature of
metallic crystal growth. A number of these will now be considered, but ﬁrst let us reconsider
some of the factors that have been brought out in the study of soap froths. If metallic grain
growth is assumed to occur as a result of surface-energy considerations and the diffusion of
atoms across a grain boundary, then it is to be expected that at any given temperature a
grain-growth law of the same form as that found in a soap froth might be observed, namely,

Also, if the diffusion of atoms across a grain boundary is considered to be an activated
process, then it can be shown that the constant Kin Eq. 8.12 can be replaced by the
expression
K/H11005K0e/H11002Q/H20862RT
where Qis an empirical heat of activation for the process, Tis the temperature in
degrees Kelvin, and Ris the international gas constant. The grain-growth law can
therefore be written as a function of both temperature and time in the following
manner:
D2/H11002D2
0/H11005K0te/H11002Q/H20862RT8.13
Most early experimental studies of metallic growth have failed to conﬁrm the above rela-
tionship. However, some work has given results that conform quite closely to Eq. 8.13.
Figure 8.32 shows part of these results for brass (10 percent zinc and 90 percent copper).
Note that in each case, straight lines are obtained when D2is plotted against the time. Let
us now rearrange Eq. 8.13 as follows:
Taking logarithms of both sides of this equation gives
8.14
This relationship tells us that the quantity log( D2/H11002D2
0)/H20862tshould vary directly as the
reciprocal of the absolute temperature (1 /H20862T) and that the slope of this linear relationship
is Q/H208622.3R. Now, the quantity ( D2/H11002D2
0)/H20862tequals the slope of a grain-growth isotherm,
such as those shown in Fig. 8.32. Figure 8.33 shows the logarithm of the slopes of the
four lines in Fig. 8.32 (log[ D2/H11002D2
0]/H20862t) plotted as functions of the reciprocal of the
absolute temperature (1 /H20862T). The data in question give an excellent straight line from
which it can be deduced that the activation energy Qfor grain growth in alpha-brass
containing 10 percent Zn is 73.6 KJ per gm atom.logD2/H11002D2

Many of the experimental isothermal grain-growth data correspond to empirical
equations of the form
D/H11002D0/H11005ktn8.15
where the exponent nis, in most cases, smaller than the value predicted by the grain-
growth equation. Frequently a value near 0.3 is found. As discussed below, the rate equa-
tion can also be affected by the presence of impurities and foreign particles. Furthermore,
the exponent nis not usually constant for a given metal or alloy if the isothermal reaction
temperature is changed. As a general rule, the exponent increases with increasing temper-
ature and approaches the value .
Finally, it should be emphasized that while Eq. 8.15 applies to the average grain size,
it provides no information on the growth of individual grains when the metal contain dif-
ferent size grains. In fact, almost all deformed and recrystallized metals have a grain-size
distribution whose spread depends on the amount of deformation prior to annealing. This
is nicely documented by the work of Rhines and Patterson19on the grain-size distribution
of recrystallized aluminum. They show that the grain volume or weight of recrystallized
aluminum has a distribution that is log-normal and that the spread of the distribution is
determined by the amount of prior deformation. The grain-size distribution is broadest
after small deformation. Moreover, Rhines and Patterson show that the grain distribution
retains its form with increased time after recrystallization, implying that grain growth is
more rapid and remains so after small deformation. The authors assert that the metal
retains memory of the degree of the prior cold work.
8.24 IMPURITY ATOMS IN SOLID SOLUTION
Of considerable importance in grain growth is that foreign atoms in a lattice can
interact with grain boundaries. This interaction is analogous to the interaction
between impurity atoms and dislocations, previously mentioned as a factor in recrys-
tallization (that is, nucleus growth). If the size of a foreign atom and that of the par-
ent crystal are different, then there will be an elastic stress field introduced into the
lattice by each foreign atom. However, since grain boundaries are regions of lattice
misfit, the strain energy of the boundary, as well as that of the lattice surrounding a
foreign atom, can be reduced by the migration of the foreign atom to the neighbor-
hood of the grain boundary. In this manner, we can conceive of grain-boundary1

atmospheres just as we can dislocation atmospheres. That these atmospheres can
effectively hinder the motion of grain boundaries has been verified experimentally.
Figure 8.34 shows the grain-growth exponent as a function of impurity content for
copper containing small percentages of aluminum in solid solution. Notice that as the
metal approaches 100-percent purity, the grain-growth exponent increases toward
the theoretical value . Also, note that at the higher temperature (900 K) the rate of
approach is faster. This temperature dependence of the grain-growth exponent can
be explained by assuming that the grain-boundary solute atmospheres are broken up
by thermal vibrations at high temperatures.
The effect of solutes in retarding grain growth varies with the element concerned.
While solid solutions of zinc in copper may behave normally (provided other impurities
are eliminated) with respect to the grain-growth law , even as small a quantity as
0.01 percent of oxygen will effectively retard grain growth in copper. This difference is
probably due to the different magnitudes of strain that various elements produce in the
lattice: those elements that distort the lattice structure the most have the largest effect on
the rate of grain growth.
8.25 IMPURITIES IN THE FORM OF INCLUSIONS
Solute atoms not in solid solution are also capable of interacting with grain boundaries. It
has been known for more than sixty years that impurity atoms in the form of second-
phase inclusions or particles can inhibit grain growth in metals. The inclusions referred to
are frequently found in commercial alloys and so-called commercially pure metals. For the
most part, they may consist of very small oxide, sulﬁde, or silicate particles that were
incorporated in the metal during its manufacture. In the present discussion, however, they
may be considered to be any second-phase particle that is ﬁnely divided and distributed
throughout the metal.
Let us consider a simpliﬁed theory of the interaction between inclusions and grain
boundaries, due to Zener. Figure 8.35A is a schematic sketch of an inclusion located in a
grain boundary represented as a vertical straight line. For convenience, the particle has
been made spherical. As shown in the left-hand sketch, the inclusion and boundary are in
a position of mechanical equilibrium. If the boundary is moved to the right, as indicated
in Fig. 8.35B, the grain boundary assumes a curved shape in which the boundary (because
of its surface tension) strives to maintain itself normal to the surface of the particle. The
vectors marked sin the ﬁgure indicate the direction and magnitude of the surface-tension(n/H112291

stress at the circular line of contact (in three dimensions) between the grain boundary and
the surface of the inclusion. The total length of the line of contact is 2 prcos u, where r
is the radius of the spherical particle, and uis the angle between the equilibrium position
of the boundary and the vector s. The product of the horizontal component of this vector
ssin uand the length of the line of contact (between particle and boundary) gives the pull
of the boundary on the particle:

This force, by Newton’s Second Law, is also the drag of the particle on the grain bound-
ary; it is a maximum when uis 45°. Substituting this value gives for the maximum force
f/H11005prs 8.17
Notice that the drag of a single particle varies directly as the radius of the particle. Since
the volume of each particle varies as the cube of its radius, the effect of second-phase inclu-
sions in hindering grain boundary motion will be greater the smaller and more abundant
are the particles (assuming particles of the same shape).
In many cases, second-phase particles tend to dissolve at high temperatures. It is also
generally true that second-phase particles tend to coalesce at high temperatures and form
fewer large particles. Both of these effects—the decrease in amount of the second phase
and the tendency to form larger particles—remove the retarding effect of the inclusions on
grain growth in metals. An excellent example is shown in Fig. 8.36 where grain-growth
data are plotted on log-log coordinates. A plot of this type for data that conform to an
equation of the form
D/H11005k(t)n8.18
gives a straight line, the slope of which is the grain-growth exponent n. In this alloy of alu-
minum containing 1.1 percent manganese, a second phase (MnAl6) exists up to a temper-
ature of 898 K, but dissolves at temperatures above 923 K, so that only a single solid
solution remains. The effect of the inclusions on the grain growth is evident. At 898 K and
below, grain growth is almost completely stopped ( nis of the order of 0.02); on the otherSecond-phase

hand, at 923 K, grain growth occurs very rapidly, with a grain-growth exponent (0.42) close
to the theoretical 0.5. The curved upper part of the curve, corresponding to the 923 K data,
is the result of a geometrical effect that will be explained in the next section.
Holes or pores in a metal can have the same effect on grain-boundary motion as 
second-phase inclusions. This is clearly shown in the photograph of Fig. 8.37 where the
cross-section of a small metal magnet made of Remalloy (12 percent Co, 17 percent Mo,
and 71 percent Fe) can be seen. This specimen was made by the powder metallurgy
technique involving the heating of a compressed metal compact to a temperature below
the melting point of the metals contained in the compact, but sufﬁciently high to weld
and diffuse the particles together. The sample presented in Fig. 8.37 has a structure con-
sisting of a single homogeneous solid solution. A number of pores are clearly visible in
the photograph, and at a number of them it can be seen that crystal boundaries have0.2 0.04 0.06 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.6 1.0 2.0 4.0

been held up by the pores. As an example, the nearly horizontal boundary of the very
large grain that occupies the upper part of the picture passes through three pores. Themotion of this boundary was toward the bottom. Observe how the boundary is curvedback toward the pore in each case.
The effect of impurities on grain growth can be summarized as follows. Solute
atoms in solid solution can form grain-boundary atmospheres, the presence of whichretards the normal surface-tension induced boundary motion. In order for theboundary to move, it must carry its atmosphere along with it. On the other hand,solute atoms in the form of second-phase impurities can also interact with theboundaries. In this case, the boundary must pull itself through the inclusions that liein its path. In either case, an increase in temperature lowers the retarding effect ofthe solute atoms and grain growth occurs under conditions more closely resemblingthe growth of soap cells.
8.26 THE FREE-SURFACE EFFECTS
Specimen geometry may play a part in controlling the rate of grain growth. Grainboundaries near any free surface of a metal specimen tend to lie perpendicular to thespecimen surface, which has the effect of reducing the net curvature of the boundariesnext to the surface. This means that the curvature becomes cylindrical rather thanspherical and, in general, cylindrical surfaces move at a slower rate than spherical sur-faces with the same radius of curvature. The reason for this difference may be under-stood in terms of the soap-bubble analogy where it is easily shown that the pressuredifference across a cylindrical surface is 2 g/Rand across a spherical surface 4 g/R, where
gis the surface tension of a soap ﬁlm and Rthe radius of the curvature.
Mullins has pointed out the importance of another phenomenon associated with grain
boundaries that meet a free surface. It probably is of greater importance in its effect ongrain growth than the reduction of the curvature of boundaries at a surface. The phenom-enon in question is thermal grooving . At the high temperatures normally associated with
annealing, grooves may form on the surfaces where grain boundaries intersect the speci-men surface. These channels are a direct result of surface-tension factors. (See Fig. 8.38.)Point ain this ﬁgure represents the line where three surfaces meet: the grain boundary
and the free surfaces to the right and left of point arespectively. In order to balance the
vertical components of the surface tensions in the three surfaces that meet at this line, agroove must form with a dihedral angle uthat satisﬁes the relation

where g
bis the surface tension of the grain boundary, and gf.s.that of the two free
surfaces. Diffusion of atoms over the free surfaces is believed to be the most impor-tant factor involved in the transport of atoms out of the grooved regions during theformation of the grooves.
Grain-boundary grooves are important in grain growth because they tend to
anchor the ends of the grain boundaries (where they meet the surface), especially ifthe boundaries are nearly normal to the surface. This anchoring effect can beexplained in a very qualitative fashion with the aid of Fig. 8.39. The left-hand figurerepresents a boundary attached to its groove, while the right-hand figure shows thegb/H110052g f.s.cos u

same boundary moved to the right and freed from its groove. Freeing this boundary
from its groove increases the total surface area and, therefore, the total surface energy.
To free the boundary from its groove requires work and, as a result, the groove
restrains the movement of the boundary.
When the average grain size of a metal specimen is very small compared to the
dimensions of the specimen, thermal grooving, or the lack of curvature in the surface
grains, has little effect on the overall rate of growth. However, when the grain
size approaches the dimensions of the thickness of the specimen, it can be expected that
grain-growth rates will be decreased. In this respect, it has been estimated20from exper-
imental data that when the grain size of metal sheets becomes larger than one-tenth the
thickness, the growth rate decreases. It is just this effect that explains the divergence of
the curve for the 923 K data in Fig. 8.36 from a straight line at times greater than
625 min. The size of the specimens used in these experiments was small. When the aver-
age grain size became larger than approximately 1.8 mm, grain growth was retarded
because of the free-surface effect.
8.27 THE LIMITING GRAIN SIZE
In the preceding section it was pointed out that the specimen dimensions can
influence the rate of grain growth when the average crystal size approaches the
thickness of the specimen. In many cases, this situation can have the effect of put-
ting a practical upper limit on the grain size; that is, the growth may be slowed down
to the point where it appears that no further growth is possible. In extreme cases,
this free-surface effect can completely stop grain growth. Consider the case of a wire
in which the grains have become so large that their boundaries cross the crystal in

255 8.27 The Limiting Grain Size
the manner shown in Fig. 8.40. Boundaries of this nature have no curvature and
cannot migrate under the action of surface-tension forces. Further grain growth isthen not possible.
Second-phase inclusions are also known to put an upper limit on the grain size of a
metal. Here it can be considered that the boundary has trapped so many inclusions thatthe surface-tension force, which is small due to its lack of sufﬁcient curvature, cannotovercome the restraining force of the inclusions.
Metal grain boundaries differ from soap ﬁlms for they possess only a single surface,
whereas the latter have two surfaces. With this in mind, the driving force per unit area forgrain-boundary movement ( /H9004pin the analogous soap bubble case) can be written in the
following manner:
8.20
where his the force per unit area, gthe surface tension of the grain boundary, and Rthe
net radius of curvature of the boundary. At the point where the grain boundary is nolonger able to pull itself away from its inclusions, the restraining force of the inclusionsmust equal the above force. This restraining force is equal to that of a single particle timesthe number of particles per unit area, or
8.21
where n
sis the number of inclusions per unit area and rthe radius of the particles. Let us
assume that the inclusions are uniformly distributed throughout the metal, then theapproximate number of these inclusions that can be expected to be holding back a surfaceof area Aare those whose centers lie inside a volume with an area Aand whose thickness
equals twice the radius of the particles. This volume 2 Arwill hold 2 n

is the number of particles per unit volume, and it is concluded that the number of particlesper unit area equals 2 n

particle. If these last two quantities are substituted into the equation that relates the driv-ing force for boundary movement to the retarding force of the inclusions, Zener’s relation-ship is obtained:

where ris the radius of the inclusions, Rthe radius of curvature of the average grain,
and zthe volume fraction of inclusions. This relationship assumes spherical particles
and a uniform distribution of particles, neither of which can be realized in an actual
metal. Nevertheless, it gives us a first approximation of the effect of inclusions ongrain growth. Since we can assume that the radius of curvature is directly propor-tional to the average grain size, this equation shows that the ultimate grain size to beexpected in the presence of inclusions is directly dependent on the size of theinclusions.
8.28 PREFERRED ORIENTATION
Other factors in addition to grain-boundary atmospheres, second-phase inclusions, andthe free-surface effects are known to affect the measured rate of grain growth. Amongthese is a preferred orientation of the crystal structure. By a preferred orientation onesigniﬁes a nearly identical orientation in all the crystals of a given sample of metal.When this situation occurs, it has been generally observed that grain-growth rates arereduced.
8.29 SECONDARY RECRYSTALLIZATION
In a previous section it was pointed out that it is frequently possible to obtain a limitinggrain size in a metal. When this grain-growth inhibition occurs as a result of the presenceof inclusions, the size effects, or from the development of a strong preferred orientation,a secondary recrystallization is often possible. This secondary recrystallization behaves inmuch the same manner as the primary one and is usually induced by raising the anneal-ing temperature above that at which the original grain growth occurred. After a nucle-ation period, some of the crystals start to grow at the expense of their neighbors. Thecauses for the nucleation are not entirely clear but grain coalescence could well producethis effect. It is relatively easy to understand the growth that occurs once it starts, for theenlarged crystals quickly become grains with a large number of sides as they consumetheir smaller neighbors. As mentioned earlier, grains with many sides possess boundariesthat are concave away from their centers and, consequently, the grains become larger insize. Secondary recrystallization is really a case of exaggerated grain growth occurring asa result of surface-energy considerations, rather than as a result of the strain energy ofcold work that is responsible for primary recrystallization.
Figure 8.41 is a good illustration of secondary recrystallization. In the center of the pho-
tograph, one sees a large grain with 13 sides, all of which are concave away from the cen-ter of the crystal. The specimen shown in the ﬁgure is the same as that of Fig. 8.37.The latter also shows a large grain growing at the expense of its neighbors (that occupyingthe top of the ﬁgure).
Very large grains, or even single crystals, can sometimes be grown by secondary
recrystallization because the number of grains that finally results depends only on thenumber of secondary nuclei. Growth-inhibiting factors that control the grain growthafter primary recrystallization, such as inclusions and free surfaces, do not control thegrowth of grains in secondary recrystallization. In the latter case, as in primary recrys-tallization, the nuclei grow until the matrix is completely recrystallized.08Ch08.qxd   11/6/08  4:33 PM  Page 256
257 8.30 Strain-Induced Boundary Migration
8.30 STRAIN-INDUCED BOUNDARY MIGRATION
While it is generally conceded that normal grain growth occurs as a result of the surface
energy stored in the grain boundaries, it is also possible for crystals to grow as a result ofstrain energy induced in the lattice by cold work. Strain-induced boundary migrationshould not be expected in a metal after complete recrystallization unless it has been dis-torted either by handling after recrystallization, or by residual strains caused by unevenrates of recrystallization in different parts of the specimen.
Strain-induced boundary movements differ from recrystallization in that no new
crystals are formed. Rather, the boundaries between pairs of grains move so as to increasethe size of one grain of a pair while causing the other to disappear. As the movementoccurs, the boundary leaves behind a crystalline region which is lower in its strain energy.In contrast to surface-tension-induced grain-boundary migration, this form of boundarymovement occurs in such a manner that the boundary usually moves away from its cen-ter of curvature. This movement is shown schematically in Fig. 8.42, where the movinggrain boundary is shown with an irregular curved shape. The irregular form of a bound-ary that grows as a consequence of strain energy can be explained by assuming that therate of motion is a function of the strain magnitude in the metal. The boundary shouldmove faster into those regions where the distortion has been greatest. One of the inter-esting aspects of strain-induced boundary migrations is that instead of the boundary ofthe moving grain lowering its surface energy through the movement, it may actuallyincrease it by increasing its area.
Strain-induced migration of boundaries only occurs after relatively small or moderate
amounts of cold work. Too great a degree of deformation will bring about normal recrys-tallization. On the other hand, this form of boundary movement can be induced in sheetspecimens where the normal grain growth has been inhibited by the size effects previouslydiscussed.

PROBLEMS
8.1In Sec. 8.1, it was stated that a high-purity Cu spec-
imen, after 30 percent deformation at room tempera-
ture, was found to have a recoverable strain energy of
about 25 J/g-mol. The Burgers vector for Cu is 0.256 nm
and the shear modulus about 5.46 /H110031010Pa. Determine
the dislocation density of an array of uniformly distrib-
uted alternating right- and left-hand screw dislocations

energy.

8.4A well known equation, which treats a crystal as an
isotropic elastic solid, was developed in the early days
of dislocation theory to predict the surface energy of a
low-angle tilt boundary. Basically it assumes that the
strain field of an individual edge dislocation is neutral-
ized by the fields of the dislocations above and below it,
in the boundary, and at a distance from the boundary
equal to approximately one-half the spacing between
the dislocations in the boundary. The derivation of this
equation is given in most texts on dislocations. The

8.5One of the phenomena during the latter stages of
recovery is the coalescence of tilt boundaries into a single
tilt boundary with a larger tilt angle. This is accompanied
by a loss of surface energy. Compute the fractional loss of
surface energy when two tilt boundaries with tilt angles
of 0.5° combine to form a 1.0° tilt boundary. (Use the
parameters of Prob. 8.4.)

and write a program that allows the value of the temper-ature, T, to be substituted into the equation and also con-
tains a (FOR—NEXT) LOOP that varies the time, t, from 
0 to 120 min. in steps of 30 min. The purpose is to obtainfour values of D

program against the 973 K (700°C) data in Fig. 8.30 andthen use it to determine a set of D

9.1 SOLID SOLUTIONS
When homogeneous mixtures of two or more kinds of atoms occur in the solid state, they
are known as solid solutions. These solutions are quite common and are equivalent to liq-
uid and gaseous forms, for the proportions of the components can be varied within ﬁxedlimits, and the mixtures do not separate naturally. The term solvent refers to the more
abundant atomic form, and solute to the less abundant. These solutions are also usually
crystalline.
Solid solutions occur in either of two distinct types. The ﬁrst is known as a substitu-
tional solid solution . In this case, a direct substitution of one type of atom for another
occurs so that solute atoms enter the crystal to take positions normally occupied by sol-vent atoms. Figure 9.1A shows schematically an example containing two kinds of atoms(Cu and Ni). The other type of solid solution is shown in Fig. 9.1B. Here the solute atom(carbon) does not displace a solvent atom, but, rather, enters one of the holes, or inter-stices, between the solvent (iron) atoms. This type of solution is known as an interstitial
solid solution .
9.2 INTERMEDIATE PHASES
In many alloy systems, crystal structures or phases are found that are different from thoseof the elementary components (pure metals). If these structures occur over a range ofcompositions, they are, in all respects, solid solutions. However, when the new crystalstructures occur with simple whole-number ﬁxed ratios of the component atoms, they areintermetallic compounds with stoichiometric compositions.
The difference between intermediate solid solutions and compounds can be more eas-
ily understood by actual examples. When copper and zinc are alloyed to form brass, anumber of new structures are formed in different composition ranges. Most of these occurin compositions which have no commercial value whatsoever, but that which occurs at aratio of approximately one zinc atom to one of copper is found in some useful forms ofbrass. The crystal structure of this new phase is body-centered cubic, whereas that of cop-per is face-centered cubic, and zinc is close-packed hexagonal. Because this body-centeredcubic structure can exist over a range of compositions (it is the only stable phase at roomtemperature between 47 and 50 weight percent of zinc), it is not a compound, but a solidsolution. This is also sometimes called a nonstoichiometric compound or a nonstoichio-metric intermetallic compound. On the other hand, when carbon is added to iron in anamount exceeding a small fraction of one-thousandth of a percent at ambient tempera-tures (see Fig. 9.3), a deﬁnite intermetallic compound is observed. This compound has aﬁxed composition (6.67 weight percent of carbon) and a complex crystal structure(orthorhombic, with 12 iron atoms and 4 carbon atoms per unit cell) which is quite dif-ferent from that of either iron (body-centered cubic) or carbon (graphite).

A binary alloy system may contain both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric com-
pounds. For example, aluminum and nickel alloys contain ﬁve nickel aluminide interme-
diate phases designated as Al3Ni, Al3Ni2, AlNi and Al3Ni5, and AlNi3. The ﬁrst intermediate
phase, Al3Ni, has a ﬁxed stoichiometric composition of 75 at. % Al and 25 at. % Ni. The
other compounds, on the other hand, are nonstoichiometric.
9.3 INTERSTITIAL SOLID SOLUTIONS
An examination of Fig. 9.1B shows that solute atoms in interstitial alloys must be small
in size. The conditions that determine the solubilities in both interstitial and substitu-
tional alloy systems have been studied in great detail by Hume-Rothery and others.
According to their results, extensive interstitial solid solutions occur only if the solute
atom has an apparent diameter smaller than 0.59 that of the solvent. The four most
important interstitial solute atoms are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, all of
which are small in size.
Atomic size is not the only factor that determines whether or not an interstitial solid
solution will form. Small interstitial solute atoms dissolve much more readily in transition
metals than in other metals. In fact, we ﬁnd that carbon is so insoluble in most nontran-
sition metals that graphite-clay crucibles are frequently used for melting them. Some of
the commercially important transition metals are
Iron Vanadium Tungsten
Titanium Chromium Thorium
Zirconium Manganese Uranium
Nickel Molybdenum
The ability of transition elements to dissolve interstitial atoms is believed to be due to
their unusual electronic structure. All transition elements possess an incomplete electronic
shell inside of the outer, or valence, electron shell. The nontransitional metals, on the
other hand, have ﬁlled shells below the valency shell.
The extent to which interstitial atoms can dissolve in the transition metals depends on
the metal in question, but it is usually small. On the other hand, interstitial atoms can09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 262

occupied by carbon atomsdiffuse easily through the lattice of the solvent and their effects on the properties of the
solvent are larger than might otherwise be expected. Diffusion, in this case, occurs not by
a vacancy mechanism, but by the solute atoms jumping from one interstitial position 
to another.
9.4 SOLUBILITY OF CARBON IN BODY-CENTERED CUBIC IRON
Let us consider a speciﬁc interstitial solid solution, carbon in body-centered cubic iron, and
conﬁne our attention to temperatures below 1000 K. This restriction is applied so that we
do not have to concern ourselves with considerations of the face-centered cubic form of
iron, which is stable at temperatures as low as 1000 K in the presence of carbon.
The solubility of carbon in body-centered cubic iron is low. In fact, the number of car-
bon atoms in an iron crystal is roughly equivalent to the number of vacancies found in
crystals. It is therefore possible to deduce an equation for the equilibrium number of car-
bon atoms in an iron crystal. There are, however, signiﬁcant differences between the two
cases, as will be shown. The iron-carbon case will now be considered.
The positions marked with an xin Fig. 9.2 are those that carbon atoms take when they
enter the iron lattice. They lie either midway between two corner atoms or in the centers of
the faces of the cube, where they are midway between two atoms located at the centers of
unit cells. In the diamond lattice, the carbon atom has an apparent diameter of 0.1541 nm.
However, Fig. 9.2B shows that the lattice constant of iron (length of one edge of the unit cell)
is 0.2866 nm. The diameter of the iron atom is, accordingly, 0.2481 nm, and another simple
calculation shows that the width of the hole occupied by carbon atoms is only 0.0385 nm. It
is quite apparent that the carbon atom does not ﬁt well into the body-centered cubic crystal
of iron. The lattice in the vicinity of each solute atom is badly strained, and work must be done
in order to introduce the interstitial atom into the crystal.
Let us designate this work by the symbol wc. If ncis the number of carbon atoms in an
iron crystal, the internal energy of the crystal (in the presence of carbon atoms) will be
increased by the amount ncwc.
Each interstitial atom increases the entropy of the crystal in the same manner that each
vacancy does. This form of entropy increment is known as an intrinsic entropy. This intrinsic
entropy arises from the fact that the introduction of an interstitial atom affects the normal
modes of lattice vibrations. The solute atom distorts the orderly array of iron atoms and this,
in turn, makes the thermal vibrations of the crystal more random, or irregular. The total
entropy contribution from this source is ncsc, where scis the intrinsic entropy per carbon atom.09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 263
Chapter 9 Solid Solutions 264
In the derivation of the equation for the equilibrium number of vacancies in a crystal,
the intrinsic entropy of the vacancies nvsvwas neglected. However, if it had been incorpo-
rated in the expression for the free energy associated with the presence of vacancies, the
solution of the problem would have been no more difﬁcult. In that case, the ﬁnal resultwould have had the form

expressed as follows:

where Bis a constant, Qfis the enthalpy or energy to introduce a mole of vacancies

Now, with reference to carbon atoms in an iron crystal, it should be noted that the
mixing of carbon atoms and iron atoms to form a solid solution involves an entropyof mixing. The calculation of this mixing entropy, however, differs from that used for themixing entropy associated with vacancies in a crystal lattice because vacancies andatoms interchange positions, while carbon atoms do not interchange with iron atoms.In fact, the iron atoms can be assumed to remain ﬁxed in space as far as the movementsof carbon atoms are concerned. This is because below 1000 K the jump rate of ironatoms into vacancies becomes negligible compared to the jump rate of carbon atomsbetween interstitial sites. The entropy of mixing associated with the carbon atomsinvolves only the distribution of the carbon atoms in the interstitial sites. As may bededuced with the aid of Fig. 9.2, there are three interstitial sites per Fe atom in the bcciron lattice. Thus, there are two Fe atoms per unit cell as shown in Sec. 1.4, and if oneexamines the bcc unit cell, it will be found that there are twelve interstitial sites likethose shown in Fig. 9.2. Each of these, however, belongs to two cells so that there aresix per unit cell. Thus, 6/2 gives 3 sites per Fe atom. The mixing entropy thus involvesthe distribution of n

Now let us consider the physical signiﬁcance of wc, which has been deﬁned as the
work required to introduce a carbon atom into an interstitial position. This element ofwork depends upon the source of the carbon atoms, which in alloys of pure iron and car-bon can be either graphite crystals or iron-carbide crystals. In either case, the crystals thatsupply the carbon atoms are assumed to be in intimate contact with the iron. The mostimportant of these two sources of carbon is iron-carbide, for commercial steels are almostuniversally aggregates of iron and iron-carbide. Graphite rarely appears in steels, eventhough it represents a more stable phase than iron-carbide.

However, the rate of this decomposition is extremely slow in the temperature range of
normal steel usage, and, for all practical purposes, Fe3C may be considered a stable phase.)
In metallurgical terminology, iron-carbide is called cementite , and the interstitial solid
solution of carbon in body-centered cubic iron is known as ferrite . These terms will be used
in the following sections of the book.
According to Chipman,1the experimentally determined activation energy Qcfor the
transfer of a mole of carbon atoms from cementite to ferrite is 77,300 J per mole. At the
same time Chipman gives the corresponding value for graphite to ferrite as 106,300 J per
mole. The work to take a carbon atom from graphite and place it interstitially in iron is
therefore greater than the work to take it from iron-carbide and place it in iron. This, of
course, has an effect on the equllibrium number of carbon atoms in the iron lattice. The
solubility of carbon in ferrite is lower when the iron is in equilibrium with graphite than
when it is in equilibrium with cementite, because a greater energy is required to remove
an atom from graphite and place it in the iron. The solubility equation
Cc/H11005Be2Qc/H20862RT 9.13
can be evaluated in terms of the data reported in Chipman’s paper, which speciﬁcally apply
to the case of ferrite in equilibrium with cementite (that is, where the interstitial atoms are
supplied by iron-carbide). If this is done, we obtain

where R/H110058.314 J per mole-K.
Figure 9.3 shows a plot of the equilibrium carbon concentration between room tem-
perature and 727°C (1000 K). The curve clearly shows that the solubility of carbon in fer-
rite is very small. The equilibrium value at room temperature is only 8.5 /H1100310/H1100212weight
percent, or one part in 8.5 /H1100310/H1100214by weight. This is equivalent to an atom fraction of 
4/H1100310/H1100213, or a mean separation between solute atoms of 3,000 solvent atoms. Figure 9.3
also shows the temperature dependence of the equilibrium number of carbon atoms. 
At 727°C the carbon concentration reaches its maximum value, 0.022 percent. In this case,09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 266
267 9.6 Interaction of Dislocations and Solute Atoms
there is about one carbon atom for every 1000 iron atoms, or a separation equivalent to
approximately 10 solvent atoms between carbon atoms.
9.5 SUBSTITUTIONAL SOLID SOLUTIONS AND 
THE HUME-ROTHERY RULES
In Figure 9.1A, the copper and nickel atoms are drawn with the same diameters. Actually,the atoms in a crystal of pure copper have an apparent diameter (0.2551 nm) about 2 percent larger than those in a crystal of pure nickel (0.2487 nm). This difference is smalland only a slight distortion of the lattice occurs when a copper atom enters a nickel crys-tal, or vice versa, and it is not surprising that these two elements are able to crystallizesimultaneously into a face-centered cubic lattice in all proportions. Nickel and copper forman excellent example of an alloy series of complete solubility.
Silver, like copper and nickel, crystallizes in the face-centered cubic structure. It is
also chemically similar to copper. However, the solubility of copper in silver, or silverin copper, equals only a fraction of 1 percent at room temperature. There is, thus, afundamental difference between the copper-nickel systems and the copper-silver sys-tems. This dissimilarity is due primarily to a greater difference in the relative sizes ofthe atoms in the copper-silver alloys. The apparent diameter of silver is 0.2884 nm, orabout 13 percent larger than that of copper. It is thus very close to the limit noted ﬁrstby Hume-Rothery, who pointed out that an extensive solid solubility of one metal inanother only occurs if the diameters of the metals differ by less than 15 percent. Thiscriterion for solubility is known as the size factor and is directly related to the strains
produced in the lattice of the solvent by the solute atoms.
The size factor is only a necessary condition for a high degree of solubility. It is
not a sufficient condition, since other requirements must be satisfied. One of themost important requirements is the relative positions of the elements in the electro-motive series. (This series may normally be found in either a general chemistry textor an elementary book on the subject of corrosion.) Two elements, which lie far apartin this series, do not, as a rule, alloy in the normal sense, but combine according tothe rules of chemical valence. In this case, the more electropositive element yields itsvalence electrons to the more electronegative element, with the result that a crystalwith ionic bonding is formed. A typical example of this type of crystal is found inNaCl. On the other hand, when metals lie close to each other in the electromotiveseries, they tend to act as if they were chemically the same, which leads to metallicbonding instead of ionic.
Two other factors are of importance, especially when one considers a completely sol-
uble system. Even if the size factor and electromotive series positions are favorable, sucha system is only possible when both components (pure metals) have the same valence, andcrystallize in the same lattice form. More detailed discussion of Hume-Rothery rules canbe found in Reference 2 listed at the end of the chapter.
9.6 INTERACTION OF DISLOCATIONS AND SOLUTE ATOMS
A dislocation is a crystal defect the presence of which in a crystal means that large num-bers of atoms have been displaced from their normal lattice positions. This displacementof the atoms around the center of a dislocation results in a complex two-dimensional strainpattern with the dislocation line at its center.09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 267

stresses, one compressive and one tensile, aligned at 45° to the shear
stresses9.7 DISLOCATION ATMOSPHERES
When a crystal contains both dislocations and solute atoms, interactions may occur. Of
particular interest is the interaction between substitutional solutes and dislocations in
the edge orientation. If the diameter of a solute atom is either larger or smaller than
that of the solvent atom, the lattice of the latter is strained. A large solute atom expands
the surrounding lattice, while a small one contracts it. These distortions may be largely
relieved if the solute atom ﬁnds itself in the proper place close to the center of a dislo-
cation. Thus, the free energy of the crystal will be lowered when a small solute atom is
substituted for a larger solvent atom in the compressed region of a dislocation in, or
close to, the extra plane of the dislocation. (See Fig. 4.38). In fact, it can be shown by
computations that the stress ﬁeld of the dislocation attracts small solvent atoms to
this area. Similarly, large solute atoms are drawn to lattice positions below the edge
(i.e., the expanded region of the dislocation).
Substitutional atoms do not react strongly with dislocations in the screw orientation
where the strain ﬁeld is nearly pure shear. The lattice distortion associated with substitu-
tional atoms can be assumed to be spherical in shape. Figure 9.4 shows that a state of pure
shear is equivalent to two equal normal strains (principal strains)—one tensile and one
compressive. Lattice strains of this type will not react strongly with the spherical strain
associated with substitutional solute atoms.
Now consider the interaction of interstitial atoms and dislocations. Interstitial atoms
can react with the edge orientations of dislocations since they normally cause an expan-
sion of the solvent lattice. As a result, interstitial atoms are drawn toward the expanded
regions of edge dislocations. Also, because of the nonspherical lattice distortions that inter-
stitial atoms produce in body-centered cubic metals, they are capable of reacting with the
screw components of dislocations in this type of lattice. An example has already been cited
when it was shown that the carbon atom enters a restricted space between a pair of iron
atoms and shoves them apart. (See Fig. 9.2.) Since, in the body-centered cubic lattice, the
atom pairs referred to always lie along the edges of the unit cells or at the centers of two
adjacent unit cells, the distortions (expansions) are in /H20855100 /H20856directions. A nonspherical
lattice distortion such as this will react with the shear strain ﬁeld of a screw dislocation as
follows. In those regions close to a screw dislocation where a /H20855100 /H20856direction lies close to09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 268
269 9.8 The Formation of a Dislocation Atmosphere
the principal tensile strain of the dislocation’s strain ﬁeld (Fig. 9.4), the holes separating
iron-atom pairs lying along this direction will be enlarged. Carbon atoms will naturallyseek these enlarged interstitial positions.
Solute atoms are drawn toward dislocations as a result of the interactions of their
strain ﬁelds. However, the rate at which the solute atoms move under these attractiveforces is controlled by the rate at which they can diffuse through the lattice. At high tem-peratures, diffusion rates are rapid, and solute atoms concentrate quickly around disloca-tions. If the solute atoms have a mutual attraction, the precipitation of a second crystallinephase may start at dislocations. In this case, dislocations act as sinks for solute atoms, andthe ﬂow can be assumed to be in one direction—toward the dislocations. Movements ofthis nature can be expected to continue until the solute concentration in the crystal isdepleted (lowered to the point where it is in equilibrium with the newly formed phase).On the other hand, if the solute atoms do not combine to form a new phase, an equilib-rium state should develop, with equal numbers of solute atoms entering and leaving aﬁnite volume containing a dislocation. Under these conditions, a steady-state concentra-tion of solute atoms builds up around the dislocation which is higher than that of the sur-rounding lattice. This excess of solute atoms associated with a dislocation is known as itsatmosphere . The number of atoms in the atmosphere depends on the temperature.
Increasing the temperature tends to tear solute atoms away from dislocations and toincrease the entropy of the crystal. Increasing temperatures thus lowers the solute concen-trations around dislocations, and at a suffciently high temperature, the concentrations canbe lowered to the point where it can be considered that dislocation atomospheres nolonger exist.
9.8 THE FORMATION OF A DISLOCATION ATMOSPHERE
A simple theory rationalizing the kinetics of solute atom movements in the stressﬁeldof an edge dislocation was proposed by Cottrell and Bilby
3in 1949. Their theory
assumed that a difference in size between the substitutional solute atoms and thesolvent atoms should result in strains in the lattice centered at the solute atoms. Whena solute atom lies in the stress-ﬁeld of a dislocation, an interaction energy between thesolute atom and the dislocation should occur. Following Cottrell,
4this interaction
energy is computed as follows. It is ﬁrst assumed that the crystal can be treated as anisotropic elastic solid so that isotropic elasticity theory may be used and the strainassociated with the solute atom has spherical symmetry. The effective radial strain of asolute atom is then taken as
9.16
where r/H11032is the radius of the solute atom and rthat of the solvent atom. The volume strain
was then computed by multiplying the surface area of a sphere of radius r(i.e., 4 pr
2) by
/H9004r, where by Eq. 9.16, /H9004r/H11005/H9255r. This gives a volume strain of 4 p/H9255r3. The interaction energy
was then obtained by multiplying the volume strain by the hydrostatic stress of thedislocation at the solute atom. This hydrostatic stress equals

The above calculation gives the interaction energy between a solute atom and an edge
dislocation in a substitutional solid solution. The interaction energy between an interstitial
solute atom and an edge dislocation in a bcc metal can also be evaluated using Eq. 9.20.However, the calculation of Ais more complicated because the strain in the lattice due to
the interstitial atom does not have spherical symmetry. It has a tetragonal symmetry. Anexample of this type of solid solution is carbon steel, which normally contains interstitialcarbon atoms dissolved in the bcc iron lattice. The calculation of the interaction constantfor this case will not be covered here. The original calculations of Cottrell and Bilby gaveA/H110053.0/H1100310

9.10 THE DRAG OF ATMOSPHERES ON MOVING DISLOCATIONS
Consider an edge dislocation in a body-centered cubic metal such as iron. Directly abovethe dislocation line the compressive stress that exists there tends to lower the carbon ornitrogen atom concentration to a value below that existing in the crystal as a whole. At the same time, the tensile stress below the dislocation attracts these interstitial soluteatoms. The dislocation atmosphere around an edge dislocation therefore consists of anexcess concentration of interstitial atoms below the edge, and a deﬁciency of these atomsabove the edge.
When such a dislocation moves at a high enough temperature so that solute atoms are
very mobile, its atmosphere tends to move with it. The movement of a dislocation awayfrom its atmosphere creates an effective stress on the solute atoms that draws them backtoward their equilibrium distribution. This motion can only occur by thermally activatedjumps of the atoms from one interstitial position to another. As a result, the atmospheretends to lag behind the dislocation. At the same time, the distribution of the atoms in theatmosphere also changes. This is because the structure of the atmosphere is now inﬂu-enced by several additional factors. The most important of these is probably that themovement of the dislocation through the crystal tends to bring additional solute atomsinto the atmosphere. At the same time, a corresponding number of solute atoms mustleave the atmosphere on the side opposite to the direction of motion. In this process, it canbe considered that the movement of the dislocation through the crystal tends to realignthose solute atoms lying just above its slip plane into positions below its slip plane. Theatmosphere associated with a moving dislocation is thus a dynamic concept, but its exis-tence can have a strong inﬂuence on the motion of a dislocation.
Now let us consider how the atmosphere affects the motion of a dislocation. The inter-
action stress between the solute atoms in the atmosphere and the dislocation makes itmore difﬁcult to move the dislocation, and this stress has to be overcome in order toadvance the dislocation. The drag-stress due to a dislocation atmosphere is therefore oneof the important components of the ﬂow-stress of a metal. This stress component is afunction of the dislocation velocity. The qualitative nature of its dependence on the veloc-ity can be easily visualized. At both very high and very low velocities the drag-stress hasto be very small. At extremely high dislocation velocities the dislocation passes by thesolute atoms at such a fast rate that there is insufﬁcient time for the atoms to rearrange09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 271

obstacles through which the dislocation moves. An atmosphere of solute atoms should not
exist under these conditions. On the other hand, when the dislocation is at rest there exists
no net stress between the dislocation and its atmosphere. If the dislocation is now given a
small velocity, the center of its atmosphere will move to a position behind the dislocation.
The distance of separation between the dislocation and the effective center of its atmos-
phere increases with increasing velocity. Computations6indicate that this causes an
increase in the drag-stress that is proportional to the dislocation velocity. However, even-
tually a maximum drag-stress should be reached, since at very large velocities the atmos-
phere itself becomes less and less well-deﬁned. Figure 9.6A shows the nature of this
dependence of the drag-stress on the dislocation velocity.
It is appropriate now to consider the effect of temperature on the drag-stress disloca-
tion velocity relationship. The drag-stress is, in effect, a manifestation of a coupling between
a moving dislocation and a set of interstitial atoms that also must move in order to both
form and maintain the atmosphere. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the maximum
drag-stress corresponds to a direct relationship between the dislocation velocity and the dif-
fusion rate of the solute atoms. Increasing the temperature increases the rate at which the
solute atoms move and, as a result, the dislocation velocity corresponding to a maximum
drag-stress also has to increase. This is shown in Fig. 9.6B. Note that at the higher temper-
ature the critical velocity ycis higher. However, the maximum drag-stress sdmremains the
same. This is in agreement with the theoretical treatment of Cottrell and Jaswon.
By the Orowan equation, we have . Therefore, at a constant dislocation den-
sity, the average dislocation velocity should be directly proportional to the strain rate.
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that when deformation occurs at a nearly constant/H11080g/H11005 rby09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 272

strain curve for a metal that does not exhibit a

ﬂow-stress should be similar to that shown in Fig. 9.6C. ﬁnally, because of the interrela-
tionship between strain rate and temperature, it may be deduced that a similar relation-
ship exists between the temperature and the drag-stress when the strain rate is held
constant. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.6D. Note that in this case the temperature decreases
as the abscissa coordinate increases. This is because a very low temperature at a constant
strain rate is equivalent to a high strain rate at a constant temperature. In either case, the
solute becomes immobile with respect to the moving dislocation. The results of recent
modeling calculations using a phase-ﬁeld model also indicate that the average velocity of
dislocations depends on the ratio of the solute mobility to dislocation mobility.7
9.11 THE SHARP YIELD POINT AND LÜDERS BANDS
When the stress-strain curves of metals deformed in tension are plotted, two basic types of
curves are observed, as shown in Fig. 9.7. The curve on the left exhibits what is known as a
sharp yield point . In this curve, the stress rises with insigniﬁcant plastic deformation to point a,
the upper yield point. At this point, the material begins to yield, with a simultaneous drop in
the ﬂow-stress required for continued deformation. This new yield stress, point b, is called the
lower yield point and corresponds to an appreciable plastic strain at an almost constant stress.
Eventually the metal starts to harden with an increase in the stress necessary for additional
deformation. After this occurs, there is little difference between the appearance of the stress-
strain curves for metals with a yield point and those without it.
The sharp yield point is an especially important effect because it occurs in iron and in
low-carbon steels. Its existence is of considerable concern to manufacturers who stamp or
draw thin sheets of these materials in forming such objects as automobile bodies. The
signiﬁcance of the yield point is this: once plastic deformation starts in a given area, the
metal at this point is effectively softened and suffers a relatively large plastic deformation.
This deformation then spreads into the material adjoining the region, which has yielded
because of the stress concentration at the boundary between the deformed and undeformed
areas. In general, deformation starts at positions of stress concentration as discrete bands of
deformed material, called Lüders bands . In the usual tensile test specimen (Fig. 9.8), the ﬁl-
lets are stress raisers and points at which Lüders bands form. The edges of these bands make
approximately 50° angles with the stress axis and are designated Lüders lines . Lüders bands
should not be confused with slip lines. It is quite possible to have hundreds of crystals coop-
erating to form a Lüders band, each slipping in a complicated fashion on its own slip planes.
Once a Lüders band has formed at one ﬁllet of a tensile test specimen, it can then move09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 273

through the gage length of the specimen. The bands can form simultaneously at both ends
of a tensile test specimen, or even, under certain conditions, at a number of positions
throughout the specimen gage length. In any case, the deformation starts at localized areas
and spreads into undeformed areas. This occurs at an almost constant stress and explains
the horizontal part of the stress-strain curve at the lower yield point. In fact, the lower yield
stress can be viewed as the stress required to propagate the Lüders bands. The velocity with
which a Lüders front moves increases with an increase in the applied stress. Most testing
machines tend to deform a specimen at a ﬁxed rate. If two Lüders bands move through a
specimen’s gage section, the front of each Lüders band will move at approximately half the
rate of the front of a single band. This means that the lower yield stress required to move
two fronts will be less than that required to move a single front and, in general, an increase
or decrease in the number of moving Lüders fronts must be accompanied by a correspon-
ding variation in the lower yield stress. This accounts for the ﬂuctuating lower yield stress
shown schematically in Fig. 9.7. Only after the Lüders deformation has covered the entire
gage section does the stress-strain curve start to rise again.
In the previously mentioned example of low-carbon-steel sheet used in forming auto-
mobile bodies, the effect of using metals containing a yield point is to develop roughened
surfaces. These surfaces result from the uneven spread of Lüders bands, which leave
striations on the surface commonly called stretcher strains . On the other hand, when mate-
rial without a yield point is used, work hardening instead of softening sets in as soon as
plastic deformation starts. This tends to spread deformation uniformly over large areas and
to produce smooth surfaces after deformation.
It may not be necessary to exceed all of the yield point strain in order to remove most
of the harmful effects of the Lüders phenomenon. Annealed steel sheet is often given a
slight reduction in thickness by rolling, which amounts to about a 1 percent strain. This is
called a temper roll , and it produces a very large number of Lüders band nuclei in the sheet.
When the metal is later deformed into a ﬁnished product, these small bands grow; but,
because of their small size and close proximity to each other, the resulting surface rough-
ening is greatly reduced.09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:36 PM  Page 274
275 9.12 The Theory of the Sharp Yield Point
9.12 THE THEORY OF THE SHARP YIELD POINT
It has been proposed by Cottrell4that the sharp yield point which occurs in certain metals
is a result of the interaction between dislocations and solute atoms. According to this
theory, the atmosphere of solute atoms that collect around dislocations serves to pin down,or anchor, the dislocations. Additional stress, over that normally required for movement,is needed in order to free a dislocation from its atmosphere. This results in an increase inthe stress required to set dislocations in motion, and corresponds to the upper yield-pointstress. The lower yield point in the original Cottrell theory then represents the stress tomove dislocations that have been freed from their atmospheres. It is important to notethat, in general, yield points involve interactions between dislocations and solute atoms attemperatures low enough so that the thermal mobility of the solute atoms is very low.Thus, an applied stress may pull dislocations away from their atmospheres.
All evidence points to the correctness of Cottrell’s assumption that the increase in yield
stress associated with the upper yield point is caused by the interaction of dislocations withsolute atoms. Whether or not the yield point is associated with a simple breaking away ofdislocations from their atmospheres is still in doubt. The original Cottrell theory does notsatisfactorily explain certain experimental data.
A theory of the yield point originally proposed by Johnston and Gilman
8,9to explain
yielding in LiF crystals is worth noting. In effect, this theory postulates that in a metal witha very low initial dislocation density, the ﬁrst increments of plastic strain cause anextremely large relative increase in the dislocation density. To be explicit, suppose that thedislocation density in a metal were to increase directly with the strain at a rate of about10
12m/m3per each one percent strain. If the initial dislocation density was only
108m/m3, the dislocation density would increase by a factor of about 10,000 times in the
ﬁrst one percent of strain. However, in the next one percent of strain, the density wouldonly increase by a factor of two; and for each succeeding one percent increment, therelative increase would be progressively smaller.
The Johnston-Gilman analysis shows how this rapid dislocation multiplication at the
beginning of a tensile test can produce a yield drop. The average testing machine tries todeform a tensile specimen at a constant rate. When the dislocation density is very low,the resultant strain is largely elastic, and the stress rises rapidly. Associated with thisresultant large stress is a very high dislocation velocity. At the same time, it should beremembered that the dislocation density is increasing rapidly. A high dislocation velocityand an increasing number of mobile dislocations eventually produce a point of instabil-ity where the specimen deforms plastically at the same rate as the machine. Beyond thispoint the load has to fall and, in so doing, lowers the dislocation velocity, with the resultthat the rate of decrease in the load, while rapid at ﬁrst, becomes slower and slower. Thiscontinued decrease in ﬂow-stress with strain beyond the yield point is normally maskedby the work hardening that occurs in the metal. While the Johnston-Gilman theory doesnot account for the Lüders deformation, it does give a very interesting analysis of the phe-nomenon of yielding.
In the case of iron and steel, the room-temperature yield point has been shown to
be due to either carbon or nitrogen in interstitial solid solution. An important questionis how much carbon or nitrogen is needed to form atmospheres around the disloca-tions. This can be roughly estimated in the following fashion. The number of carbonatoms in an atmosphere is not known with certainty, but can be assumed to be of theorder of 1 carbon atom per atomic distance along the dislocation.

a d c c body-centered cubic structure has a diameter of about 0.25 nm. In a dislocation 1 cm
long, there are 107nm units, or 4 /H11003107atomic distances. It can, accordingly, be
assumed that there will be 4 /H11003107carbon atoms per cm of dislocation.
The density of dislocations in a soft annealed crystal is usually about 108cm/H110022. The
corresponding number in a highly cold-worked metal is 1012, or 10,000 times as many
as in unstrained meterial.  In the soft state, the total length of all dislocations in a cubic
centimeter is 108cm, and with 4 /H11003107carbon atoms per cm, the total number of car-
bon atoms is 4 /H110031015. Let us compare this with the total number of iron atoms in the
same crystal. The length of the body-centered cubic unit cell is 0.286 nm. Thus there are
4.3/H110031022unit cells in a cubic centimeter. Since the body-centered cubic structure has
2 atoms per unit cell, the number of iron atoms is 8.6 /H110031022, or about 1023. The
concentration of carbon atoms required to form an atmosphere of 1 carbon atom per
atomic distance along a dislocation is thus:
9.23
or four carbon atoms in every hundred million iron atoms. In a heavily cold-worked crys-
tal, the same ratio would be
9.24
or about 0.04 percent. The signiﬁcance of the above ﬁgures is plain: very little carbon (or
nitrogen) is required in order to have sufﬁcient interstitial solute available to form dislo-
cation atmospheres.
9.13 STRAIN AGING
Figure 9.9A shows a tensile stress-strain curve for a metal with a sharp yield point
in which loading was stopped at point cand then the load was removed. During the
unloading stage, the stress-strain curve follows a linear path parallel to the original elas-
tic portion of the curve (line ab). On reloading within a short time (hours), the specimen
behaves elastically to approximately point c, and then deforms plastically, and no yield
point is observed. On the other hand, if the specimen is not retested for a period of some
months and during this period is allowed to age at room temperature, the yield point
reappears, as is shown in Fig. 9.9B. The aging period has raised the stress at which thenc

specimen is strengthened and hardened. This type of phenomenon, where a metal hard-
ens as a result of aging after plastic deformation, is called strain aging . The yield point that
reappears during strain aging is also associated with the formation of solute atomatmospheres around dislocations. Those dislocation sources that were active in the defor-mation process just before the specimen was unloaded are pinned down as a result of theaging process. Because solute atoms must diffuse through the lattice in order to accumu-late around dislocations, the reappearance of the yield point is a function of time. It alsodepends on the temperature, in as much as diffusion is a temperature-dependent func-tion. The higher the temperature the faster the rate at which the yield point will reap-pear. The yield point is not normally observed in iron and steels tested at elevatedtemperatures (above approximately 400°C). This fact can be explained by the tendencyfor dislocation atmospheres to be dispersed as a result of the more intense thermal vibra-tions found at elevated temperatures.
The yield point and strain aging phenomena are most closely associated with iron and
low-carbon steel. However, they are also observed in many metals including other body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed metals. In many cases thephenomena are not as pronounced as they are in steel.
9.14 THE COTTRELL-BILBY THEORY OF STRAIN AGING
One of the earlier successes in the area of dislocation theory was the Cottrell-Bilby theoryof strain aging.
3Actually, this theory does not directly concern the rise in the ﬂow-stress
due to aging a strained metal. Rather, it deals with the time- and temperature-dependentgrowth of solute atmospheres near dislocations. Speciﬁcally, they addressed the case ofan edge dislocation in bcc iron containing carbon atoms in solid solution. As indicated inSec. 9.9, the interaction energy between a solute carbon atom and an edge dislocation canbe computed with the aid of Eq. 9.20 or
9.25
where Uis the interaction energy, Athe interaction constant, Rthe distance from the
dislocation line to the interstitial atom, and uthe angle between Rand the slip plane to the
right of the dislocation, as indicated in Fig. 9.5. For ﬁxed values of U, Eq. 9.25 yields a set
of circles passing through the dislocation line. A number of these equipotential lines areshown in Fig. 9.10. Note that the equipotential lines corresponding to positive values of U
lie above the slip plane while those for negative Uvalues lie below the slip plane. The
largest positive or negative values of Ucorrespond to the smallest circles.
From the above it is evident that there is a variation of the interaction energy from
one circle to the next in Fig. 9.10. The carbon atoms experience a force, F, due to this
energy gradient. A result of this force is that the carbon atoms may attain a drift velocitythat can be computed with the aid of the Einstein equation

coefﬁcient gives a measure of the atomic mobility of the solute atoms due to the fact thatU/H11005A/H11080sin( u)

thermal vibrations can cause them to jump back and forth between adjacent interstitial sites.
These jumps become more frequent as the temperature increases. In the absence of an
energy gradient, the jumps tend to occur in a statistically random fashion, with the result
that the solute concentration remains statistically homogeneous. In other words, the jumps
in any one direction tend to be balanced by an equal number of jumps in the opposite direc-
tion. However, in the presence of an energy gradient, such as that in the stress ﬁeld of an
edge dislocation, the jumps tend to occur more frequently in the direction of decreasing
interaction energy than in the opposite direction. The result is a net ﬂow of solute down the
energy gradient. The Einstein equation is able to give a quantitative measure of this directed
ﬂow of solute atoms down the energy gradient. If one considers the dimensions of the
components of Eq. 9.26, those of Dare m2/H20862s, that of 1 /H20862kTis 1/H20862J, while those of Fare J /H20862m.
Thus vhas the dimensions m/s or those of a velocity. The maximum energy gradient occurs
in a direction normal to the equipotential lines in Fig. 9.10 and thus falls along a circular
dashed line like that shown in the ﬁgure. The dashed circular line in Fig. 9.10 is thus a
possible path for the movement of a carbon atom. Cottrell and Bilby3estimated that the
mean gradient of the energy, U, around one of these circles of radius ris of the order of
dU/H20862dr/H11005F/H11005A/H20862r29.27
where dU/H20862dris the average energy gradient, Fthe average force, Athe interaction
constant, and rthe radius of the circular path along which the solute atom moves. Thus,
the mean velocity of an atom along its path is about

The time to move completely around a path of radius rat this velocity is
9.29
Let trepresent the time for a solute atom to move completely around a path of radius r1.
A reasonable assumption is that, in this time interval, all solute atoms lying within the
circle of radius r1should have moved up to the region underneath the dislocation.
However, all of the circular flow lines with radii greater than r1should still be active
and continue to supply carbon atoms to the region below the dislocation line. In asmall time increment, dt, each of these latter flow lines will add to the dislocations a
number of solute atoms from a length increment measured from its end point equalto [( AD/H20862kT)/H20862r
2] dt. The total accumulation of this solute in the time increment dt
should thus be
2dt(AD/H20862kT/H20862r2) dt 9.30
Note that the above equation is multiplied by 2 in order to take into account the fact thatfor every ﬂow line to the right of the dislocation there is an equivalent one on the left ofthe dislocation. In order to account for all active ﬂow lines, the above integration shouldbe carried out between the limits r/H11005(ADt /H20862kT)
1/3and r/H11005/H11009. The ﬁrst of these limits is
obtained by solving Eq. 9.27 for r. If Eq. 9.30 is integrated between these limits there
is obtained 2( AD/H20862kT)2/3(dt/H20862t1/3). This represents the area that has supplied solute to the
dislocation between tand t/H11001dt.
Cottrell and Bilby next computed the number of solute atoms supplied to the disloca-
tion from the depleted area. They deduced that it should equal the number that the areawould have contained before the aging process started, assuming that the solute wasuniformly distributed. On this basis, they observed that the number of solute atoms whichwould arrive in a given time tis

If one desires to know the fraction of solute, f, that has segregated to the dislo-
cations in the time t, it may be computed by dividing n(t)/H11080rby nowhere n(t)is the
number of segregated solute atoms on a unit length of dislocation, rthe total length

with carbon in solid solution were usedthat the rate of arrival of solute atoms at the dislocation should vary as t2/3. This
prediction has been generally veriﬁed by experiment for short aging times. When the

At the present time it is generally felt that the Harper equation should be given the sta-
tus of an empirical equation even though it was derived by Harper on theoretical grounds,
because the basic assumption used in his derivation has been questioned. In any event, the
Harper equation is often able to describe very well the dependence on time of the solute ﬂow
that leads to atmospheres at dislocations. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 9.11, which
shows Harper’s original results. Note that in this ﬁgure log10(1/H11002f) plots linearly against t2/3
for data obtained at six different temperatures between 294.5 and 324.5 K. These data were

ing was used in order to create a number of new dislocations in the iron. An internal fric-
tion method was then used to measure the concentration of carbon remaining in solid
solution in the iron wires as they were allowed to age. The assumption was made that the
carbon which had accumulated at the dislocations up to a given time, t, had been removed
from the solid solution. On this basis, the concentration of carbon still in solid solution
should equal (1 /H11002f).
It should be noted that the Cottrell-Bilby and Harper equations (Eqs. 9.32 and 9.33) are
only concerned with the ﬂow of the solute to dislocations. That is, they do not measure
directly the change in the ﬂow-stress resulting from the accumulation of solute at the dis-
locations. In order to do this, one must assume that the relative change in the ﬂow-stress
/H9004d//H9004dmis equal to f, where dsis the incremental increase in the ﬂow-stress and 
dsmis the maximum possible increase. This assumption has often proved to yield credible09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:37 PM  Page 280

9.15 DYNAMIC STRAIN AGING
As indicated previously, the higher the temperature the faster the yield point reappears. At
a sufﬁciently high temperature, the interaction between the impurity atoms and the dis-
locations should occur during deformation. When aging occurs during deformation, the
phenomenon has been called dynamic strain aging . There are many physical manifestations
of dynamic strain aging, some of which will now be described.
First, it is important to note that dynamic strain aging tends to occur over a wide tem-
perature range and that the temperature interval in which it is observed depends on the
strain rate. Increasing the strain rate raises both the upper and lower temperature limits
associated with the dynamic strain aging phenomena. Thus, in steel deformed at a normal
cross-head speed of 8.4 mm/s (0.02 in. per min.), dynamic strain aging effects are observed
between approximately 370 K and 620 K. However, at a strain rate 106faster, these same
limits occur at about 720 and 970 K.
An interesting aspect of dynamic strain aging is that when it occurs the yield stress
(or the critical resolved shear stress) of a metal tends to become independent of temper-
ature. This is shown in Fig. 9.14, where the 0.2 percent yield stress of titanium is plotted
as a function of temperature. Note that from slightly above 600 K to about 800 K the
yield stress is almost constant. At the same time, the ﬂow-stress becomes almost inde-
pendent of strain rate. In many metals the ﬂow-stress can be related to the strain rate by
a simple power law

where Ais a constant and the exponent nis called the strain rate sensitivity . This equation
can also be written in the form
9.35
and taking the logarithms of both sides we have
9.36
In most modern testing machines very rapid changes in the applied strain rate may
be made during a tensile test. If this is done and the corresponding values of strain rate
and ﬂow-stress (measured just before and after the rate change) are substituted into this
equation, one is able to determine a value of n. When measurements of this type,
corresponding to a change in strain rate between two rates differing by a simple ratio,
are made on a metal that is not subject to dynamic strain aging, the value of ntends to
rise linearly with the absolute temperature. However, when dynamic strain aging is
observed, the value of nbecomes very low in the temperature range of strain aging,
because, in this interval, the ﬂow-stress becomes nearly independent of the strain rate.
This is illustrated for the case of an aluminum alloy in Fig. 9.15.
Inside the dynamic strain aging temperature range the plastic ﬂow often tends to become
unstable. This is manifested by irregularities in the stress-strain diagram. These discontinuities
may be of several types. In some cases the load tends to rise abruptly and then fall. In others
the plastic ﬂow is best described as jerky. However, actual sharp load drops are often observed,
as indicated schematically in Fig. 9.16. These serrations, as they appeared in aluminum alloys,
were ﬁrst studied in detail by Portevin and LeChatelier,12and it is now common to call the
phenomenon associated with these serrations the Portevin-LeChatelier effect .
One of the most signiﬁcant aspects of dynamic strain aging, observed primarily in
metals containing interstitial solutes, is that the work hardening rate can becomen/H11005loges2

PROBLEMS
9.1At room temperature the stable crystal structure of iron
is bcc. However, above 1183 K it becomes fcc. The iron fcc
crystal structure is able to dissolve a much larger concentra-tion of carbon than is the bcc structure. A primary reasonfor this is believed to be that while the fcc structure is moreclose packed, the octahedral interstitial sites in this latticeare much larger than the sites occupied by the carbonatoms in the bcc structure. The hole at the center of the fccunit cell is such a site. See Fig. 1.6A. The minimum open-ing in one of these sites corresponds to the distancebetween atoms along a /H20855100 /H20856direction. Note that this is the
same as in the bcc case. Compare the fcc opening with thatof the bcc lattice. For the sake of convenience assume thefcc iron atom diameter is the same as that of the bcc atomat room temperature.

carbon is supplied by graphite particles in the iron. Thisequation is

where Ccgis the carbon concentration in weight per percent
in equilibrium with the graphite, Ris the gas constant
in J/mol-K, and Tis the absolute temperature. Write a
computer program for this equation and use it to obtain theweight percent of the carbon as a function of the tempera-ture between 300 and 1000 K at 50°. Plot the data to obtaina curve and compare the curve with that in Fig. 9.3.9.3An approximate equation giving the atom fraction of
carbon soluble in Austenite, or the fcc cubic form of iron,when the carbon comes from Fe
3C, is

where Qis in J/mol, Rin J/mol- K, and Tin degrees K. Write
a program that ﬁrst gives the atom fraction of carbon at agiven temperature and then converts the answer to weightpercent carbon. With the aid of this program determine theatom fraction and weight percent carbon in Austenite at1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, and 1421 K, respectively.

(see Eqs. 4.10 and 9.17) may be written in the form

sions for the stress components of an edge dislocation,given earlier, derive Eq. 9.19.

10 times faster. This illustration suggests that, at the temperature in question, there isa maximum work hardening rate corresponding to a speciﬁc strain rate. A similar max-imum work hardening rate will be observed if the temperature is raised or lowered,provided that the strain rate is adjusted accordingly. Thus, if the temperature is raised,the strain rate at which maximum work hardening is observed also rises.
Finally, one of the other well-known manifestations of dynamic strain aging is the
phenomenon called blue brittleness when it occurs in steel. In approximately the cen-
ter of the temperature range where the other phenomena of dynamic strain aging areobserved, it has been found that the elongation, as measured in a tensile test, becomesvery small or passes through a minimum on a curve of elongation plotted against thetemperature. This subject is considered in Section 23.13 with regard to how it differsfrom the intermediate temperature creep embrittlement phenomenon.
The various dynamic strain aging phenomena do not appear to the same degree in all
metals. However, they are commonly observed and it is probably safe to state that, ingeneral, dynamic strain aging is the rule rather than the exception in metals.09Ch09.qxd  11/6/08  3:37 PM  Page 285

10.1 BASIC DEFINITIONS
The concept of phases is very important in the ﬁeld of metallurgy. A phase is deﬁned
as a macroscopically homogeneous body of matter . This is the precise thermodynamic mean-
ing of the word. However, this term is often used more loosely in speaking of a solid orother solution which can have a composition that varies with position and still be des-ignated as a phase. For the present this fact will be ignored and the basic deﬁnition willbe considered to hold. Let us consider a simple system: a single metallic element, forexample, copper, a so-called one-component system. Solid copper conforms to the def-inition of a phase, and the same is true when it is in the liquid and gaseous forms.However, solid, liquid, and gas have quite different characteristics, and at the freezingpoint (or at the boiling point) where liquid and solid (or liquid and gas) can coexistrespectively, two homogeneous types of matter are present rather than one. It can beconcluded that each of the three forms of copper—solid, liquid, and gas—constitutes aseparate and distinct phase.
Certain metals, for example, iron and tin, are polymorphic (allotropic) and crys-
tallize in several structures, each stable in a different temperature range. Here eachcrystal structure defines a separate phase, so that polymorphic metals can exist inmore than one solid phase. As an example, consider the phases of iron, as given inTable 10.1. Notice that there are three separate solid phases for iron, each denoted byone of the Greek symbols: alpha (
/H9251), gamma ( /H9253), or delta ( /H9254). Actually, there are only
two different solid iron phases since the alpha and delta phases are identical; both arebody-centered cubic.
At one time, iron was believed to possess a third solid phase, the beta (
/H9252) phase,
because heating and cooling curves indicated a phase transformation in the temperaturerange from 773 to 1064 K. It has since been demonstrated that in this temperaturerange iron changes from the ferromagnetic to the paramagnetic form on heating.Since the crystal structure remains body-centered cubic throughout the region of themagnetic transformation, the 
/H9252phase is no longer generally recognized as a separate
phase. In other words, the magnetic transformation is now considered to occurinside the alpha phase.
Let us now consider alloys instead of pure metals. Binary alloys , two-component
systems, are mixtures of two metallic elements, while ternary alloys are three-component
systems: mixtures of three metallic elements. At this time, two terms that havebeen used a number of times should be clearly deﬁned: the words system and component .
A system , as used in the sense usually employed in thermodynamics, or physical
chemistry, is an isolated body of matter. The components of a system are oftenthe metallic elements that make up the system. Pure copper or pure nickel are bythemselves one-component systems, while alloys formed by mixing these two elements

are two-component systems. Metallic elements are not the only types of components
that can be used to form metallurgical systems; it is possible to have systems withcomponents that are pure chemical compounds. The latter type is perhaps of moreinterest to the physical chemist, but it is also of importance in the ﬁeld of metallurgy andceramics. A typical two-component system, with components that are chemicalcompounds, is formed by mixing common salt, NaCl, and water, H
2O. Another impor-
tant compound that is usually considered as a component occurs in steels. Steels arenormally considered to be two-component systems consisting of iron (an element) andiron carbide (Fe
3C), a compound.
When alloys are formed by mixing selected component metals, the gaseous state,
generally speaking, is of little practical interest. In any case, there is only a single phasein the gaseous state, for all gases mix to form uniform solutions. In the liquid state, itsometimes happens, as in alloys formed by adding lead to iron, that the liquid compo-nents are not miscible, and then it is possible to have several liquid phases. However,in most alloys of commercial interest, the liquid components dissolve in each other toform a single liquid solution. In the discussion of phases and phase diagrams thatfollows, our attention will be concentrated on alloys in which the liquid componentsare miscible in all proportions.
The nature of the solid phases that occur in alloys will now be considered. Certain
metals, for example, the lead-iron combination mentioned above, do not dissolveappreciably in each other in either the liquid or the solid state. Since this is the case,there are two solid phases, each of which is extremely close to being a pure metal(a component). The solid phases in most alloy systems, however, are usually solidsolutions of either of two basic types. First, there are the terminal solid solutions (phases
based on the crystal structures of the components). Thus, in binary alloys of copperand silver, there is a terminal solid solution in which copper acts as the solvent, withsilver the solute, and another in which silver is the solvent and copper the solute.Second, in some binary alloys, crystal structures different from those of either compo-nent may form at certain ratios of the two components. These are called intermediate
phases . Many of them are solid solutions in every sense of the word, for they do not
have a fixed composition (ratio of the components) and appear over a range ofcompositions. A well known intermediate solid solution is the so-called 
/H9252phase in
brass (copper-zinc) which is stable at room temperature in the range 47 percent Znand 53 percent Cu to 50 percent Zn and 50 percent Cu, all measured in weightpercentages. This intermediate phase is not the only one that appears in copper-zincTABLE 10.1 Phases of Pure Iron.

alloys. There are three other intermediate solid solutions, making in all six copper-zinc
solid phases: the four intermediate phases and the two terminal phases.
In some alloys intermediate crystal structures are formed that are best identiﬁed as
compounds. One intermetallic compound has already been discussed, namely, iron-carbide, Fe
3C.
10.2 THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF PHASE MIXTURES
A brief explanation of the physical signiﬁcance of “a system of several phases” is inorder. To illustrate, consider a simple mixture of two phases. In general, these phaseswill not be separated into two distinct and separate regions, such as oil ﬂoating on water.Rather, the usual metallurgical two-phase system is comparable to an emulsion of oildroplets in a matrix of water. In speaking of such systems, it is common to refer to thephase (water) that surrounds the other phase as the continuous or matrix phase , and the
phase (oil) that is surrounded, the discontinuous or dispersed phase . It should be noticed,
however, that the structure of a two-phase system may be so interconnected that bothphases are continuous. An example was cited in Chapter 6, where it was mentionedthat, under the proper conditions, a second phase, present in a limited amount, mightbe able to run through the structure as a continuous network along grain edges. Thefactors controlling this type of structure are described in Chapter 6.
In the solid state, a metallurgical system of several phases is a mixture of several
different types of crystals. If the crystal sizes are small, surface energy effects becomeimportant and should rightfully be included in thermodynamic or energy calculation. Inthe following presentation, for the sake of simplicity, the surface energy will be neglected.It will also be assumed that all systems are removed from electric- and magnetic-ﬁeldgradients so that their effects on our systems can also be ignored.
10.3 THERMODYNAMICS OF SOLUTIONS
It can be concluded that the phases in alloy systems are usually solutions—either liquid,solid, or gaseous. it is true that solid phases do sometimes form, with composition rangesso narrow that they are considered as compounds, but it is also possible to think of themas solutions of very limited solubility. In the discussion immediately following, the latterviewpoint is taken and all alloy phases are spoken of as solutions.
In general, the free energy of a solution is a thermodynamic property of the
solution, or a variable that depends on the thermodynamic state of the solution (thatis, system). More detailed discussion and analysis of thermodynamic properties can befound in thermodynamic textbooks.
1–5In a one-component system (a pure substance)
in a given phase, the thermodynamic state is determined uniquely if any two of itsthermodynamic properties (variables) are known. Among the variables that areclassed as properties are the temperature ( T), the pressure ( P), the volume ( V), the
enthalpy ( H), the entropy ( S), and the free energy ( G). Thus, in a one-component sys-
tem of a given mass and phase, if the two variables temperature and pressure are spec-ified, the volume of the system will have a definite fixed value. At the same time, itsfree energy, enthalpy, and other properties will also have values that are fixed anddeterminable.10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 289
Chapter 10 Phases 290
Solutions have additional degrees of freedom compared with pure substances,
and it is necessary to specify values for more than just two properties to define
the state of a solution. In general, temperature and pressure are employed as two ofthe required variables, while the composition of the solution furnishes the remain-der. The number of independent composition variables is, of course, one less than thenumber of components. This can be seen if the composition is expressed in atom ormole fractions. In a three-component system, for example, the mole fractions aregiven by
10.1
where N
A, NB, and NCare the mole fractions, and nA, nB, and nCare the actual number of
moles of the A, B, and Ccomponents, respectively. By deﬁnition of the mole fraction, we
have the condition
NA/H11001NB/H11001NC/H110051 10.2
From this expression the value of any one of the mole fractions can be computedonce the other two are known. There are only two independent mole fractions in aternary system.
Most metallurgical processes occur at constant temperature and pressure, and,
under these conditions, the state of a solution can be considered to be a function of itscomposition. Similarly, any of the state functions (properties), such as free energy ( G),
can be considered a function of only the composition variables. In the case of a three-component system, the total free energy ( G) of a solution is written:
G/H11005G(nA, nB, nC) (temperature and pressure constant) 10.3
where nA, nB, and nCare the number of moles, respectively, of the A, B, and Ccomponents.
By partial differentiation, the differential of the free energy of a single solution of three
components at constant pressure and temperature is
10.4
where the partial derivatives, such as /H11128G//H11128nA, represent the change in the free energy
when only one of the components is varied by an inﬁnitesimal amount. Thus, for a verysmall variation of component A, while the amounts of the components Band Cin the
solution are maintained constant, we have
10.5
In the present case, the partial derivatives are the partial molal free energies of thesolution and are designated by the symbols 
A, B, and C, so that Eq. 10.5 can also
be written

291 10.3 Thermodynamics of Solutions
The total free energy of a solution composed of nAmoles of component A, nBmoles
of component B, and nCmoles of component Ccan be obtained by integrating Eq. 10.6.1
This integration can be made quite easily in the following manner.
Let us start with zero quantity of the solution and form it by simultaneously adding
inﬁnitesimal quantities of the three components dnA, dnB, and dnC. Each time that we add
the inﬁnitesimals, however, let us make the amounts of the components in the inﬁnitesimals
have the same ratio as the ﬁnal numbers of moles of the components nA, nB, and nC, so that
10.7
If the solution is formed in this manner, its composition at any instant will be the same asits ﬁnal composition. In other words, the composition will be constant at all times, andsince the partial-molal free energies are functions of only the composition of the solution(at constant temperature and pressure), they will also be constant during the formation ofthe solution. Integration of
dG/H11005AdnA/H11001BdnB/H11001CdnC
starting from zero quantity of solution, with the condition that A, B, and Care constant,
gives us
G/H11005nAA/H11001nBB/H11001nCC10.8
where nA, nB, and nCare the number of moles of the three components in the solution.
Let us differentiate Eq. 10.8 completely to obtain
dG/H11005nAdA/H11001AdnA/H11001nBdB/H11001BdnB/H11001nCdC/H11001CdnC
But we have already seen that the derivative of the free energy is
dG/H11005AdnA/H11001BdnB/H11001CdnC
and the only way that both of these expressions for the derivative of the total free energycan be true is for
nAdA/H11001nBdB/H11001nCC/H110050 10.9
This equation gives a relationship between the number of moles of each component in athree-component solution and the derivatives of the partial-molal free energies. Similarrelationships can be deduced for a two-component solution and for a solution of morethan three components. Thus, for two components,
nAdA/H11001nBdB/H110050
and for four components

10.4 EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN TWO PHASES
A binary (two-component) system with two phases in equilibrium will now be considered.
The total free energy for the ﬁrst phase, which we shall designate as the alpha ( /H9251) phase, is
G/H9251/H11005n/H9251
A/H9251
A/H11001n/H9251

while that of the beta ( /H9252) phase is

A/H9252
A/H11001n/H9252
B/H9252
B10.10
Let a small quantity ( dnA) of component Abe transferred from the alpha phase
to the beta phase. As a result of this transfer, the free energy of the alphaphase will be decreased, while that of the beta phase will be increased. The totalfree-energy change of the system is the sum of these two changes and can be repre-sented by
dG/H11005dG/H9251/H11001dG/H9252/H11005/H9251

or
dG/H11005(/H9252
A/H11002/H9251
A) dnA10.11
But we have assumed that the two given phases are at equilibrium. This signifies thatthe state of the two-phase system is at a minimum with respect to its free energy (totalfree energy of the two solutions). The variation in the free energy for any infinitesi-mal change inside the system, such as the shift of a small amount of component A
from one phase to the other, must, accordingly, be zero. Therefore,
dG/H11005(/H9252
A/H11002/H9251

Since dnAis not zero, we are able to deduce the following important conclusion:

and in the same manner it can be shown that

The above quite general results are not restricted to systems of only two components
or systems containing only two phases. In fact, it may be shown that, in the general casewhere there are Mcomponents with 
/H9262phases in equilibrium, the partial molal free energy
of any given component is the same in all phases, or

Further, since the partial molal free energy of any component is the same in all phases, weneed no longer use the phase superscripts when specifying partial molal free erergies of thecomponents.
10.5 THE NUMBER OF PHASES IN AN ALLOY SYSTEM
One-Component Systems For a complete understanding of alloy systems,
it is necessary to know the conditions determining the number of phases in a systemat equilibrium. In a one-component system the conditions are well known. A glanceat Table 10.1 shows that in the single-component system (pure iron) under theconditions of constant pressure, two phases can coexist only at those temperatureshaving a phase change: the boiling point, the melting point, and the temperatures atwhich solid-state phase changes occur. At all other temperatures only a single phaseis stable.
Let us now consider the causes for phase changes in a one-component system.
In particular, let us consider a solid-state phase change; the interesting allotropictransformation of white tin to gray tin. The former, or beta (
/H9252) phase has a body-
centered tetragonal crystal structure that can be thought of as a body-centered cubicstructure with one elongated axis. This is the ordinary, or commercial, form of tinand possesses a true metallic luster. The other, or alpha (
/H9251) phase, that is gray in
color, is the equilibrium phase at temperatures below 286.2 K. Fortunately, fromboth a practical and a scientific point of view, the transformation from white to graytin is very slow at all temperatures below 286.2 K. With regard to the practical aspect,it is fortunate that tin does not turn instantly to gray tin once the temperature fallsbelow the equilibrium temperature, because objects made of tin are usually ruinedwhen the change occurs. Gray tin has a diamond cubic-crystal structure, a basicallybrittle structure, and this fact, coupled with the large volume expansion (about27 percent) that accompanies the transformation, can cause the metal to disintegrateinto a powder. On the other hand, the fact that the change occurs very slowlymakes it possible to study the properties of a single element in two crystalline formsover a very wide range of temperatures. In this respect, the specific heat at constantpressure of both the gray and the white forms of tin have been measured fromambient temperatures down to almost absolute zero. A plot of these data is shown inFig. 10.1. The importance of this information lies in the fact that with it, it is possi-ble to compute the free energy of both solid phases as a function of temperature. Letus see how this is done.
By deﬁnition, the Gibbs free energy of a pure substance is
G/H11005H/H11002TS 10.14
where G/H11005the free energy in Joules per mole
T/H11005the temperature in degrees Kelvin
H/H11005the enthalpy (Joules per mole)
S/H11005the entropy in Joules per mole degree Kelvin
To evaluate the free energy of the substance at some temperature T, one needs to
know both the enthalpy Hand the entropy S. Both of these quantities can be found in10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 293

FIG. 10.2 Temperature-free energy curves
for two solid forms of tinThe term S0, which is the entropy at absolute zero, may be equated to zero, for at this
temperature, assuming perfect crystallinity (a pure substance with no entropy of mixing)
and lattice vibrations in their ground levels, there is no disorder of any kind. (This is
actually a statement of the third law of thermodynamics, which says that the entropy of a
pure crystalline substance is zero at the absolute zero of temperature.)
With the aid of the equations stated in the preceding paragraph, we can now express
the free energy of both the alpha and beta phases of tin as functions of the temperature
and the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure.
10.18
These equations can be evaluated by means of graphical calculus, using the curves of
Fig. 10.1. The results are shown in Fig. 10.2, where the free energies of the two phases
are equal at the temperature 286.2 K. At temperatures below this value, gray tin has the
lowest free energy, while for temperatures above it, white tin has the lowest free energy.
Since the phase with the lowest free energy is always the most stable one, we see that
gray tin is the preferred phase below 286.2 K, while white tin is the more stable at tem-
peratures higher than this.
An interesting feature to notice in Fig. 10.2 is that the free energy of both phases
decreases with increasing temperature. This is a general property of free-energy curves,
which demonstrates the importance of the TSterm in the free-energy equation. Figure 10.3
shows another method of interpreting the information given in Fig. 10.2. The curve marked

At the temperature of transformation (286.2 K), /H9004Hand T/H9004Sare equal, so that /H9004Gis zero.
The above allotropic transformation can also be interpreted in the following manner.
At low temperatures, the phase with the smaller enthalpy is the stable phase where, by
deﬁnition, the enthalpy is
H/H11005U/H11001PV 10.20
where Uis the internal energy, Pthe pressure, and Vthe volume. In solids, the PVterm is
usually very small compared with the internal energy. Thus, the stable phase at lower
temperatures is that with the lower internal energy or with the tighter binding of the
atoms. On the other hand, at high temperatures the T/H9004Sbecomes more important, and
the phase with the greater entropy becomes the preferred phase. Generally, this is a phase
with a looser form of binding or with greater freedom of atom movement. In tin, it appears
that, although the diamond cubic lattice (alpha phase) has the lower density, the binding
forces between atoms in this structure are of such a nature that the atoms are more
restrained in their vibratory motion than they are in the tetragonal, or beta, lattice.T/H9004S/H11005T/H20885T

FIG. 10.4 Free energies of bcc, fcc, and liquid iron versus
temperatureIn many cases, the structure of closest packing represents the more closely bound
phase, and a more open structure the one with the greatest entropy of vibration. In this
classiﬁcation, where the high-temperature stable phase is body-centered cubic and
the low-temperature phase a close-packed structure, such as face-centered cubic or
close-packed hexagonal, the elements are Li, Na, Ca, Sr, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Tl.
The element iron presents an unusual example of allotropic-phase changes, in that the
stable phase at low temperatures is body-centered cubic that transforms to face-centered
cubic at 1183 K. On further heating, a second solid-state transformation to body-centered
cubic occurs at 1673 K. The solid ﬁnally melts at 1812 K. The free energies of these phases
versus temperature are shown in Fig 10.4.
An explanation of these allotropic reactions that occur in iron has been given by Zener
and can be interpreted in the following broad general terms. The two competing solid
phases of iron are face-centered cubic (gamma phase) and body-centered cubic (alpha
phase). However, the alpha phase has two basic modiﬁcations: ferromagnetic and para-
magnetic. The ferromagnetic form of the body-centered cubic phase is stable at low
temperatures, while the paramagnetic form is stable at high temperatures. The change
from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism takes place by what is known as a second-order
transformation , occurring over a range of temperatures extending from about 773 K to
several hundred degrees above this temperature. It would, thus, appear that at low
temperatures, the competing, phases in iron are actually ferromagnetic alpha and gamma,
where the phase of the lowest internal energy and entropy is the former. The alpha phase
is, accordingly, the stable phase at low temperatures, but gives way to the gamma phase
with increasing temperatures as the entropy term of the difference in free energy between
the phases becomes dominant. This transformation takes place at 1183 K.
At about the same time that the gamma phase becomes the more stable form,
the alpha phase loses its ferromagnetism, therefore, for further increases in tempera-
ture the competing phases are gamma and paramagnetic alpha. In the paramagnetic10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 297
Chapter 10 Phases 298
form, the alpha phase has a greater internal energy and entropy than it does in the
ferromagnetic form. This effect is large enough to reverse the relative positions ofthe alpha phase and the gamma phase. The gamma phase now becomes the onewith the lowest internal energy and entropy and gives way to the alpha phase whenthe temperature exceeds 1673 K.
Two-Component Systems The study of systems of more than one component
involves a study of solutions. The simplest type of multicomponent system is a binary one,and the least complex structure in such a system is a single solution. Some of the aspectsof single-phase binary systems will now be considered.
Ideal Solutions Assume that a solution is formed between atoms of two
kinds, Aand B, and that any given atom of either Aor Bexhibits no preference as to
whether its neighbors are of the same kind or of the opposite kind. In this case, therewill be no tendency for either Aatoms or for Batoms to cluster together or for oppo-
site types of atoms to attract each other. Such a solution is said to be an ideal solution ,
and its free energy per mole is expressed as the sum of the free energy of N
Amoles
of Aatoms, plus NBmoles of Batoms, less a decrease in free energy due to the
entropy associated with mixing Aatoms and Batoms, where NAand NBare the mole,
or atom, fractions of Aand B, respectively.

/H9004B/H11005B/H11002G0

The quantities /H9004Aand /H9004Brepresent the increase in free energy when one mole of A,
or one mole of B, is dissolved at constant temperature in a very large quantity of the
solution. These free-energy changes are functions of the composition, and it is necessary
to deﬁne them in terms of the addition of a quantity of pure Aor pure Bto a very large
volume of the solution in order that the composition of the solution remains unchanged.
Nonideal Solutions In general, most liquid and solid solutions are not ideal
and, in solid solutions, it is not to be expected that two atomic forms, chosen at random,will show no preference either for their own or for their opposites. If either of these eventsoccurs, then a larger or smaller free-energy change ( /H9004
A, /H9004B) will be observed than that
expected in an ideal solution. For a nonideal solution, the change in molal free energy isnot given by Eq. 10.26:
/H9004A/H11005RTln NA
which holds for an ideal solution. However, in order to retain the form of this simplerelationship, we deﬁne a quantity “ a,” known as the activity, in such a fashion that for
a nonideal solution
/H9004A/H11005RTln aA10.27
/H9004B/H11005RTln aB
where aAis the activity of component A, and aBthe activity of component B. The activities
of the components of a solution are useful indicators of the extent to which a solutiondeparts from an ideal solution. They are functions of the composition of the solution, andFig. 10.5 shows typical activity curves for two types of alloy systems. In both Figs. 10.5Aand 10.5B the straight lines marked N
Aand NBcorrespond to the atom fractions of the
components Aand B, respectively. Figure 10.5A shows an alloy system in which activities

composition, as indicated by the dotted vertical line marked x. The signiﬁcance of this
positive deviation will now be considered. Since both activities are greater than thecorresponding mole fractions, we need consider only one component, which we shallarbitrarily choose as B. According to the ﬁgure, N

formed. In situations such as this, the attraction between atoms of the same kind is
greater than the attraction between dissimilar atoms. The extreme example would be
one in which the two components were completely insoluble in each other, in which
case the activities would be equal to unity for all ratios of Aand B. The other set of
curves in Fig. 10.5B shows the opposite effect: unlike atoms are more strongly
attracted to each other than are those of the same kind. Here we find negative
deviations of the activity curves from the mole fraction lines.
It is apparent from the above that when the activities of the components of a solution
are compared to their respective atom fractions, they indicate roughly the nature of the
interactions of the atoms in the solution. For this reason, it is frequently convenient to
use quantities known as activity coefﬁcients , which are the ratios of the activities to their
respective atom fractions. The activity coefﬁcients of a binary solution of Aand Batoms
are thus deﬁned as

In the diffusion chapters (Chapters 12 and 13) it will be shown that when a composi-
tion gradient exists in a solid solution, diffusion usually occurs in such a way as to produce
a uniform composition in the solid solution. The thermodynamic reasons for this will now
be considered. Thus, if one has an ideal solution, then by Eqs. 10.25 the free energy of a
mole of the solution should be given by

considered to represent the free energy of one total mole of the two cornponents if
the components are not mixed, or do not mix. In the nonmiscible iron-lead system,
these two terms would be all that are required to specify the free energy of one total
mole of iron and lead. The other term, RT(NAln NA/H11001NBln NB), is the contribution
of the entropy of mixing to the free energy of the solution. Notice that this term isgA/H11005aA

FIG. 10.7 Hypothetical free energy of an ideal solutiondirectly proportional to the temperature and becomes increasingly important as the
temperature is increased.
To illustrate the dependence of the free energy of an ideal solution on its compo-
sition, let us consider the following assumed data. Free-energy curves for two
hypothetical pure elements Aand B, which are assumed to be completely soluble in
each other in the solid state, are shown in Fig. 10.6. Notice that in both curves the
free energy is shown to decrease with increasing temperature, in agreement with
the previously considered free-energy curves of the two solid phases of pure tin
(Fig. 10.2). At 481 K, the curves of Fig. 10.6 show that the free energy of the 
Acomponent ( G0
A) is 6280 J per mole, while that of the Bcomponent ( G0
B) is 8370 J
per mole. These two values are plotted in Fig. 10.7 at the right- and left-hand sides
of the figure, respectively. The dashed line connecting these points represents the

plotted in Fig. 10.7 as the dashed curve at the bottom of the figure. The free energy
of the solution proper is shown as the solid curve of Fig. 10.7 and is the sum of thetwo dashed curves.
At this point let us assume that we have a diffusion couple, one part of which
consists of half a mole of pure component A, and the other part of half a mole of pure
component B. The average composition of this pair of metals, when expressed in mole
fraction units, is NA/H11005NB/H110050.5, while its free energy at 500 K corresponds to point a
in Fig. 10.7 and is 7325 J/mol. The same quantity of Aand B, when mixed in the
form of a homogeneous solid solution, has the free energy of point bin Fig. 10.7 and
is 4457 J/mol. Clearly, mixing one-half mole of component Awith one-half mole of
component Breduces the free energy of the pair of metals by 2868 Joules, the value
of the contribution of the entropy of mixing to the free energy of the solution. Thissame 2868 J per mole is therefore the driving force that is capable of causing thecomponents of the couple to diffuse.
Now suppose that instead of two pure components, the above couple had consisted of
two homogeneous solid solutions: one solid solution with a composition NA/H110050.25 and
the other with the composition NA/H110050.75. At 500 K the free energy of the two portions
of this couple are shown in Fig. 10.7 as points cand d, respectively. If the average compo-
sition of the whole couple is again 0.5, the average free energy of the couple will lie atpoint e. A single homogeneous solid solution of the same average composition will have
the free energy of point b. Here again we see that the homogeneous solid solution has the
lower free energy and represents the stable state.
With arguments similar to the above, it is possible to show that any macroscopic
nonuniformity of composition in a solution phase represents a state of higher freeenergy than a homogeneous solution. If the temperature is sufﬁciently high that theatoms are able to move at an appreciable rate, diffusion will occur that has, as its endresult, a homogeneous solid solution. While the arguments used above were based onan average total composition N
A/H110050.5, any other total or average composition would
have given the same ﬁnal results.10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 302
303 10.6 Two-Component Systems Containing Two Phases
10.6 TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEMS CONTAINING TWO PHASES
Let us now take up the case of two-component systems that contain not a single phase,
but two phases. In either of the two phases, an equation of the form
nAdA/H11001nBdB/H110050 10.30
must be satisﬁed. Now, if each term is divided by the quantity nA/H11001nB, we can rewrite this
relationship in the form
NAdA/H11001NBdB/H110050 10.31
where nA/H20862(nA/H11001nB)/H11005NAand nB/H20862(nA/H11001nB)/H11005NB. If the phases are labeled alpha ( /H9251) and
beta ( /H9252), then in the respective phases we have
alpha phase:  N/H9251
AdA/H11001N/H9251
BdB/H110050
10.32
beta phase: N/H9252
AdA/H11001N/H9252
BdB/H110050
where the phase superscripts of the partial-molal free energies are omitted because,assuming equilibrium, the partial-molal free energy of either component is the same inboth phases.
This pair of equations restricts the values of the mole fractions of the components in the
solutions. These equations will be referred to as restrictive equations . In order to understand
how restrictive equations work, let us consider an example.
Imagine that an alloy of copper and silver is formed by melting together an equal
amount of each component. After the mixture has been formed, let it be frozen intothe solid state and then reheated and held at 1052 K long enough to attain equilib-rium. If, at the end of this heating period, the alloy is cooled very rapidly to roomtemperature, we can assume that the phases which were stable at the elevated tem-perature will be brought down to room temperature unchanged. Metallographicexamination of such an alloy will reveal a structure consisting of two solid-solutionphases, and a corresponding chemical analysis of the phases will show that thephases have the following compositions:G GG GG GG G
Alpha ( /H9251) Phase Beta ( /H9252) Phase
NAg/H110050.86 NAg/H110050.05
NCu/H110050.14 NCu/H110050.95
Substituting these values in the restrictive equations gives us
0.86 dAg/H110010.14 dCu/H110050
0.05 dAg/H110010.95 dCu/H110050

This impossible result suggests that the only way that the above equations can be true is
for both dAgand dCuto be zero, which means that at a constant temperature (1052 K)
and a constant pressure (one atmosphere), there can be no change in the partial-molal free
energies when the two phases are in equilibrium. Further, since the partial-molal
free energies are functions of only the composition of the phases, this, in turn, implies that
the compositions of the two phases must be constant. No matter what the relative
amounts of the two phases happen to be, as long as there is some of both phases
present, the composition in atomic percent of the alpha phase will be 86 percent Ag and
14 percent Cu, while that of the beta phase will be 5 percent Ag and 95 percent Cu.
10.7 GRAPHICAL DETERMINATIONS OF PARTIAL-MOLAL
FREE ENERGIES
A graphical method for determining the partial-molal free energies of a single binary
solution is shown in Fig. 10.8. This ﬁgure shows the same molal-free energy curve
previously given in Fig. 10.7. Suppose that one desires to determine the partial-molal freeG G0.86

energies of the two components of the solution when the composition has some arbitrary
value, perhaps NA/H110050.7. A vertical line through this composition intersect the free-
energy curve at point x, thereby determining the total free energy of the solution. Now if
a tangent is drawn to the free-energy curve at point x, the ordinate intercepts of this tan-
gent with the sides of the diagram (that is, at compositions NA/H110050 and NA/H110051) give the
partial-molal free energies. The intercept on the left is Band that on the right A. That
these relationships are true is easily shown by the geometry of the ﬁgure, which is repro-
duced for clarity in Fig. 10.8B. Thus, the free energy of the solution is
G/H11005B/H11001NA(A/H11002B)
or
G/H11005NAA/H11001(1/H11002NA)B
but
(1/H11002NA)/H11005NB
and therefore
G/H11005NAA/H11001NBB
which is the basic equation for the free energy of a binary solution.
The fact that at constant pressure and temperature the compositions of the phases
are ﬁxed in a binary two-phase mixture at equilibrium can also be shown with the aid
of free-energy diagrams of the phases plus the condition that the partial-molal free ener-
gies of each component be the same in both phases at equilibrium (that is, /H9251
A/H11005/H9252
Aand
/H9251
B/H11005/H9252
B). Figure 10.9 shows hypothetical free-energy curves for two phases of a binary
system at a temperature where the free-energy curves intersect. This intersection of the
curves is a condition for the existence of two phases at equilibrium. Certainly, if the free-
energy-versus-composition curve of one phase lies entirely below that of another phase,G GG GG GG GG G GG G

FIG. 10.10 Two phases in equilibrium
the lower one will always be the more stable and there can only be a single equilibrium
phase. It is also important to notice that the free-energy curves of the type shown in 
Fig 10.9 are functions of temperature. It is entirely possible for a pair of these curves to
intersect at one temperature, but at some higher or lower temperature to have no points
of intersection. In Chapter 11 more will be said on this subject when phase diagrams are
discussed.
Now assume that we have an alloy containing both phases in which the composition
of the alpha phase is N/H9251
A1and that of the beta phase is N/H9252
A1. Points aand bon the respective
free-energy curves give the free energies of the alpha and beta phases. The partial-molal
free energies of the two phases can be obtained by drawing tangents to points aand b. Their
interception with the sides of the ﬁgure determine the desired quantities. As may be seen
by examining Fig. 10.9, the arbitrarily chosen compositions of the two phases result in par-
tial-molal free energies of the components which are not the same in the two phases: /H9251
A/H11014/H9252
Aand /H9251
B/H11014/H9252
B. Actually the only way that two phases can have identical partial-molal free
energies is for both phases to have the same tangent. In other words, as shown in Fig. 10.10,
the composition of the two phases must have values corresponding to the intersection of a
common tangent with the two free-energy curves. Since only one common tangent can be
drawn to the curves of Fig. 10.10, the compositions of the alpha and beta phases must be
N/H9251
A2and N/H9252
A2.
10.8 TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEMS WITH THREE PHASES
IN EQUILIBRIUM
In two-component systems, three phases in equilibrium occur only under very restricted
conditions. The reason for this is not hard to see, for the partial-molal free energies of the
components must be the same in each of the three phases. In a graphical analysis like that
used in the two-phase example, this means that we must be able to draw a single straight
line that is tangent simultaneously with the free-energy curves of all three phases. Now
it is necessary to notice that each free-energy curve varies with temperature in a manner
different from that of the other phases and, in general, there will only be one tempera-
ture where it is possible to draw a single straight-line tangent to all three curves. It can
be seen, therefore, that three phases in a binary system can only be in equilibrium at oneG G GG10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 306

temperature. Furthermore, the compositions of the phases are ﬁxed by the points where
the common tangent touches the free-energy curves. We must conclude that in a binarysystem, when three phases are in equilibrium at constant pressure, the temperature andthe composition of each phase is ﬁxed.
At this point, it is well to recall the phase relations in single-component systems
where it was observed that, under the condition of constant pressure, two phases couldbe in equilibrium at only those ﬁxed temperatures at which phase changes occur. Ananalogous situation exists in two-component systems, for the temperatures at whichthree phases can be in equilibrium are also temperatures at which phase changes takeplace. Associated with each of these three-phase reactions is a deﬁnite composition of theentire alloy. At this composition, a single phase can be converted into another of twophases. In certain alloy systems, the single phase is the stable phase at temperaturesabove the transformation temperature, while two phases are stable below it. In othersystems the reverse is true.
As an example of a three-phase reaction, we may take the lead-tin alloy containing
61.9 percent Sn and 38.1 percent Pb (expressed in weight percent). This alloy forms asimple liquid solution at temperatures above 456 K, and at temperatures below 456 K it isstable in the form of a two-phase mixture. Each of the latter is a terminal solid solution, thecompositions of which are alpha phase 19.2 percent Sn and beta phase 97.5 percent Sn.A reaction of this type, when a single liquid phase is transformed into two solid phases, isknown as an eutectic reaction . The temperature at which the reaction takes place is the eutec-
tic temperature, and the composition which undergoes this reaction is the eutectic compo-sition (in the present example 61.9 percent Sn and 38.1 percent Pb).
The eutectic reaction is only one of several well-known three-phase transformations,
as can be seen by examining Table 10.3.
In the four transformation equations in Table 10.3, the reactions proceed to the right
when heat is removed from the system, and to the left when heat is added to the system.These reactions will be treated separately in Chapter 11.
10.9 THE PHASE RULE
We will now summarize most of the pertinent points of the preceding sections. For thispurpose, consider Fig. 10.11, a phase diagram of a one-component system where the vari-ables are the pressure and the temperature. A point such as that marked a, lying within
the limits of the gaseous phase, represents a gas whose state is determined by the temper-ature T
aand the pressure Pa. Changing either or both variables so as to bring the gas to
some other arbitrary state ( a/H11032) is entirely possible. As long as one stays within the limits of10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 307

FIG. 10.11 A single-component phase diagram
the region indicated as belonging to the gaseous phase, it is evident that there are two
degrees of freedom. That is, both the temperature and the pressure may be arbitrarily
varied. This statement also applies to the other two single-phase regions, liquid and solid.
In summary, when a single-component system exists as a single phase, there are two
degrees of freedom. This conclusion is stated in tabular form along the ﬁrst horizontal line
in Table 10.4.
Now consider the case where there are two phases in a single-component system. This
can only occur if the state of the system falls along one of the three lines in Fig. 10.11
separating the single-phase ﬁelds. For example, point brepresents a solid-vapor (gas)
mixture in equilibrium at temperature Tband pressure Pb. If now the temperature is changed
to T/H11032b, the pressure has to be changed to exactly P/H11032b. If this is not done, the two-phase system
becomes a single-phase system: either all solid or all gas. It can be concluded that there is
only one degree of freedom. This result is tabulated on the second line in Table 10.4.

309 10.10 Ternary Systems
The last possibility for the single-component system is illustrated by the third line in
Table 10.4 and corresponds to the case where three phases are in equilibrium in a single-
component system. This can only occur at the triple point designated by the symbol 0 inFig. 10.11. This three-phase equilibrium only occurs at one speciﬁc combination oftemperature and pressure and there are, accordingly, no degrees of freedom.
Table 10.4 next lists the various possibilities for a two-component system. Note that
for a single phase in a two-component system there are three degrees of freedom. Theseare normally considered to be the temperature, the pressure, and the composition of thephase. In the case of two phases in equilibrium in a binary system there are two degreesof freedom. This conforms to the conclusions of Sec. 10.6, where it was demonstrated thatat a chosen temperature and pressure where two phases could be maintained in equilib-rium, the compositions of the phases were automatically determined. Of course, it is pos-sible to vary the temperature and pressure, but such variations bring about determinablechanges in the composition of the phases.
Next, consider a binary system with three phases in equilibrium. Section 10.8 has
shown that here, if the pressure is ﬁxed, three-phase equilibrium can only occur at onetemperature. Varying the pressure naturally changes this temperature. However, thisresult implies that there is only one degree of freedom.
Finally, the case of four phases in a two-component system is equivalent to a triple
point in a single-component system. Four-phase equilibrium can only occur at a singlecombination of temperature and pressure, and the compositions of all phases are ﬁxed.There are, accordingly, no degrees of freedom.
This type of analysis could be extended to systems with larger numbers of components,
but it is simpler to invoke the use of the Gibbs phase rule, named after J. Willard Gibbs. Thisrelationship can be deduced from the data in Table 10.4. Note that if along any one of thehorizontal lines in the table one adds the number of phases P(given in column 2) to the
number of degrees of freedom F(given in column 3), the result is always the number of
components, C, plus a factor of 2. Thus we have
P/H11001F/H11005C/H110012
The phase rule is often of very great value in determining the factors involved in phaseequilibria.
10.10 TERNARY SYSTEMS
The phase structures of binary alloys are our primary concern here, but the phases in ter-nary alloys will also be considered. In general, ternary alloys are much more difﬁcult tounderstand than binary alloys and, as a result, one is usually forced into a study of binarysystems, in spite of the fact that many practical problems involve three or more components.
Analogous to the relations already considered for single- and two-component
systems, at certain fixed temperatures four-phase transformations may occur in whichthe compositions of the phases are fixed throughout the reactions. Furthermore, inevery case there are certain definite alloy compositions at which the entire alloyundergoes these phase transformations. In these reactions, either a single phase ischanged into three other phases, or two phases are changed into two different phases.A typical example of the former type of transformation is a ternary eutectic where asingle liquid solution changes into three solid solutions.10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 309

Ametal layer and that the atomic weights of metals Aand
Bare 80 and 60 grams per mole, respectively. Further
assume that the couple is held long enough at 500 Kso that, as a result of diffusion, a homogeneous solidsolution is obtained.
(a) What would be the free energy of the couple at the
beginning of the diffusion anneal? Give the answer in
Joules per mole.The preceding paragraph points out the similarity between four-phase systems in
ternary alloys and three-phase systems in binary alloys. In the same manner, three-phase
ternary systems are analogous to two-phase binary systems. Thus, at constant temperatureand pressure, a three-phase system in a ternary alloy will have ﬁxed compositions ofthe phases. This fact does not mean that the composition of the alloy as a whole has onevalue, but that the phases, which may be in any proportion, have ﬁxed compositions.
Three-component alloys may also have structures containing two phases or even a
single phase. It is important to notice that in a ternary alloy containing two phases, thecompositions of the phases are not ﬁxed. This statement is true of binary systems, but notof ternary systems.10Ch10.qxd  11/6/08  3:41 PM  Page 310

11.1 PHASE DIAGRAMS
Phase diagrams, also called equilibrium diagrams or constitution diagrams , are a very impor-
tant tool in the study of alloys. They deﬁne the regions of stability of the phases that can
occur in an alloy system under the condition of constant pressure (atmospheric). The coor-dinates of these diagrams are temperature (ordinate) and composition (abscissa). Noticethat the expression “alloy system” is used to mean all the possible alloys that can beformed from a given set of components. This use of the word system differs from the ther-
modynamic deﬁnition of a system, which refers to a single isolated body of matter. Analloy of one composition is representative of a thermodynamic system, while an alloy sys-tem signiﬁes all compositions considered together.
The interrelationships between the phases, the temperature, and the composition in
an alloy system are shown by phase diagrams only under equilibrium conditions. Thesediagrams do not apply directly to metals not at equilibrium. A metal quenched (cooledrapidly) from a higher temperature to a lower one (for example, room temperature) maypossess phases or metastable phase and compositions that are more characteristic of thehigher temperature than they are of the lower temperature. In time, as a result of ther-mally activated atomic motion, the quenched specimen may approach its equilibrium low-temperature state. If and when this occurs, the phase relationships in the specimen willconform to the equilibrium diagram. In other words, the phase diagram at any given tem-perature gives us the proper picture only if sufﬁcient time is allowed for the metal to cometo equilibrium.
In the sections that follow, unless speciﬁcally stated otherwise, it will always be
implied that equilibrium conditions hold. Further, because phase diagrams are of greatimportance in solving problems in practical metallurgy, we shall conform to commonusage and express all compositions in weight percent instead of atomic percent, as hasbeen the case heretofore.
11.2 ISOMORPHOUS ALLOY SYSTEMS
In the discussion that follows, only two-component, or binary, alloy systems will be con-sidered. The simplest of these systems is the isomorphous , in which only a single type of
crystal structure is observed for all ratios of the components. A typical isomorphous sys-tem is represented in the phase diagram of Fig. 11.1. The binary alloy series in question iscopper-nickel. These elements combine, as in all alloy systems of this type, to form only asingle liquid phase and a single solid phase. Since the gaseous phase is generally not con-sidered, there are only two phases involved in the entire diagram. Thus, the area in theﬁgure above the line marked “liquidus” corresponds to the region of stability of the liquidphase, and the area below the solidus line represents the stable region for the solid phase.Between the liquidus and solidus lines is a two-phase area where both phases can coexist.

313 11.2 Isomorphous Alloy Systems
The significance of several arbitrary points located on Fig. 11.1 will now be con-
sidered. A set of coordinates—a temperature and a composition—is associated with
each point. By dropping a vertical line from point xuntil it touches the axis of
abscissae, we find the composition 20 percent Cu. Similarly, a horizontal line
through the same point meets the ordinate axis at 500°C.* Point xsignifies an alloy
of 20 percent Cu and 80 percent Ni at a temperature of 500°C. The fact that the
given point lies in the region below the solidus line tells us that the equilibrium state
of this alloy is the solid phase. The structure implied is, therefore, one of solid-
solution crystals, and each crystal will have the same homogeneous composition
(20 percent Cu and 80 percent Ni). Under the microscope, such a structure will be
identical to a pure metal in appearance. In other respects, however, a metal of the
given composition will have different properties. It should be stronger and have a
higher resistivity than either pure metal, and it will also have a different surface
sheen or color.
Let us turn our attention to the point, y, which falls inside the two-phase region, the
area bounded by the liquidus and solidus lines. The indicated temperature in this case is
1200°C, while the composition is 70 percent Cu and 30 percent Ni. This 70 to 30 ratio ofWeight percent copper Temperature, °C

FIG. 11.2 The lever rulethe components represents the average composition of the alloy as a whole. It should be
remembered that we are now dealing with a mixture of phases (liquid plus solid) and that
neither possesses the average composition.
To determine the compositions of the liquid and the solid in the given phase mixture,
it is only necessary to extend a horizontal line (called a tie line ) through point yuntil it
intersects the liquidus and solidus lines. These intersections give the desired compositions.
In Fig. 11.1, the intersections are at points mand n, respectively. A vertical line dropped
from point mto the abscissa axis gives 62 percent Cu, which is the composition of the solid
phase. In the same manner, a vertical line dropped from point nshows that the composi-
tion of the liquid is 78 percent Cu.
11.3 THE LEVER RULE
A very important relationship, which applies to any two-phase region of a two-
component, or binary, phase diagram, is the so-called lever rule . With regard to the lever
rule, consider Fig. 11.2, which is an enlarged portion of the copper-nickel diagram of 
Fig. 11.1. Line mnis the same in the new ﬁgure as in the old and lies on the 1200°C
isothermal. One change has been made, however, and that is in the average alloy compo-
sition that is now assumed to be at point z, or at 73 percent Cu. Because this new compo-
sition still lies on the line mnand therefore in a two-phase region, it must also be a mixture
of liquid and solid at the given temperature. Further, since points mand nare identical in
both Figs. 11.1 and 11.2, it can be concluded that this new alloy must be composed of
phases whose compositions are the same as those in the previous example. The quantity
that does change, when the composition is shifted along line mnfrom point yto z, is the
relative amounts of liquid and solid. The compositions of the solid and the liquid are ﬁxed
as long as the temperature is constant. This conclusion is in perfect agreement with our
thermodynamic deductions in Chapter 10, where it was shown that at constant tempera-
ture and pressure the compositions of the phases in a two-phase mixture are ﬁxed.
While a composition shift of the alloy (taken as a whole) cannot alter the compo-
sitions of the phases in a two-phase mixture at constant temperature, it does change
the relative amounts of the phases. In order to understand how this occurs, we shall
determine the relative amount of liquid and of solid in an alloy of a given composi-
tion. For this purpose, take the alloy corresponding to point z, which has the average11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 314

Let wrepresent the weight of the solid phase of the alloy expressed in grams, and
(100 /H11002w) the weight of the liquid phase. The amount of copper in the solid form of the
alloy equals the weight of this phase times the percentage of copper ( Xs
Cu/H1100562 percent)
which it contains. Similarly, the weight of copper in the liquid phase is equal to the
weight of liquid times the percentage of copper in the liquid ( Xl
Cu/H1100578 percent). Thus
Weight of copper in the solid phase /H110050.62 w
Weight of copper in the liquid phase /H110050.78(100 /H11002w)
The total weight of copper in the alloy must equal the sum of its weight in the liquid andin the solid phases, or

Collecting similar terms

and solving for w, the weight of the solid phase,
Since the total weight of the alloy is 100 grams, the weight percent of the solid phase is31.25 percent, and the corresponding weight percent of the liquid phase is 68.75 percent.
Now reexamine the equation given above
73/H1100278/H11005(0.62 /H110020.78) w
and divide each side by 100 grams, the total weight of the alloy. If this is done, one obtains
orwhere w/100 is the weight percent of the solid phase.
The preceding equation is worthy of careful consideration. In this expression the
denominator is the difference in composition of the solid and the liquid phase (expressed
in weight percent copper), that is, it is exactly the composition difference between pointsw

phase diagram,
(a) Find the composition of the two phases.
Draw an isothermal line ( a tie line ), through the given point. The intersections of the

the phases. (In the present example, points mand ndetermine the compositions of the
phases, solid and liquid, respectively.)
(b) Find the relative amounts of the two phases.

the right of the average composition (point z), while the phase that lies at the right ( n) is
proportional to the line segment ( a) lying to the left of point z. Note that the compositions
of the two phases can be read directly from the phase diagram; however, the amounts of
the phases need to be calculated. weight fraction liquid /H11005a

317 11.4 Equilibrium Heating or Cooling of an Isomorphous Alloy
11.4 EQUILIBRIUM HEATING OR COOLING 
OF AN ISOMORPHOUS ALLOY
Equilibrium heating or cooling means a very slow rate of temperature change so that at
all times equilibrium conditions are maintained in the system under study. Just how
slowly one has to heat or cool an alloy in order to keep it effectively in a state of equilib-
rium depends on the metal under consideration and the nature of the phase changes that
occur as the temperature of the alloy is varied. For present purposes, it will arbitrarily be
assumed that all temperature changes are made at a slow enough rate that equilibrium is
constantly maintained. In Chapter 14 some aspects of nonequilibrium temperature
changes will be considered when the more intimate details of freezing are investigated. For
the time being, however, our attention will be concentrated on the phase changes that
occur as a result of temperature variations.
First, the phase changes that occur when a speciﬁc alloy of an isomorphous system
has its temperature varied through the freezing range will be considered. For this purpose,
the hypothetical phase diagram of Fig. 11.3 with assumed components Aand Bwill be
used. As an arbitrary alloy, consider the composition 70 percent Band 30 percent A. A ver-
tical line is drawn through this composition in Fig. 11.3. Two segments of this line are
drawn as solid lines ( aband cd), while the third segment between points band cis shown
as a dashed line. The solid portions fall in single-phase regions: abin the solid-solution
area, cdin the liquid-solution area. The dashed segment bclies in a two-phase region of
liquid-plus-solid phases. Any point on one of the solid sections corresponds to a single
homogeneous substance. Points in the length bc, on the other hand, do not correspond to
a single homogeneous form of matter, but to two—a liquid solution and a solid solution—
each with a different composition. Furthermore, the compositions of these phases change
as the temperature inside the two-phase region is varied. This can perhaps be best under-
stood by considering the complete cycle of the phase change that occurs as the alloy is
cooled from point ddown to room temperature at point a.
At point d, the alloy is a homogeneous liquid and, until point cis reached, it remains
as a simple homogeneous liquid. Point c, however, is the boundary of the two-phase
region, which signiﬁes that solid begins to form from the liquid at this temperature. The
freezing of the alloy, accordingly, commences at the temperature corresponding to point c.

Chapter 11 Binary Phase Diagrams 318
Conversely, when the alloy has been cooled to point b, it must be completely frozen, for at all
temperatures below bthe alloy exists as a single solid-solution phase. Point b, therefore,
corresponds to the end of the freezing process. An interesting feature of the freezing
process is at once apparent: the alloy does not freeze at a constant temperature, but overa temperature range. The temperature range from bto cis called the equilibrium freezing
range of the alloy.
The analysis of phase-change phenomena that occur in the freezing range between
points cand bcan now be made rather easily with the aid of the two rules set down at the
end of the last section. Suppose that the temperature of the alloy has been lowered to aposition just below point c. The position is designated by the symbol xin Fig. 11.3, and at
this position
(a) An isothermal line drawn through point xdetermines the composition of the
phases by its intersections with the liquidus and solidus lines, respectively.
Liquid phase (point f) has the composition 72 percent B.
Solid phase (point e) has the composition 29 percent B.
(b) By the lever rule, the amount of the solid phase is:
and the amount of the liquid phase is 95.3 percent.
The above data show that the given alloy, at a temperature slightly below the temper-
ature at which freezing starts, is still largely a liquid (95.3 percent) and the composition ofthe liquid (72 percent B) is close to the average composition. On the other hand, the solid
phase, which is present in only a small quantity (4.7 percent), possesses a composition dif-fering considerably from the average (29 percent B).
Now let us assume that the alloy is very slowly cooled from point xto point x/H11032. If this
operation is done slowly enough, equilibrium conditions will be maintained at the end ofthe drop in temperature and we can apply once more the two rules for determining thecompositions and amounts of the phases. When this is done, it is found that the composi-tion of the solid phase is now 60 percent Band that of the liquid phase is 90 percent B,
while the amount of the liquid and the solid phase is 33 percent and 67 percent, respec-tively. Comparing these ﬁgures with those for the higher temperature (corresponding topoint x) shows two important facts. First, as the temperature is lowered in the freezing
range, the amount of the solid increases, while the amount of the liquid decreases. Thisresult might well be expected. Second, as the temperature falls, the compositions of bothphases change. This fact is not self-evident. It is also interesting to note that the composi-tion shift of both phases occurs in the same direction. Both the liquid and the solid becomericher in component Bas the temperature drops lower and lower. This apparently anom-
alous result can only be explained by the fact that as the temperature falls, there is also acorresponding change in the amounts of the phases and the fact that at all times, the aver-age composition of the liquid and the solid is constant.
Another important fact relative to the freezing process in a solid-solution type of alloy
is that as the process continues and more and more solid is formed, there must be a con-tinuous composition change taking place in the solid that has already frozen. Thus, at thex/H11002f

319 11.5 The Isomorphous Alloy System from the Point of View of Free Energy
temperature of point x, the solid has the composition 29 percent B, but at the temperature
of x/H11032, it has the composition 60 percent B. The only way that this can occur is through the
agency of diffusion. Since the composition change is in the direction of increasing concen-
trations of Batoms, this implies a steady diffusion of Batoms from the liquid toward the
center of the solid, and a corresponding diffusion of Aatoms in the reverse direction.
The equilibrium freezing of an isomorphous alloy can now be analyzed. On cooling
the liquid solution, freezing starts when the liquidus line is reached (point c, Fig. 11.3). The
ﬁrst solid to form has the composition determined by the intersection of an isothermal linedrawn through point cwith the solidus line (point g). As the alloy is slowly cooled, the
composition of the solid moves along the solidus line toward point c, while, simultane-
ously, the composition of the liquid moves along the liquidus line toward point h.
However, at any given instant in the cooling process, such as typiﬁed by point xor x/H11032, the
solid and the liquid must lie at the ends of an isothermal line. In addition, as the freezingprocess proceeds, the relative amounts of liquid and solid change from an inﬁnitesimalamount of solid in a very large amount of liquid at the start of the process to the ﬁnal con-dition of complete solidiﬁcation.
The preceding discussion has been concerned with the freezing process. The reverse
process, melting, in which the alloy is heated from a low temperature, where it is a solid,into the liquid phase, is equally simple to analyze. In this case, point brepresents the tem-
perature at which melting commences, point hthe composition of the ﬁrst liquid to form,
and point gthe composition of the last solid to dissolve.
It is well to note at this point that for all compositions of an isomorphous system,
freezing or melting occurs over a range of temperatures. Thus, the melting and freezingpoints do not coincide as they do in pure metals.
11.5 THE ISOMORPHOUS ALLOY SYSTEM FROM THE POINT
OF VIEW OF FREE ENERGY
In an alloy system such as copper-nickel, the atoms of the components are so similar innature that it can be assumed, at least as a ﬁrst approximation, that they form an idealsolution in both liquid and solid phases. The free-energy-composition curves for bothphases must, therefore, be similar in nature to those in Fig. 10.6. Consider now the situa-tion that obtains at the melting point of pure nickel. At this temperature (1455°C) the freeenergies of the liquid and of the solid phases are equal at the composition of pure nickel.Figure 11.1 shows us, however, that for any other alloy composition of copper and nickelat this temperature, the liquid phase is the stable phase and, therefore, its free energy mustlie below that of the solid phase. This relationship between the two free-energy curves isshown in Fig. 11.4A. Notice that the two curves intersect only at the composition of purenickel. At any temperature higher than 1455°C, the two curves will separate so that theliquid-phase-free-energy-composition curve lies entirely below that of the solid phase. Onthe other hand, decreasing the temperature to a value that is still above the freezing pointof pure copper (1084.9°C) has the effect of shifting the curves of the liquid phase upwardwith respect to that of the solid phase. The two curves now intersect at some intermedi-ate composition, as shown in Fig. 11.4B. This ﬁgure represents the free energy of the twosolutions at the same temperature (1200°C) as points yand zin Figs. 11.1 and 11.2, respec-
tively. Notice that in this ﬁgure the common tangent drawn to the two free-energy curveshas points of tangency at the compositions 62 percent Cu and 78 percent Cu. These val-ues are the same as indicated in Figs. 11.1 and 11.2 for the compositions of the phases at11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 319

1200°C, which agrees with the results of Chapter 10, where it was shown that the points
of contact of the common tangent determine the compositions of the phases in a two-
phase mixture.
The complete copper-nickel-phase diagram can be mapped out by considering the rel-
ative motion of the two free-energy-composition curves as the temperature is dropped.
With decreasing temperature, the effect, as indicated above, is to raise the liquid-phase
curve relative to that of the solid phase. As this happens, the point of intersection shifts
continuously from the composition of pure nickel at the temperature 1455 °C to the com-
position of pure copper at 1084.9°C. Concurrent with this movement of the point of inter-
section toward larger copper concentrations is a similar motion of both points of contact
of the common tangent to the two free-energy curves. Below 1084.8 °C the two free-
energy-composition curves no longer intersect, and the curve representing the solid phase
lies entirely below the liquid curve.
11.6 MAXIMA AND MINIMA
The copper-nickel phase diagram is typical of an alloy system in which the free-energy-
composition curves, for a given temperature, of the two solution phases (liquid and solid)
intersect at only one composition. Other alloy systems are known which have equivalent
curves intersecting at two compositions. When this happens, it is generally observed that in
the corresponding phase diagrams liquidus and solidus curves are so shaped as to form
either a minimum or a maximum. This can be demonstrated graphically with the aid of
Figs. 11.5 and 11.6. Figure 11.5 shows schematically the relationships between the free-
energy curves that lead to a minimum conﬁguration. In this case, the curve for the solid
has less curvature than that for the liquid. The ﬁgure on the left of Fig. 11.5 shows that,
with decreasing temperature, intersections of the two free-energy curves occur ﬁrst at
the compositions of pure components ( Aand B). These intersections then move inward
toward the center of the ﬁgure and eventually meet at a single point. At the temperature
where this occurs ( Tc), the two free-energy curves are tangent. Continued lowering of
the temperature ( Td) causes the free-energy curves to separate and makes the solid phase11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 320

the only stable phase at all compositions. In an example such as this, it is possible to draw
two common tangents to the free-energy curves. The points at which the tangents contact
the free-energy curves determine the limits of the two-phase regions of the equilibrium dia-
gram at any given temperature—for example, Tb. The motion of these points, with varying
temperature, maps out the phase diagram shown on the right of Fig. 11.5.
A series of ﬁgures, similar to that of Fig. 11.5, is shown in Fig. 11.6. In this case, how-
ever, the solid solution is assumed to have the free-energy curve with the greater curvature,
so that the free-energy curves, on falling temperature, meet ﬁrst at a single central point at
temperature Tb. This single intersection then splits into two, with the result that the phase
diagram has the shape shown on the right of Fig. 11.6.
An important aspect of phase diagrams is shown in Figs. 11.5 and 11.6. When the
boundaries of a two-phase region intersect, they meet at a maximum or minimum, and
both curves (liquidus and solidus) are tangent to each other and to an isothermal line
at the point of intersection. Such points are called congruent points . It is characteristic of
congruent points that freezing can occur with no change in composition or tempera-
ture at these points. Thus, the freezing of an alloy at a congruent point is similar to the
freezing of a pure metal. The resulting solid, however, is a solid solution and not a pure
component.
It should be further emphasized that the boundaries that deﬁne the limits of a two-
phase region in an equilibrium diagram can only meet at either congruent points, or at
the compositions or pure components. These points, where the phase boundaries meet,11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 321

are known as singular points and, accordingly, in an equilibrium diagram, the single-phase
regions, or ﬁelds, are always separated by two-phase regions except at singular points.
A number of isomorphous phase diagrams show congruent points that correspond to
minima of the liquidus and solidus curves. A typical example is shown in Fig. 11.7, which
is the equilibrium diagram for the gold-nickel-alloy system. The signiﬁcance of the solid line
lying below the liquidus and solidus lines will be considered in Sec. 11.8 on miscibility gaps.
Congruent points at which the liquidus and solidus meet at a maxima are not ordi-
narily found in simple isomorphous equilibrium diagrams. They are observed, however, in
several more complicated alloy systems that possess more than a single solid phase. One
of the simpler systems is the lithium-magnesium system whose phase diagram is shown

Copper and gold also freeze to form a continuous series of solid solutions, as shown in
Fig. 11.9. The chemical activities of these solid solutions exhibit a negative deviation. This
fact is shown in Fig. 11.10, where it can be observed that at 500°C the activities of both
gold and copper are smaller than the corresponding mole fractions. Negative deviations
of the activities are generally considered as evidence that the components of a binary sys-
tem possess a deﬁnite attraction for each other or at least a preference for opposite atomic11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 322

forms as neighbors. An interesting result of this effect is the formation, in this system, of
ordered structures in which gold and copper atoms alternate in lattice positions in such a
way as to form the maximum number of gold-copper atomic bonds and the minimum
number of copper-copper and gold-gold bonds. At higher temperatures, thermally
induced atomic movements are too rapid to permit the grouping together of a large num-
ber of atoms in stable ordered structures. Two opposing factors, namely, the attraction of
unlike forms for each other and the disrupting inﬂuence of thermal motion, therefore,
lead to a condition known as short-range order . In this situation, gold atoms have a statis-
tically greater number of copper atoms as neighbors than would be expected if the two
atomic forms were arranged on the lattice sites of a crystal in entirely random fashion.
The effectiveness of thermal motion in destroying an extensive periodic arrangement of
the gold and copper atoms, of course, decreases with falling temperature, so that at low
temperatures and at the proper compositions gold and copper atoms can arrange them-
selves in stable conﬁgurations that extend through large regions of a crystal. When this
occurs, a state of long-range order is said to exist and the resulting structure is called a
superlattice or a superstructure .
An ordered region of a crystal is known as a domain . The maximum theoretical size of
a domain is determined by the size of the crystal or grain in which the domain lies. Usually,
however, a given metal grain will contain a number of domains, and the relationship
between grains and domains is indicated in Fig. 11.11. A portion of two schematic ordered
crystals is shown based on the assumption of equal numbers of black ( A) and white ( B)11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 323

atoms. The grain at the upper left of the ﬁgure contains three domains, while that at the
lower right has two. At the domain boundaries, which are outlined by dashed lines,
Aatoms face Aatoms, and Batoms face Batoms. Inside of each domain, each Aatom and
each Batom is surrounded by atoms of the opposite kind. At the juncture between two
domains, the sequence of the Aand Batoms is reversed and it is common practice to call
the domains antiphase domains and the boundaries antiphase boundaries . In the copper-gold
system, the transformation from short-range order to long-range order produces supperlat-
tices within three basic composition ranges. One of these regions surrounds the composi-
tion corresponding to equal numbers of gold and copper atoms, and the others have a 3 to 1
ratio of either copper to gold or gold to copper. Each superlattice is a phase in the usual
sense and is stable inside a deﬁnite range of temperature and composition. Five different
superstructures have been identiﬁed in the copper-gold system: two corresponding to the
composition CuAu, one to the composition Au3Cu and two for AuCu3. The boundaries
delineating the two-phase region surrounding each superlattice phase meet at congruent
maxima. The congruent maximum of the Cu3Au phase appears at 390°C, while the max-
ima of CuAu lie at 410° and 385°C. Notice that with respect to the CuAu phases, the lower
temperature phase is formed on cooling from the higher termperature phase. Thus, when
an alloy with a composition approximately equal to AuCu cools down from a temperature
near the solidus, it ﬁrst transforms from the high-temperature short-range ordered phase
(disordered face-centered cubic phase) to the phase designated in Fig. 11.9 as AuCuII
(orthorhombic). On further cooling, this latter phase transforms into AuCuI (tetragonal).11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 324

Similarly, the gold-rich AuCu3composition transforms to AuCu3I (orthorhombic) at high
temperatures, then to AuCu3(face-centered cubic) at lower temperatures. The structure of
the Au3Cu phase is also based on the face-centered cubic lattice.
The unit cells of two of the ﬁve superlattices of the copper-gold system are shown in
Fig. 11.12. The left drawing shows the structure of Cu3AuI. It is merely a face-centered
cubic unit cell with copper atoms at the face centers and gold atoms at the corners. It is
easily proved that this conﬁguration corresponds to the stoichiometric ratio Cu3Au. There
are six face-centered copper atoms, each belonging to two unit cells, or a total of three cop-
per atoms per unit cell. On the other hand, there are eight corner atoms, each belonging
to eight unit cells, or one gold atom per unit cell. A perfect lattice, composed of unit cells
of this nature, has a ratio of three copper atoms to each gold atom. Actually, as the phase
diagram shows, the Cu3Au structure, as well as the CuAu structures, is capable of existing
over a range of compositions. This range is somewhat limited because, as one deviates
from the strict stoichiometric ratios, the perfection of the order decreases and with it the
stability of the superlattices.
The right diagram in Fig. 11.12 represents the unit cell of the lower-temperature
CuAu phase (CuAuI, or tetragonal phase). This structure is also a modiﬁcation of the face-
centered cubic lattice with alternating (001) planes completely ﬁlled with gold and copper
atoms. The tetragonality of this phase is directly related to the alternating stacking of
planes of gold atoms and planes of copper atoms. Such a structure has axes of equal length
in a plane containing atoms of the same type, but an axis of different length in the direc-
tion perpendicular to this plane. The unit cell is thus distorted from a cube into a tetragon.
The other phase, CuAuII, has a somewhat more complicated structure that will not be
described, but it can be considered an intermediate step between the short-range-ordered,
high-temperature face-centered cubic structure and the low-temperature-ordered tetrag-
onal structure.
Ordered phases are found in a number of alloy systems.1One of these that has been
studied extensively occurs in the copper-zinc system and corresponds to an equal number
of copper and zinc atoms. This phase will be considered brieﬂy later in this chapter.
11.8 MISCIBILITY GAPS
Gold and nickel, like copper and nickel and copper and gold, also form an alloy system that
freezes into solid solutions in all proportions. See the phase diagram in Fig. 11.7. This sys-
tem serves as an example of a completely soluble system in which the constituents tend
to segregate as the temperature is lowered. Consider now the curved line that occupies the
lower central region of the phase diagram. At all temperatures below 810.3°C and inside
the indicated line, two phases are stable, a1and a2. The ﬁrst, a1, is a phase based on the11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 326
327 11.8 Miscibility Gaps
gold lattice with nickel in solution, and the other, a2, nickel with gold in solution. Both
phases are face-centered cubic, but differ in lattice parameters, densities, color, and other
physical properties.
The two-phase ﬁeld, where a1and a2are both stable, constitutes an example of
what is commonly called a miscibility gap . A necessary condition for the formation of a
miscibility gap in the solid state is that both components should crystallize in the samelattice form.
In Chapter 10, it was pointed out that many alloy systems have solvus lines that show
increasing solubility of the solute with rising temperature. It is quite possible to considerthe boundary of the miscibility gap as two solvus lines that meet at high temperatures toform a single boundary separating the two-phase ﬁeld from the surrounding single-phaseﬁelds.
The gold-nickel system is particularly signiﬁcant because it demonstrates that there
is still much to learn about solid-state reactions. When a binary alloy is formed betweenAand Batoms, there are two possible types of atomic bonds between nearest neighbors:
bonds between atoms of the same kind ( A-Aor B-Bbonds), and bonds between unlike
atoms ( A-Bbonds). Associated with each bond between a pair of atoms is a chemical
bonding energy which may be written as /H9255
AAor /H9255BBfor pairs of like atoms, and /H9255ABfor a
pair of unlike atoms. The total energy of the alloy may, of course, be written as the sumof the energies of all the bonds between neighboring atoms; the lower this energy themore stable the metal. If now the bonding energy between unlike atoms is the sameas the average bonding energy between like atoms (/H9255
AA/H11001/H9255BB), then there is no essen-
tial difference between the bonds, and the solution should be a random solid solution.When /H9255
ABis lower than the average bonding energy of like atoms, short-range order at
higher temperatures and long-range order at lower temperatures are to be expected. Onthe other hand, segregation and precipitation are usually associated with the conditionwhere /H9255
ABis greater than ( /H9255AA/H11001/H9255BB).
The fact that gold-nickel alloys exhibit a miscibility gap would generally be con-
strued as evidence that the bonding energy for a gold-nickel pair is larger than the aver-age of the bond energies for gold-gold and nickel-nickel pairs because this effect isexpected in segregation. Thermodynamic measurements of solid solutions of thesealloys at temperatures above the miscibility gap show that the activities of both gold andnickel exhibit positive deviations. This fact also normally indicates that unlike pairs havea higher bond energy and that gold and nickel atoms prefer to segregate. However, X-ray diffraction measurements show a small but deﬁnite short-range order to exist in thesolid solutions above the miscibility gap. This apparent contradiction is strong evidencethat there is more than one factor involved in determining the type of structure thatresults. The simple, so-called quasi-chemical theory, which pictures the development ofsegregation, or ordering, as the result of only the magnitudes of the interatomic bond-ing energies, is not sufﬁcient to explain the observed results in the gold-nickel system.Other factors certainly must be involved in determining the nature of the solid-statereactions that occur in solid-solution alloys. In the gold-nickel system, the ambiguousresults have been explained as being primarily due to the large difference in size of thegold and nickel atoms.
2This difference amounts to about 15 percent and is at the Hume-
Rothery limiting value for extensive solubility. When a random solid solution is formedof gold and nickel atoms, the ﬁt between atoms is rather poor and the lattice is badlystrained. One way that the strain energy associated with the misﬁt of gold and nickelatoms can be relieved is by causing the atoms to assume an ordered arrangement. Less1

Chapter 11 Binary Phase Diagrams 328
strain is produced when gold and nickel atoms alternate in a crystal than when gold or
nickel atoms cluster together. By this means, it is possible to explain the short-range
order that exists at high temperatures. A still greater decrease in the strain energy of the
lattice is possible if it breaks down to form crystals of the gold-rich and nickel-rich
phases. Notice that, in this event, it is postulated that separate crystals of the two phases
are formed with conventional grain boundaries between them, and that we are not talk-
ing about coherent clusters of gold atoms or nickel atoms existing in the original solid-
solution crystals. Clustering in the coherent sense would raise, not lower, the strain
energy. The nucleation of the segregated phases in a solid solution in which clustering
does not occur is, of course, a difﬁcult process, and the precipitation of the phases inside
the miscibility gap of the gold-nickel system is a very slow and time-consuming process
that is apparently only nucleated at the grain boundaries of the matrix phase.
Miscibility gaps are not only found in solid solutions, but also often in the liquid
regions of phase diagrams. A particular liquid miscibility gap will be discussed in a later
section.
11.9 EUTECTIC SYSTEMS
The copper-silver phase diagram, Fig. 11.13, can be taken as representative of eutectic
systems. In systems of this type, there is always a speciﬁc alloy, known as the eutectic com-
position , that freezes at a lower temperature than all other compositions. Under conditions
approaching equilibrium (slow-cooling), it freezes at a single temperature like a pure
metal. In other respects, the solidiﬁcation reaction of this composition is quite different

from that of a pure metal since it freezes to form a mixture of two different solid phases.
Hence, at the eutectic temperature, two solids form simultaneously from a single liquidphase. A transformation, where one phase is converted into two other phases, requiresthat three phases be in equilibrium. In Chapter 10, it was shown that, assuming constantpressure, three phases can only be in equilibrium at an invariant point, that is, at a con-stant composition (in this case the eutectic composition) and at a constant temperature(eutectic temperature). The eutectic temperature and composition determine a point onthe phase diagram called the eutectic point , which occurs in the copper-silver system at
28.1 percent Cu and 779.4°C.
At this time, it is perhaps well to compare Fig. 11.7, showing the gold-nickel equilib-
rium diagram and its miscibility gap, with the copper-silver diagram of Fig. 11.13. The closerelationship between the two systems is evident. The copper-silver system corresponds toone in which the miscibility gap and the solidus lines intersect. The eutectic point, there-fore, is equivalent to the minimum point in the gold-nickel system. In the gold-nickel sys-tem, however, an alloy with the composition of the minimum ﬁrst solidiﬁes as a singlehomogeneous solid solution and then, on further cooling, breaks down into two solidphases as it passes into the miscibility gap. An alloy possessing the eutectic composition ofthe copper-silver system, on the other hand, freezes directly into a two-phase mixture.
The fundamental requirement for a miscibility gap is a tendency for atoms of the same
kind to segregate in the solid state. The same is also true of an eutectic system. A true mis-cibility gap, like that in the gold-nickel system, can only occur if the component metals arevery similar chemically and crystallize in the same lattice form, since the components mustbe capable of dissolving in each other at high temperatures. In an eutectic system, thecomponents do not have to crystallize in the same structure nor do they necessarily haveto be chemically similar. If the two atomic forms are quite different chemically, however,then intermediate crystal structures are liable to form in the alloy system. Eutectics can stillbe observed in such systems, but they will not form between terminal phases, as shownin Fig. 11.13.
11.10 THE MICROSTRUCTURES OF EUTECTIC SYSTEMS
Any composition of an isomorphous system at equilibrium and in the solid state consistsof a single homogeneous group of solid-solution crystals. When viewed under the micro-scope, such a structure does not differ essentially from that of a pure metal. It is usuallydifﬁcult, therefore, to tell much about the composition of these single-phased alloys froma study of their microstructure alone. On the other hand, the appearance under the micro-scope of an alloy from the two-phase ﬁeld (solid) of an eutectic system is very character-istic of its composition.
In discussing the microstructure and other aspects of the alloys of an eutectic
system, it is customary to classify them with respect to the side of the eutectic composi-tion on which they fall. Compositions lying to the left of the eutectic point are desig-nated as hypoeutectic , while those to the right are called hypereutectic . These designations
are easily remembered if one recalls the fact that hypo- and hyper - are Greek preﬁxes sig-
nifying below and above. Thus, reading the copper-silver equilibrium diagram in theusual way from left to right (increasing copper content), it is found that alloys with lessthan 28.1 percent Cu (eutectic composition) fall in the hypoeutectic class, whereas thosecontaining more than 28.1 percent Cu belong to the hypereutectic group.11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 329

FIG. 11.13 A hypoeutectic structure from the copper-silver phase diagram
containing approximately 24 percent copper. Lighter oval regions are proeu-
tectic alpha dendrites, while the gray background is the eutectic structure
Figure 11.14 shows the microstructure of an alloy of 24 percent Cu and 76 percent Ag.
Since this composition contains less copper than 28.1 percent (eutectic composition), the
alloy is hypoeutectic. Two distinct structures are visible in the photograph: a more or lesscontinuous gray area, inside of which is found a number of oval-shaped white areas. Noticethat both the white and gray regions have their own characteristic appearance. Copper-sil-ver alloys that contain between 8.8 percent and 28.1 percent Cu and are slowly cooled fromthe liquid phase, will show varying amounts of these two structures. The amount of thegray structure increases from zero to 100 percent as the composition of the alloy is changedfrom 8.8 percent to 28.1 percent. Figure 11.15 is another photomicrograph of the samealloy, but in this case the magniﬁcation is higher. What appears as a rough gray structure atlower magniﬁcation is shown by Fig. 11.15 to be an aggregate of small platelets of one phasein a matrix of another phase. This is the eutectic structure of the copper-silver system. Thesmall platelets are composed of a copper-rich phase, while the continuous matrix is a silver-rich phase. The two phases forming the eutectic have colors that are characteristic of theelement which is present in each in the greater amount. The copper-rich area is tinted red,while the silver-rich is white, so that both phases are clearly visible in a polished specimenthat has not been etched. (In the present photographs, the specimens were etched toincrease the contrast.) Careful study of Fig. 11.15 shows that the large white oval areas thathave no copper particles are continuous with the white areas of the eutectic regions. Theseare, accordingly, extended regions of the silver-rich phase.
From the above, it can be concluded that hypoeutectic alloys in this alloy system
possess a microstructure consisting of a mixture of the eutectic structure and regionscontaining only the silver-rich phase. The important thing to notice is that in a photograph11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 330

FIG. 11.15 The microstructure of Fig. 11.14 shown at a greater magniﬁcation.
(White matrix is the alpha or silver-rich phase. Dark small platelets are the beta
or copper-rich phase. The eutectic structure is thus composed of beta plateletsin an alpha matrix.)
of an eutectic alloy, such as Fig. 11.14, the features of the structure that stand out are not
the phases themselves, but the contrast between the eutectic structure and the regions inwhich only a single phase exists. It is customary to call these parts of the microstructure thathave a clearly identiﬁable appearance under the microscope, the constituents of the structure.
Unfortunately, the term constituent is frequently confused with the term component . The
words actually have quite different meanings. The components of an alloy system are thepure elements (or compounds) from which the alloys are formed. In the present case, theyare pure copper and pure silver. The constituents, on the other hand, are the things that wesee as clearly deﬁnable features of the microstructure. They may be either phases, such asthe white regions in Fig. 11.14, or mixtures of phases, the gray eutectic regions of Fig. 11.14.
The microstructure in Fig. 11.14 is characteristic of an eutectic alloy that has been
cooled (slowly) from the liquid phase. Cold-working and annealing this alloy will notchange the amounts of the phases that appear in the microstructure, but such a treatmentcan well change the shape and distribution of the phases. In other words, Fig. 11.14 showsthe structure of a hypoeutectic copper-silver alloy in the cast state, and it follows that whatwe see in this photograph is a function of the freezing process of the eutectic alloy.
Some of the details of the freezing process in alloys of an eutectic system will now be
considered. For this purpose, we shall assume that the alloys are cooled from the liquid stateto a temperature slightly below the eutectic temperature. At this temperature all composi-tions will be completely solidiﬁed, but considerations of the effect on the microstructures ofthe solvus lines, which show a decrease in solubility of the phases with decreasing temper-atures, are eliminated. Actually, the change in the microstructure caused by the decreasing11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 331
Chapter 11 Binary Phase Diagrams 332
solubilities of the phases is, in general, slight and will be discussed brieﬂy after we have
explained the nature of the equilibrium freezing process.
A vertical line is shown in Fig. 11.13 that passes through the composition 24 percent
Cu. This line represents the average composition of the alloy whose microstructure isshown in Fig. 11.14. At temperatures above point a, the alloy is in the liquid phase.
Cooling to a temperature below point acauses it to enter a two-phase region where the
stable phases are liquid and the alpha solid. The latter is a solid solution of copper in sil-ver. Freezing of the given composition, accordingly, starts with the formation of crystalsthat are almost completely silver in composition (point b). Until the alloy reaches the
eutectic temperature, the freezing process is similar to that of an isomorphous alloy withthe liquid and solid moving along the liquidus and solidus lines respectively. The silver-rich crystals that form in this manner grow as many-branched skeletons called dendrites
whose nature will be explained in Chapter 14. It sufﬁces for the present to point out thatwhen the alloy has cooled to just above the eutectic temperature (point c), it contains a
number of skeleton crystals immersed in a liquid phase. Using the previously stated rulesfor analyzing a two-phase alloy at a given temperature, it is evident that the compositionof the liquid at this temperature must correspond to the eutectic composition (point d).
The solid phase, on the other hand, has a composition 8.8 percent Cu (point e). Since the
average composition falls at a point about four-ﬁfths of the way (24 /H110028.8 percent) from
the composition of the solid phase to that of the liquid phase (28.1 /H110028.8 percent), it is to
be expected, by the lever rule, that the ratio of liquid to solid will be approximately 4 to 1.
Immediately above the eutectic temperature the alloy is a mixture of liquid and solid.
The solid is in the form of dendrites surrounded by the liquid phase of the eutectic com-position. Further cooling of the alloy freezes this liquid at the eutectic temperature. Sucha freezing process results in the formation of the eutectic structure: a mixture of two solidphases (copper platelets in a matrix of silver) that freezes between the branches of thesilver-rich crystals. A cross-section of a structure formed in this way has the appearanceshown in Fig. 11.14. Since just above the eutectic temperature four-ﬁfths of the alloy isliquid eutectic, it is to be expected that four-ﬁfths of the completely solidiﬁed alloy willconsist of eutectic solid. The remaining ﬁfth of the structure corresponds to the silver-richdendrites that form during the freezing process at temperatures above the eutectic temper-ature. In Fig. 11.14 this part of the structure is the clear oval-shaped areas. The explana-tion of their shape is readily apparent if one considers that the plane of the photographrepresents a cross-section of the arms of the skeleton crystal.
In a hypoeutectic alloy of the type shown in Fig. 11.14 or 11.15, the silver phase
appears in two locations: in the eutectic, where it is present with the copper particles, andin the dendrite arms, where it is the only phase. The copper-rich phase, on the other hand,only appears in the eutectic structure. It is common practice to differentiate between thetwo forms of the silver-rich phase and to designate the dendritic silver-rich regions as“primary.” The remaining silver-rich regions are designated eutectic . The primary regions
are also commonly called the proeutectic constituent since they form at temperatures above
the eutectic temperature.
All hypoeutectic compositions between 8.8 percent Cu and 28.1 percent Cu solidify in
a manner similar to the 24 percent composition that has just been discussed. The ratio ofthe eutectic to the primary alpha phase in the alloys after they have passed through theeutectic temperature, of course, varies with the composition of the metal. The amount ofeutectic in the microstructure increases directly with increasing copper content as we move11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 332
333 11.10 The Microstructures of Eutectic Systems
from the composition 8.8 percent Cu to 28.1 percent Cu. At this latter value the structure
will be entirely eutectic; at the former value it will consist of only primary alpha crystals.
At compositions below 8.8 percent Cu all alloys freeze, under equilibrium conditions,
in an isomorphous manner and are single-phased (as long as they are not lowered belowthe solvus line). When cooled below the solvus line, these compositions (0 to 8.8 percentCu) become supersaturated and precipitate beta-phase (copper-rich) particles. This meansthat they are theoretically capable of age-hardening and the precipitation processesdescribed in Chapter 16 apply. Notice that this phenomenon does not develop the eutecticstructure that can only be formed when a liquid of the eutectic composition is solidiﬁed.
Let us now focus our attention on hypereutectic copper-silver alloys. Figure 11.16
shows a typical microstructure of one of these compositions (50 percent Cu–50 percentAg). A vertical line is drawn through the appropriate composition in Fig. 11.13 to showwhere this alloy falls on the phase diagram. When hypereutectic alloys (28.1 percent Cuto 92 percent Cu) are cooled from the liquid state, the copper-rich beta phase forms fromthe liquid until the eutectic temperature is reached. This depletion of the copper contentof the liquid shifts the liquid composition (along the liquidus line) toward the eutecticcomposition. After the eutectic temperature is passed, the resulting microstructure is amixture of primary beta plus eutectic. The primary beta appears in Fig. 11.16 as oval-shaped dark areas. The structure of the eutectic in this alloy is the same as in the hypoeu-tectic alloys—copper particles in a matrix of silver. One very interesting feature can be seenby comparing this microstructure with the comparable hypoeutectic structure ofFig. 11.15. In both cases, the silver phase is the continuous phase, while the copper phaseis discontinuous. Thus, the alpha, or silver-rich, phase of the eutectic is continuous with
FIG. 11.16 Hypereutectic copper-silver structure consisting of proeutectic
beta (large dark areas) and eutectic.11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 333
Chapter 11 Binary Phase Diagrams 334
the primary silver dendrite arms in the hypoeutectic structure, but in the hypereutectic
structure the primary copper-rich phase is not continuous with the copper phase in theeutectic. Similar results, where one phase tends to surround the other phase, are found inother eutectic systems besides the copper-silver system.
The amount of the eutectic structure in hypereutectic alloys varies directly with the
change in copper concentration as one moves from 28.1 percent Cu to 92 percent Cu; decreas-ing from 100 percent at the former composition to 0 percent at the latter. Above 92 percentCu to 100 percent Cu, all compositions freeze in an isomorphous manner to form single-phased (beta or copper-rich) structures. The latter, on cooling to room temperature, becomesupersaturated in silver and are subject to precipitation of the alpha phase. This effect is exactlyanalogous to that observed in the silver-rich alloys containing less than 8.8 percent Cu.
The effect of cooling the various compositions lying between 8.8 percent Cu and
92 percent Cu from the eutectic temperature to room temperature still remains to bedescribed. In general, all of these alloys will contain part of the eutectic structure and are,therefore, two-phase structures. According to the phase diagram, both the alpha phase andthe beta phase have decreasing solubilities with temperature and, on slow-cooling, bothphases tend to approach the pure state, which means that copper will diffuse out of thesilver-rich phase and silver will diffuse out of the copper-rich phase. With sufﬁcient slow-cooling, no new particles of either phase should form since it will be easier, for example, forthe silver atoms leaving the beta phase to enter the alpha phase which is already present,than it will be to nucleate additional alpha particles. The net effect of the decreasing solu-bility of the phases (with falling temperature) upon the appearance of the microstructure istherefore small.
A ﬁnal word should be said about the signiﬁcance of the eutectic point. Hypoeutectic
compositions, when cooled from the liquid phase, start to solidify as silver-rich crystals.The liquidus line to the left of the eutectic point can, therefore, be considered as the locusof temperatures at which various liquid compositions will start to freeze out the alphaphase. Similarly, the liquidus line to the right of the eutectic point represents the locus oftemperatures at which the beta phase will form from the liquid phase. The eutectic point,which occurs at the intersection of the two liquidus lines, is, therefore, the point (withrespect to temperature and composition) at which the liquid phase can change simultane-ously into both alpha and beta phases.
11.11 THE PERITECTIC TRANSFORMATION
The eutectic reaction, in which a liquid transforms into two solid phases, is just one of thepossible three-phase reactions that can occur in binary systems. Another that appears fre-quently involves a reaction between a liquid and a solid that forms a new and differentsolid phase. This three-phase transformation occurs at a peritectic point.
Figure 11.17 shows the constitution diagram of the iron-nickel system. A peritectic
point appears at the upper left-hand corner. An enlarged view of this region is given inFig. 11.18.
Before studying the peritectic reaction, some of the basic features of the alloy system in
question should be considered. Iron and nickel have apparent atomic diameters that arealmost identical (Fe, 0.2476 nm and Ni, 0.2486 nm). Since both iron and nickel belong togroup VIII of the periodic table, these two elements are chemically similar. Both crystallizein the face-centered cubic system; nickel is face-centered cubic at all temperatures butiron only in the range 912°C to 1394°C. Conditions are thus ideal for the formation of asimple isomorphous system except for the fact that the stable crystalline form of iron is11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 334

body-centered cubic at temperatures above 1394°C and below 912°C. It is not surprising,
therefore, that iron-nickel alloys are face-centered cubic except for two small body-centered
cubic ﬁelds at the upper and lower left-hand corners of the phase diagram.
Figure 11.17 also shows that a superlattice transformation, based on the composition
FeNi3, occurs in this system. The boundaries delineating this face-centered cubic order-
disorder transformation appear at the lower right-hand side of the phase diagram.11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 335
Chapter 11 Binary Phase Diagrams 336
The addition of nickel to iron increases the stability of the face-centered cubic phase.
As a consequence, the temperature range in which this crystalline phase is preferred
expands with increasing nickel content, and the boundaries separating the body-centeredcubic ﬁelds from the face-centered ﬁeld slope upward and downward respectively (withincreasing nickel content).
With reference to Fig. 11.18, let us consider only that part of the diagram that lies
above 1394 °C. According to normal terminology, the high-temperature form of the body-centered cubic phase that appears in this temperature range is called the delta ( d) phase,
whereas the face-centered cubic phase is designated the gamma ( g) phase.
In the indicated temperature interval, when the composition of the alloy is very close
to pure iron, delta is the stable phase. With increased nickel content, the stable structurebecomes the gamma phase. Liquid alloys of very low-nickel concentrations ( /H110213.4 percent
Ni) freeze directly to the body-centered cubic phase, whereas those containing more than6.2 percent Ni freeze to form the face-centered cubic phase.
The composition interval 3.4 percent Ni to 6.2 percent Ni represents a transition inter-
val in which the product of the freezing reaction shifts from the delta to the gamma phase.The focal point of this part of the phase diagram is the peritectic point, which occurs at4.5 percent Ni (the peritectic composition) and 1512°C (the peritectic temperature).
With the aid of the dashed line adin Fig. 11.18, one can follow the freezing reaction
of an alloy of peritectic composition. Solidiﬁcation starts when the temperature of the liq-uid phase reaches point b. Between this point and the peritectic temperature, the alloy
moves through a two-phase ﬁeld of liquid and delta phases. Solidiﬁcation, therefore, com-mences with the formation of body-centered cubic dendrites that are low in nickel. Theliquid, accordingly, is enriched in nickel. At a temperature immediately above the peritec-tic temperature (1512 °C), the rules for analyzing a two-phase mixture give us:
The composition of the phases:
delta phase 3.4 percent Ni
liquid phase 6.2 percent Ni
The amount of each phase (by lever rule):
delta phase 61 percentliquid phase 39 percent
Directly above the peritectic temperature, an alloy of the peritectic composition has a
structure composed of solid delta-phase crystals in a matrix of liquid phase. On the otherhand, the phase diagram shows that just below the peritectic temperature, the given alloylies in a single-phase ﬁeld (gamma), signifying a simple homogeneous solid-solution phase.Cooling through the peritectic temperature combines the delta and liquid phases to form thegamma phase. This is the iron-nickel peritectic transformation. In this particular system, theperitectic point is the direct consequence of the fact that the liquid phase freezes to form twodifferent crystalline forms in adjacent composition ranges, and of the fact that one of thephases (gamma) is the more stable at lower temperatures and, therefore, displaces the other.
Notice that the peritectic reaction, like the eutectic, involves a ﬁxed ratio of the react-
ing phases: 61 percent delta (3.4 percent Ni) combines with 39 percent liquid (6.2 percentNi) to form the gamma phase (4.5 percent Ni). If an alloy at the peritectic temperature doesnot contain this exact ratio of liquid phase to delta phase, the reaction cannot be completeand some of the phase that is in excess will remain after the peritectic temperature is passed.Compositions in the interval 3.4 percent to 4.5 percent Ni, which lie to the left of the11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 336
337 11.12 Monotectics
peritectic composition, contain an excess of the delta phase (more than 61 percent) imme-
diately above 1512°C. On passing through the peritectic temperature, they enter a two-
phase ﬁeld: delta phase and gamma phase. Similarly, alloys to the right of the peritectic
point, lying between 4.5 percent Ni and 6.2 percent Ni, after passing through the peritectic
temperature, enter a two-phase ﬁeld: gamma phase and liquid phase.
11.12 MONOTECTICS
Monotectics represent another form of three-phase transformation in which a liquid phase
transforms into a solid phase and a liquid phase of different composition. Monotectic trans-
formations are associated with miscibility gaps in the liquid state. A reaction of this type
occurs in the copper-lead system at 955°C and 37.4 percent Pb, as can be seen in Fig. 11.19.
Notice the similarity between this monotectic and the eutectic of the copper-silver system
(Fig. 11.13). The liquid miscibility gap lies just to the right of the monotectic point.
Note that the copper-lead phase diagram also possesses an eutectic point at 327.5°C
and 99.9 percent Pb (0.1 percent Cu). Because it lies so close to the composition of pure
lead, it is not possible to show it on the scale of the present diagram. Finally, this system is
representative of one composed of elements that do not mix in the solid state; at room
temperature the solubility of copper in lead is less than 0.007 percent, while the solubility
of lead in copper is of the order of 0.002 to 0.005 percent Pb. The terminal solid solutions
are, accordingly, nearly pure elements.

11.13 OTHER THREE-PHASE REACTIONS
The three basic types of three-phase reactions (eutectics, peritectics, and monotectics) that
we have studied so far involve transformations between the liquid and solid phases. They
are, therefore, associated with the freezing or melting processes in alloys. Several other
important three-phase reactions involve only changes between solid phases. The most
important of these occurs at eutectoid and peritectoid points. At an eutectoid point, a solid
phase decomposes into two other solid phases when it is cooled. The reverse is true at a
peritectoid point where, on cooling, two solid phases combine to form a single solid phase.
The similarity between the eutectoid and peritectoid transformations on the one hand and
the eutectic and peritectic transformations on the other hand is quite obvious. A summary

rate solid phases, and L1and L2are immiscible liquids.
A very important eutectoid reaction occurs in the iron-carbon system and will be con-
sidered in considerable detail at a later point.
11.14 INTERMEDIATE PHASES
Intermediate phases, also known as intermetallic phases , are the rule rather than the
exception in phase diagrams. Equilibrium diagrams given to this point were selected
for their simplicity in order to demonstrate certain basic principles. Except for
ordered or superlattice phases, no intermediate phases have been shown. Several
important features of alloy systems that contain intermediate phases will now be
treated briefly.
The silver-magnesium phase diagram (Fig. 11.20) is of interest in the study of
intermediate phases since it shows two basic ways in which the single-phase ﬁelds
associated with intermediate phases are formed. This alloy system possesses a total of
ﬁve solid phases, of which two are terminal phases (alpha—fcc based on the silver
lattice, and delta—cph based on the magnesium lattice). Both the Ag3Mg, beta prime
and epsilon phases (the intermediate phases) are stable over a range of composition
and are, therefore, examples of true solid solutions.

Figure 11.20 shows that the b/H11032phase is centered about a composition having equal
numbers of magnesium and silver atoms. In order that this fact might be clearly visible,
the diagram has been plotted in atomic percent. This phase is a superlattice based on thebody-centered cubic structure. With exactly equal numbers of silver and magnesiumatoms, a space lattice results, in which the corner atoms of the unit cell are of one form,while the atom at the center of the cell is of the other type. An example of this type ofstructure in a different system is shown in Fig. 11.24. The b/H11032phase in the present alloy
system is interesting in that the ordered structure is stable to the melting point. In orderto indicate that the given structure is not a simple random solid solution, the symbol b/H11032
rather than bhas been used.
The b/H11032phase ﬁeld is bounded at its upper end by a maximum having coordinates of
820°C and 50 atomic percent Mg. This body-centered cubic phase, therefore, forms onfreezing by passing through a typical maximum conﬁguration of liquidus and solidus lines.On the other hand, the upper limits of the single-phase ﬁeld of the epsilon phase termi-nate in a typical peritectic point at 492°C and 75 atomic percent Mg. Formation of thislatter phase (which has a complex, not completely resolved, crystalline structure), accord-ingly, results from a peritectic reaction.
The preceding paragraph has defined two basic ways that intermediate phases are
formed during freezing—either by a transformation at a congruent maximum orthrough a peritectic reaction. Both types of reaction are common in phase diagrams.Intermediate phases may also form as a result of a transformation that takes place inthe solid state. The formation of superlattices from solid solutions possessing a stateof short-range order at congruent maxima has already been discussed. New solidphases may also form at peritectoid points that are the solid-state equivalent of peri-tectic points.
Returning now to the silver-magnesium system, Fig. 11.20 also shows that this sys-
tem, in addition to the peritectic point and the congruent point, also possesses two eutec-tic points. The ﬁrst lies at 59.3°C and 33.4 atomic percent Mg and corresponds to a reactionin which a liquid transforms into an eutectic mixture of the aand b/H11032phases. The other
eutectic point, at 472°C and 82.43 atomic percent Mg, yields an eutectic structure which isa mixture of the /H9255and dphases. Notice that, in each case, the eutectic structures are
composed of different sets of phases.
The intermediate phases in the silver-magnesium system are solid solutions stable
over relatively wide composition ranges. Thus, at 200°C, the single-phase field of theb/H11032phase extends from approximately 42 atomic percent Mg to 52 atomic percent Mg,
while that of the /H9255phase covers the composition range from 75 atomic percent Mg to
79 atomic percent Mg. Many intermediate phases, on the other hand, have single-phase fields that are vertical lines. Such phases are commonly classed as intermetallic
compounds .
Intermediate phases of the compound type are formed during freezing in the same
manner as the solid-solution phases; they may form either at congruent maxima or atperitectic points. The equilibrium diagram of the magnesium-nickel system, Fig. 11.21,which is also plotted in atomic percent, shows both a congruent point (1147 °C and67 percent Ni) and a peritectic point (750°C and 33.3 percent Ni). In this respect, it is anal-ogous to the silver-magnesium system and, like the former, it also possesses two eutecticpoints. The only basic difference between the two systems lies in the absence of solubilityin the phases of this latter system.11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 340

In the magnesium-nickel system, all phases, including the terminal phases, have
very limited single-phase fields. The compound MgNi2crystallizes in a hexagonal
lattice. This phase may have a small compositional range at high temperatures, as
indicated by the dashed lines. The other intermetallic phase appears at a ratio of the
components equivalent to 1 nickel atom to 2 magnesium atoms or Mg2Ni.
The ﬁrst compound (MgNi2) freezes or melts at a congruent maximum point. The
vertical dashed lines representing this compound can be considered to divide the phase
diagram into two independent parts. Each of these parts is a phase diagram in itself, as
is shown in Fig. 11.22, where only the left section of the complete nickel-magnesium
diagram is located. This partial diagram can be considered the nickel-MgNi2phase
diagram: a system with one component an element and the other a compound.
11.15 THE COPPER-ZINC PHASE DIAGRAM
The equilibrium diagram of the copper-zinc system is shown in Fig. 11.23. Since copper-
zinc alloys comprise the commercially important group of alloys known as brasses, the
diagram is important for this reason alone. It is also signiﬁcant because it is representa-
tive of a group of binary-equilibrium diagrams formed when one of the noble metals
(Au, Ag, Cu) is alloyed with such elements as zinc and silicon. Attention is called to the
fact that Fig. 11.23 is plotted in atomic percent. A weight-percent scale is given across11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 341

the top of this diagram and it can be seen that copper-zinc compositions are almost iden-
tical when expressed in either weight or atomic percentages.
The seven solid phases in the copper-zinc system are classiﬁed as follows:
Terminal phases :
alpha ( a) fcc based on the copper lattice
eta ( h) cph based on the zinc lattice
Intermediate phases :
beta ( b) disordered body-centered cubic
beta prime ( b/H11032) ordered body-centered cubic
gamma ( g) cubic, low symmetry
delta ( d) body-centered cubic
epsilon ( /H9255) close-packed hexagonal
Except for the alpha and beta-prime phases, all single-phase ﬁelds terminate at their
high-temperature extremities in peritectic points. There are, accordingly, ﬁve peritectic
points in Fig. 11.23. The delta phase differs from the others in that it is stable over a rather
limited temperature range (700°C to 558°C). Notice that the delta-phase ﬁeld terminates
at its lower end in an eutectoid point.
Another signiﬁcant feature of this phase diagram is the order-disorder transformation
that occurs in the body-centered cubic phase ( b/H11002b/H11032). Near room temperature, the b/H11032ﬁeld
extends from about 48 percent to 50 percent Zn. The stoichiometric composition CuZn11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 342

falls at the edge of the b/H11032ﬁeld (50 percent Zn). The ordered body-centered cubic phase is,
therefore, one that is based on a ratio of approximately one zinc to one copper atom. In
this respect, it is similar to the copper-gold ordered phase CuAu, but here the structure is
body-centered, whereas the CuAu phase is based on the face-centered cubic lattice.
Ordering with equal numbers of two atomic forms in a body-centered cubic lattice pro-
duces a structure in which each atom is completely surrounded by atoms of the opposite
kind (see Fig. 11.24). An example in the silver-magnesium system has already been men-
tioned. The atomic arrangement can be visualized by imagining that in each unit cell of
the crystal, the corner atoms are copper atoms, while those at the cell centers are zinc
atoms. That such an arrangement corresponds to the formula CuZn is easily proved: since
one-eighth of each corner atom (copper) belongs to a given cell, and there are eight cor-
ner atoms, the corner atoms contribute one copper atom to each cell. Similarly, there is
one zinc atom at the center of each cell which belongs to this cell alone.
The transformation is indicated in the phase diagram by a single line running from
456°C to 468°C. Some work by Rhines and Newkirk has indicated that the band b/H11032ﬁelds
are separated by a normal two-phase ﬁeld ( b/H11001b/H11032), but the details of this region are still
not completely worked out, which is due primarily to experimental difﬁculties connected
with the rapidity of the transformation. The details of the transformation cannot be stud-
ied by quenching specimens from the two-phase region ( b/H11001b/H11032), since any normal

The two-dimensional phase diagrams discussed in the preceding sections cannot be used
to describe temperature-phase relations in alloys which contain three or more compo-
nents. As discussed in Sec. 10.9, there are three independent variables, or degrees of free-
dom, for binary alloys. By ﬁxing pressure for a given system, the remaining two variables
can be plotted in a two-dimensional space. For a three-component alloy system, on the
other hand, the number of independent variables is four (T, P, and two compositions). As
such, a three-dimensional construction is required to describe temperature and phase rela-
tions at constant pressure.
Ternary diagrams are commonly constructed by plotting the compositions along the
sides of an equilateral triangle base, called a Gibbs triangle, within which the composition
is represented by a point, as shown in Fig. 11.25. The corners of the triangle represent the
pure constituents, whereas its sides give compositions for the binary combinations. The
temperature for ternary diagrams is given along the vertical axis. As such, each side of this
three-dimensional structure represents one of the contributing binary phase diagrams. As
an example, a ternary phase diagram involving three binary eutectic alloys A-B, A-C, and
B-Cis shown in Fig. 11.26. There are three such curved liquidus surfaces for the ternaryFIG. 11.24 The unit cell of the b/H11032 phase of the

FIG. 11.26 A ternary phase diagram
with three eutectic binaries between A,
B, and C
shown in the ﬁgure, one of which is delineated by hatch lines. The intersections of the liq-
uidus surfaces form curved lines, called eutectic troughs , which eventually lead to the ter-
nary eutectic point E. The ternary eutectic point in this diagram represents the lowest
temperature at which a liquid will exist in the alloy at a predeﬁned constant pressure. It is
also the only point where four phases ( a, b, g, and liquid) are at equilibrium at the con-
stant pressure in which the diagram is drawn.
Utilization of the ternary diagram to determine the equilibrium phases in alloys is sim-
ilar to the process discussed in Sec. 11.2. To illustrate it, let’s consider a liquid alloy with
an overall composition given by point Xin Fig. 11.26. Upon cooling the liquid, the ﬁrst
solid will form when the temperature reaches the liquidus surface at point Y. The compo-
sition of this solid will be determined by a tie line that connects point Yto a corresponding
point on the solidus surface. (Note that these solidus surfaces are not shown in the ﬁgure,
only their intersections with the sides of the diagram can be seen.) Upon further cooling,
the liquid composition changes, following the contours of the liquidus surface, until it
reaches the eutectic trough at point Z. The liquid composition then moves down the
trough until the ternary eutectic Eis reached.
The solidus points in the ternary diagrams also form curved surfaces. This can be easily
surmised considering that each point on the liquidus surface is at equilibrium with a solid
on the solidus surface. The compositions of these phases are given by a horizontal tie line
connecting the two surfaces. Since drawing solidus surfaces and tie lines make the diagrams
rather complicated, ternary diagrams are often presented by a series of isothermal sections.
Each isothermal section represents a horizontal cross-section of the three-dimensional dia-
gram at a given temperature. Figure 11.27 shows three such isothermal sections for the ter-
nary diagram shown in Fig. 11.26. The ﬁrst section, Fig. 11.27A, is drawn at a temperature
below the A-B eutectic temperature but above the ternary eutectic temperature. A few tie
lines in the two-phase ﬁelds are indicated with dotted lines. Note that no tie lines are11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 344

necessary in a three-phase ﬁeld a/H11001b/H11001liquid since the composition of each phase is
uniquely deﬁned by the corresponding corner of the triangular region.
The isothermal section shown in Fig. 11.27B is drawn at a temperature below all
binary eutectic temperatures but above the ternary eutectic temperature. In this
temperature, only alloys with overall composition within the central triangle will be all
liquid, while those alloys poor in A, B, or Cwill be completely solid. All other composi-
tions will consist of a mixture of solid plus liquid. When the temperature falls below the
ternary eutectic, as shown in Fig. 11.27C, the alloy is completely solid, and it will contain
one, two, or three phases dependent upon the overall composition.
The isothermal sections can also be utilized to determine the fraction of phases
present in a ternary alloy by applying the lever rule discussed in Sec. 11.3. To illustrate11Ch11.qxd  11/6/08  6:39 PM  Page 345

this, consider an alloy with overall composition of 30 wt. % A, 15 wt. % B, and 55 wt.
% C, as shown by point zin Fig. 11.25. Let’s assume that the alloy contains two phases
aand bwith compositions given by points mand n, respectively. The fraction of the a
phase in the alloy is equal to the length of line zndivided by the length of line mn. The
fraction of the bphase would be zm/mn . A similar procedure can be used to determine
the phase fractions in alloys containing three phases. For this case, a triangle is ﬁrst
formed between the compositions of the three phases. In order to satisfy mass balance
for the components, the triangle will surround the overall alloy composition. An exam-
ple is shown in Fig. 11.25 for an alloy composition given by point Y, which is consid-
ered to contain three phases given by points p, q, and r. The line drawn from a corner
through yto point scan then be used to calculate the fractions.
The above-mentioned ternary diagram is a relatively simple one since it only deals
with three solid phases. The diagrams can become quite complicated if the binaries include
intermediate phases or other solid-state reactions. Examples of these systems can be found
in phase diagram handbooks or other similar sources.
For alloys which contain four or more components, the phase relations cannot be
described by a single diagram since more than a three-dimensional space would be
required. These alloys are generally described by multiple quasi-binary diagrams in which
the concentration of one component is changed at a time.

The ﬁeld of diffusion studies in metals is of great practical, as well as theoretical impor-
tance. By diffusion one means the movements of atoms within a solution. In general,
our interests lie in those atomic movements that occur in solid solutions. This chapterwill be devoted in particular to the study of diffusion in substitutional solid solutionsand the following chapter will be concerned with atomic movements in interstitial solidsolutions.
12.1 DIFFUSION IN AN IDEAL SOLUTION
Consider a solid solution composed of two forms of atoms Aand B,respectively. Let us
arbitrarily designate the Acomponent as the solute and the Bcomponent as the solvent,
and consider that the solution is ideal. This, of course, implies that there is no interactionbetween solute and solvent atoms or that the two forms act inside the crystal as thoughthey were a single chemical species.
Experimental work has shown that the atoms in face-centered cubic, body-centered
cubic, and hexagonal metals move about in the crystal lattice as a result of vacancymotion. Let it now be assumed that the jumps are entirely random; that is, the probabil-ity of jumping is the same for all of the atoms surrounding a given vacancy. This statementimplies that the jump rate does not depend on the concentration.
Figure 12.1 represents a single crystal bar composed of a solid solution of Aand Batoms
in which the composition of the solute varies continuously along the length of the bar, butis uniform over the cross-section. For the sake of simplifying the argument, the crystalstructure of the bar is assumed to be simple cubic with a /H20855100 /H20856direction along 
the axis of the bar. It is further assumed that the concentration is greatest at the right endof the bar and least at the left end, and that the macroscopic concentration gradient dn

of the plane of the paper. The exchange of Aatoms between two adjacent transverse atomic
planes, such as those designated Xand Yin Fig. 12.2, will now be considered. Of the six pos-
sible jumps that an Aatom can make in either of these planes, only one will carry it over to
the other indicated plane, so that the average frequency with which an Aatom jumps from
Xto Yis 1/6 τ. The number of these atoms that will jump per second from plane Xto plane Y
equals the total number of the atoms in plane Xtimes the average frequency with which an
atom jumps from plane Xto plane Y. The number of solute atoms in plane Xequals the num-
ber of solute atoms per unit volume (the concentration nA) times the volume of the atoms
in plane X, (Aa), so that the ﬂux of solute atoms from plane Xto plane Yis

The concentration of Aatoms in plane Ymay be written:
12.3
where nAis the concentration at plane X, and ais the lattice constant, or distance between
planes Xand Y. The rate at which Aatoms move from plane Yto Xis thus
12.4
where JY:Xrepresents the ﬂux of Aatoms from plane Yto plane X. Because the ﬂux of
solute atoms from right to left is not the same as that from left to right, there is a net ﬂux
(designated by the symbol J) which can be expressed mathematically as follows:
12.5
or
12.6
since the cross-sectional area was chosen to be a unit area. Notice that in Eq. 12.6, the ﬂux(J) of Aatoms is negative when the concentration gradient is positive (concentration of A
atoms increases from left to right in Fig. 12.2). This result is general for diffusion in an idealsolution; the diffusion ﬂux is down the concentration gradient. Notice that if one consid-ers the ﬂow of Batoms instead of Aatoms, the net ﬂux will be from left to right, in agree-
ment with a decreasing concentration of the Bcomponent as one moves from left to right.
Again, the ﬂux (in this case of Batoms) is down the concentration gradient.
Let us now make the substitution
12.7
in the equation for the net ﬂux, which gives:
12.8
This equation is identical with that ﬁrst proposed by Adolf Fick in 1855 on theoreticalgrounds for diffusion in solutions. In this equation, called Fick’s ﬁrst law, J is the ﬂux, or
quantity per second, of diffusing matter passing normally through a unit area under theaction of a concentration gradient dn
A/dx. The factor Dis known as the diffusivity , or the dif-
fusion coefﬁcient .
As originally conceived, the diffusivity Din Fick’s ﬁrst law was assumed to be constant
for measurements made at a ﬁxed temperature. However, only in the case of a solutioncomposed of two gases has it been veriﬁed experimentally that the diffusivity approachesa constant value at a ﬁxed temperature.

speed (4 to 1), the diffusivity ( D) changes by less than 5 percent when the atom fraction
n1/(n1/H11001n2) changes from 0.25 to 0.75. When the molecular masses are more nearly
equal, the variation in the diffusivity with composition becomes even smaller and harder
to detect in gaseous solutions.
In contrast to gaseous solutions, the diffusivity in both liquid and solid solutions is
seldom constant. An example of this variation of the diffusion coefﬁcient with composi-
tion can be seen in Fig. 12.3, taken from the work of Million and Kucera.1The ﬁgure
shows the variation of the diffusivity of cobalt in nickel-cobalt alloys at four different tem-
peratures. Ni and Co form an isomorphous phase diagram, similar to the one shown in
Fig. 11.1. In other words, Co and Ni form a single solid solution phase at all compositions
within the temperature range indicated in Fig. 12.3. It should be noted that a solid-state
transition form ato /H9255phase exists around 70 at. % Co in the alloys, but this transforma-
tion is at a much lower temperature than those indicated in Fig. 12.3. The measurements
show that at 1450°C, the diffusivity decreases linearly as cobalt content in the alloy is
increased. Actually, it decreases by a factor of about 4 as Co content changes from zero12Ch12.qxd  11/11/08  6:41 PM  Page 351

tent, but its variation is not linear. The data show none ideal behavior with two maxima
around 25 and 75 percent Co. Although the exact reason or reasons for the existence of
the maxima do not exist, they may be attributable to short-range ordering or clustering
in the alloys around these compositions. Based on the above results and similar measure-
ments done by other investigators,2it can be concluded that in metallic solid solutions,
the diffusivity is usually not constant and depends on the composition.
12.2 THE KIRKENDALL EFFECT
An experiment will now be discussed which shows that, in a binary solid solution, each of
the two atomic forms can move with a different velocity. In the original experiment, as per-
formed by Smigelskas and Kirkendall,3the diffusion of copper and zinc atoms was studied
in the composition range where zinc dissolves in copper and the alloy still retains the face-
centered cubic crystal structure characteristic of copper (alpha-brass range). Since their orig-
inal work, many other investigators have found similar results using a large number of
different binary alloys. Figure 12.4 is a schematic representation of a Kirkendall diffusion
couple: a three-dimensional view of a block of metal formed by welding together two met-
als of different compositions. In the plane of the weld, shown in the center of Fig. 12.4, a
number of ﬁne wires (usually of some refractory metal that will not dissolve in the alloy sys-
tem to be studied) are incorporated in the diffusion couple. These wires serve as markers
with which to study the diffusion process. For the sake of the argument, let us assume that
the metals separated by the plane of the weld are originally pure metal Aand pure metal B;
that on the right side of the weld is pure A, while that on the left is pure B. In order that a
total amount of diffusion, which is large enough to be experimentally measurable, can be
obtained in a specimen of this type, it is necessary that it be heated to a temperature close to
the melting point of the metals comprising the bar, and maintained there for a relatively long
time, usually of the order of days, for diffusion in solids is much slower than in gases or liq-
uids. Upon cooling the specimen to room temperature, it is placed in a lathe and thin layers
parallel to the weld interface are removed from the bar. Each layer is then analyzed chemi-
cally and the results plotted to give a curve showing the composition of the bar as a function
of distance along the bar. Such a curve is shown schematically in Fig. 12.5, from which it is
easily deduced that there has been a ﬂow of Batoms from the left side of the bar toward the
right, and a corresponding ﬂow of Aatoms in the other direction.
Curves such as those shown in Fig. 12.5 were obtained for diffusion couples many
years before the Smigelskas and Kirkendall experiment was performed. The original feature12Ch12.qxd  11/11/08  6:41 PM  Page 352

FIG. 12.6 Marker movement in a Kirkendall diffusion coupleto their work was the incorporation of marker wires between the members of the diffusion
couple. The interesting result which they obtained was that the wires moved during the dif-
fusion process. The nature of this movement is shown in Fig. 12.6, where the left ﬁgure
represents the diffusion couple before the isothermal treatment (anneal), and the right, the
same bar after diffusion has occurred. The latter ﬁgure shows that the wires have moved to
the right through the distance x. This distance, while small, is measurable, and for those
cases where the markers have been placed at the weld between two different metals, the
distance has been found to vary as the square root of the time during which the specimen
was maintained at the diffusion temperature.
The only way to explain the movement of the wires during the diffusion process
(in Fig. 12.6) is for the Aatoms to diffuse faster than the Batoms. In this present exam-
ple, it would be expected that more Aatoms than Batoms must pass through the cross-
section (deﬁned by the wires) per unit time, causing a net ﬂow of mass through the wires
from right to left. Measurement of the position of the wires with respect to one end of the
bar will show the movement of the wires.
The Kirkendall effect can be taken as a conﬁrmation of the vacancy mechanism of
diffusion. Through the years a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain
the movement of atoms in a crystal lattice. These can be grouped roughly into two clas-
siﬁcations: those involving the motion of a single atom at a time, and those involving
the cooperative movement of two or more atoms. As examples of the former, we have
diffusion by the vacancy mechanism and diffusion of interstitial atoms (such as carbon
in the iron lattice where the carbon atoms jump from one interstitial position to an adja-
cent one). While interstitial diffusion is recognized as the proper mechanism to explain100 percent B

FIG. 12.7 Direct inter-

mechanism for diffusionthe movement of small interstitial atoms through a crystal lattice, it is generally
conceded that a mechanism of diffusion which involves placing large atoms (which nor-
mally enter into substitutional solutions) into interstitial positions is not feasible on
energy considerations. The distortion of the lattice caused by placing one of these atoms
in an interstitial position is very large, requiring a very large activation energy. Of these
two possibilities based on the motion of individual atoms, the vacancy mechanism is
much to be preferred in explaining diffusion in substitutional solid solutions.
The simplest conceivable cooperative movement of atoms is a direct interchange, as is
illustrated schematically in Fig. 12.7. Here two adjacent atoms jump past each other and
exchange positions. However, this involves the outward displacement of the atoms sur-
rounding the jumping pair during the period of the transfer. Theoretical computations by
Huntington and Seitz of the energy required to make a direct intercharge indicated that it
is much larger than that required for the jump of an atom into a vacancy in metallic cop-
per, and it is commonly believed that this conclusion can be applied to other metals. For
this reason the direct interchange is usually ruled out as an important mechanism in the
diffusion of metals.
Another possible mechanism that explains diffusion in substitutional solid solutions is
the Zener ring mechanism. In this case, it is assumed that thermal vibrations are sufﬁcient
to cause a number of atoms, which form a natural ring in a crystal, to jump simultane-
ously and in synchronism in such a manner that each atom in the ring advances one posi-
tion around the ring. This mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 12.8, where a ring of four atoms
is shown and the arrows indicate the motion of the atoms during a jump. Zener has sug-
gested, on the basis of theoretical computations, that a ring of four atoms might be the pre-
ferred diffusion mechanism in body-centered cubic metals because their structure is more
open than that of close-packed metals (face-centered cubic and close-packed hexagonal).
The more open structure would require less lattice distortion during the jump. It has also
been proposed as a more probable mechanism than the direct interchange because the lat-
tice distortion that occurs during the jump is smaller, requiring less energy for the move-
ment. However, the principal objection to the acceptance of the ring mechanism, even in
body-centered cubic metals, is that it has been shown conclusively by diffusion experi-
ments involving couples composed of a number of different body-centered cubic metals,
that a Kirkendall effect occurs. It is possible to explain different rates for the diffusion of
two atoms Aand Bby a vacancy mechanism; the rate at which the two atoms jump into12Ch12.qxd  11/11/08  6:41 PM  Page 354
355 12.3 Pore Formation
the vacancies need only be different. In a ring mechanism, or in a direct exchange, the rate
at which Aatoms move from left to right must equal the rate at which Batoms move from
right to left. Thus, in those alloy systems where a Kirkendall effect has been observed, one
must rule out interchange mechanisms.
In summation, the vacancy mechanism is generally conceded to be the correct
mechanism for diffusion in face-centered cubic metals. First, because of the various
methods that have been proposed to explain the movements of atoms in this type of
crystal, it requires the least thermal energy to activate it. Second, the Kirkendall effect
has now been observed in a great many diffusion experiments involving couples com-
posed of face-centered cubic metals. In body-centered cubic metals, while calculations
have indicated that diffusion by a ring mechanism might require less thermal energy
than vacancy diffusion, the discovery of a Kirkendall effect in body-centered cubic
metals indicates that these metals also diffuse by a vacancy mechanism. Finally, while
the picture is not quite as clear in the case of hexagonal metals, results of diffusion
experiments are in accord with a vacancy mechanism. In this regard, it should be
mentioned that, due to the asymmetry of the hexagonal lattice, the rate of diffusion
is not the same in all directions through the lattice. Thus, diffusion in the basal plane
occurs at a different rate from diffusion in a direction perpendicular to the basal plane.
If a vacancy mechanism is assumed for hexagonal metals, this implies that the jump
rate of an atom into vacancies lying in the same basal plane as itself will differ from
the rate at which it jumps into vacancies lying in the basal planes directly above or
directly below it.
12.3 PORE FORMATION
The Kirkendall experiment demonstrates that the rate at which the two types of atoms of
a binary solution diffuse is not the same. Experimental measurements have shown that
the element with the lower melting point diffuses faster. Thus, in alpha-brass (a mixture
of copper and zinc atoms) zinc atoms move at the faster rate. On the other hand, diffusion
couples formed of copper and nickel show that copper moves faster than nickel, in agree-
ment with the fact that copper melts at a lower temperature than nickel.
In the case of a copper-nickel couple, shown schematically in Fig. 12.9, there is
a greater ﬂow of copper atoms toward the nickel side than nickel atoms toward the
copper side. The right-hand side of the specimen suffers a loss of mass because it loses
more atoms than it gains, while the left-hand side gains in mass. As a result of this mass

transfer, the right- and left-hand portions of the specimen shrink and expand respec-
tively. In cubic metals, these volume changes would be isotropic4except for the fact that
in a diffusion couple of any considerable size the diffusion zone containing the regionsthat undergo the volume changes may be only a small part of the total specimen.Shrinkage or expansion in a direction perpendicular to the weld interface occurs with-out an appreciable restraint from the rest of the specimen, but dimensional changes par-allel to the weld interface are resisted by the bulk of the metal that lies outside of thediffusion zone. The net effect of this restraining action is twofold: the dimensionalchanges are essentially one-dimensional (along the axis of the bar lying perpendicularto the weld interface) and a state of stress is set up in the diffusion zone. The region tothe right of the weld that suffers a loss of mass is placed under a two-dimensional ten-sile stress, while that on the side that gains mass is placed in a state of two-dimensionalcompressive stress. These stress ﬁelds may bring about plastic ﬂow, with the resultingstructural changes normally associated with plastic deformation and high temperatures,formation of substructures, recrystallization, and grain growth.
In addition to the effects mentioned in the previous paragraph, another phenome-
non is encountered when two diffusing atom forms move with greatly different ratesduring diffusion, and it is directly connected with the vacancy motion associated withdiffusion in metals. It has frequently been observed that voids, or pores, form in thatregion of the diffusion zone from which there is a ﬂow of mass. Since every time anatom makes a jump, a vacancy moves in the opposite direction, an unequal ﬂow in thetwo types of atoms must result in an equivalent ﬂow of vacancies in the reverse direc-tion to the net ﬂow of atoms. Thus, in the copper-nickel couple shown in Fig. 12.9, morecopper atoms leave the area just to the right of the weld interface than nickel atomsarrive to take their place, and a net ﬂow of vacancies occurs from the nickel-rich side ofthe bar toward the copper-rich side. This movement reduces the equilibrium number ofvacancies on the nickel-rich side of the diffusion range, while increasing it on the cop-per side. The degree of super-saturation and undersaturation is, however, believed to besmall. On the side of a diffusion couple that loses mass, it has been estimated by severalworkers
5,6that the vacancy supersaturation is of the order of 1 percent, or less, of the
equilibrium number of vacancies. Since the concentration of vacancies is not greatlyaffected by the conditions of ﬂow, and the number is, at best, a small fraction of thenumber of atoms, vacancies must be created on the side of a couple that gains mass, andabsorbed on the side that loses mass. Various sources and sinks have been proposed forthe maintenance of this ﬂux of vacancies. Grain boundaries and exterior surfaces areprobable positions for both the creation and elimination of vacancies, but it is now gen-erally agreed that the experimental facts agree best on the concept that the most impor-tant mechanism for the creation of vacancies is dislocation climb , and that dislocation
climb and void formation account for most of the absorbed vacancies, positive climbbeing associated with the removal of vacancies and negative climb with the creation ofvacancies.
The formation of voids, as a result of the vacancy current that accompanies the unequal
mass ﬂow in a diffusion couple, is inﬂuenced by several factors. It is generally believed thatvoids are heterogeneously nucleated, that is, they form on impurity particles. The tensilestress that exists in the region of the specimen where the voids form is also recognized as acontributing factor in the development of voids. If this tensile stress is counteracted by ahydrostatic compressive stress placed on the sample during the diffusion anneal, the voidscan be prevented from forming.12Ch12.qxd  11/11/08  6:41 PM  Page 356
357 12.4 Darken’s Equations
12.4 DARKEN’S EQUATIONS
The Kirkendall effect shows that in a diffusion couple composed of two metals, the atoms
of the components move at different rates, and the ﬂux of atoms through a cross-section
deﬁned by markers is not the same for both atom forms. It is, thus, more logical to think
in terms of two diffusivities DAand DBcorresponding to the movement of the Aand B
atoms, respectively. These quantities may be deﬁned by the following relationships.
12.9
where JAand JB/H11005the ﬂuxes (number of atoms per second passing through a unit 
cross-section area) of the Aand Batoms, respectively
DAand DB/H11005the diffusivities of the Aand Batoms
nAand nB/H11005the numbers of Aand Batoms per unit volume, respectively
The diffusivities DAand DBare known as the intrinsic diffusivities and are functions of
composition and therefore of position along a diffusion couple.
Darken’s equations,7which make it possible to determine the intrinsic diffusivities exper-
imentally, will now be derived. Several important assumptions are made in this derivation.
First, it is assumed that all of the volume expansion and contraction during diffusion, due to
unequal mass ﬂow, occurs only in the direction perpendicular to the weld interface. (The
cross-section area does not change during the diffusion.) As pointed out earlier, this condition
is effectively realized when the diffusion couple is large in size compared to the diffusion zone.
It is also assumed that the total number of atoms per unit volume is a constant or that
nA/H11001nB/H11005constant
This is equivalent to a requirement that the volume per atom be independent of concen-
tration, which is an assumption that has not been realized experimentally, but deviations
from this relationship can generally be compensated for by computation. The following
derivation is also based on the condition that porosity does not occur in the specimen
during the diffusion process.
Let us ﬁrst consider the velocity of the Kirkendall markers through space. In
Fig. 12.10, the cross-section at the distance xfrom the left end of a bar, with a square
cross-section of unit area, represents the position of the markers at the time t0, while the
cross-section at the distance x/H11032represents their position after a time interval dt. At
the same time the origin of coordinates (left end of the bar) is assumed to be far enoughJA/H11005/H11002 DA /H11128nA

away from the weld that its composition is not affected by the diffusion. The velocity v
of the Kirkendall markers may be written
12.10
The marker velocity is also equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the volume of
matter ﬂowing past the markers per second divided by the cross-section area Aof the bar
at the markers.
The volume of matter that ﬂows through the markers per second is equal to the net ﬂux of
atoms (net number of atoms per second) passing the wires times the volume per atom, or
where 1/( nA/H11001nB) is the volume per atom by the deﬁnition of nAand nB. The net ﬂux
equals the sum of the ﬂuxes of the Aand Batoms, or
12.11
Substituting the above expressions into the equation for the marker velocity gives us the
following equation:

along a diffusion couple. Equation 12.14 may therefore be used to compute the velocity
with which any lattice plane normal to the diffusion ﬂux moves. However, since DAand
DBare normally functions of composition, vis a function of the composition of the speci-
men at the cross-section where vis measured. This means that the value of vis normally
a function of position along the diffusion couple.
Equation 12.14 is one of our desired relationships, for it relates the two intrinsic dif-
fusivities to the marker velocity and the concentration gradient ( /H11128NA//H11128x), two quantities
that can be experimentally determined. However, another equation is also needed in
order that we may solve it and Eq. 12.14 simultaneously for the two unknowns DAand
DB. This needed equation can be obtained by considering the rate at which the number
of one of the atomic forms ( Aor B) changes inside a small-volume element.
Figure 12.11 also represents the diffusion couple of Fig. 12.10. In this case, however,
the (unit) cross-section (designated mm) at a distance xfrom the left end of the bar
represents a cross-section ﬁxed in space; that is, ﬁxed with respect to the end of the
bar, which is assumed outside of the diffusion zone. The cross-section at x (mm), accord-
ingly, is not an instantaneous position of the markers as was the case in Fig. 12.10. A
second (unit) cross-section of the bar ( nn) is also shown, the distance of which from the
end of the bar is x/H11001dx. The two cross-sections deﬁne a volume element 1 /H11080dx.
Let us consider the rate at which the number of Aatoms changes inside this vol-
ume. This quantity equals the difference in the number of Aatoms moving into and
out of the volume per second, or to the difference in the flux of Aatoms across the
surface at xand at x/H11001dx. Because a cross-section fixed in the lattice moves relative
to our cross-sections fixed in space (at xand x/H11001dx), the flux of Aatoms through one
of these space-fixed boundaries is due to two effects. First, because the metal is mov-
ing with a velocity v, a number ( nAv) of Aatoms is carried each second through the
cross-section at x, where nAis the number of Aatoms per unit volume, and vis the
volume of metal flowing past the cross-section at xin a second. To this flux must be
added the usual diffusion flux, so that the total number of atoms per second crossing
the boundary at xis:

The rate at which the number of atoms inside the volume dxchanges is therefore
or the rate at which the number of Aatoms per unit volume changes is
This equation may also be written:
12.15
because nA/H11001nBis assumed constant and the division of each term of the previous equa-
tion by this quantity makes it possible to convert concentration units from numbers of A
atoms per unit volume to atom fractions. The expression 12.14 is now substituted into 
Eq. 12.15, and with the aid of the relationship
NA/H110051/H11002NB
one obtains the ﬁnal relationship
12.16
This equation is in the form of Fick’s second law, which is generally written
12.17
where the quantity is seen to be equal to [ NBDA/H11001NADB]. In fact, it is just this relation-
ship that we have been seeking:

This is the second of Darken’s equations for the determination of the intrinsic diffusivitiesD

12.5 FICK’S SECOND LAW
Fick’s second law, Eq. 12.17, is the basic equation for the experimental study of isothermaldiffusion. Solutions of this second-order partial differential equation have been derivedcorresponding to the boundary conditions found in many types of diffusion samples. Mostmetallurgical specimens, such as the diffusion couple shown in Fig. 12.5, involve only a(net) one-dimensional ﬂow of atoms and the assumption that the specimen is long enoughin the direction of diffusion (so that the diffusion process does not change the compositionat the ends of the specimen). There are two standard methods of measuring the diffusioncoefﬁcient when using this type of specimen. In one case, the diffusivity is assumedD˜D˜D˜/H11128NA

constant, and in the other, it is taken as a function of composition. The former method,
known as the Grube method , is strictly applicable only to those cases in which the diffusivity
varies very slightly with composition. However, it may be applied to diffusion in alloysystems where the diffusivity varies moderately with composition if the two halves of a cou-ple are made of metals differing slightly in composition. Thus, the couple in Fig. 12.4, insteadof consisting of a bar of pure Awelded to another of pure B, might have consisted of an alloy
of perhaps 60 percent of Aand 40 percent of Bwelded to one of 55 percent of Aand 45 per-
cent of B. Our preceding analysis would hold just as well for this couple as for the couple
composed of pure metals. Over a small range of composition such as this, the diffusivity isessentially constant and the measurement effectively gives an average value of the diffusiv-ity for the interval.
If the diffusivity is assumed to be a constant, then Fick’s second law can be written
12.19
The solution of this equation for the case of a diffusion couple consisting originally of twoalloys of the elements Aand B, one having the composition N
A1(atom fraction) and the
other the composition NA2at the start of the diffusion process, is:
12.20
where NAis the composition or atom fraction at a distance x(in cm) from the weld
interface, tis the time in seconds, and is the diffusivity. The symbol erf rep-
resents the error function, or probability integral with the argument .This function is defined by the equation
12.21
and is tabulated in many mathematical tables
8in much the same manner as trigonomet-
ric and other frequently used functions. Table 12.1 gives a few values of the error functionfor some corresponding values of the argument y. In applying this table, the error function
becomes negative when is negative.
Figure 12.12 shows the theoretical penetration curve (distance versus composition
curve) obtained when the solution of Fick’s equation is plotted as a function of the vari-able , using the data of Table 12.1. Note that this curve is obtained under theassumption that is constant, or that varies only slightly within the composition inter-val N
A1to NA2(original compositions of the two halves of the diffusion couple).
The curve in Fig. 12.12 shows that, under the stated conditions, the concentration is a
single-valued function of the variable  . Thus, if a diffusion couple has been main-tained at some ﬁxed temperature for a given period of time ( t) so that diffusion can occur,
then a single determination of the composition at an arbitrary distance ( x) from the weld per-
mits the determination of the diffusivity . Thus, suppose that a diffusion couple is formedby the welding together of two alloys of the elements Aand Bhaving the compositions N
A1,
40 percent of element A(the alloy to the right of the weld), and NA2, 50 percent of element
A(left of the weld). Let the couple be heated quickly to some temperature T1and held there

363 12.6 The Matano Method
In general, the Grube method is based on the evaluation of the error function in terms of
the composition of the specimen at an arbitrary point and then, with the aid of the error-function table, the argument yis found. This, in turn, permits the value of the diffusivity
to be determined.
In the numerical computation just considered, a composition 42.5 percent Awas
assumed at a distance of 2 /H1100310
/H110023m from the weld when the diffusion time was 40 hr.
With the assumption of a constant diffusivity ( ) and the same diffusion temperature, letus compute the length of time needed to obtain the same composition, 42.5 percent A, at
twice the distance from the weld interface. Since the composition N
Aremains the same,
this problem requires that the argument of the probability integral has the same value asin the last example. That is,

Substituting these values into Eq. 12.22 and solving for t2gives a value for the latter of
160 hr. The equation x2

2t2is often used to indicate the relationship between
distance and time during isothermal diffusion even when is not a constant. In this lat-
ter case, it still serves as a rough but very convenient approximation.
12.6 THE MATANO METHOD
The second well-known method of analyzing experimental data from metallurgical diffu-sion samples was devised by Matano,
9who ﬁrst proposed it in 1933. It is based on a solu-
tion of Fick’s second law, originally proposed by Boltzmann in 1894. In this method, thediffusivity is assumed to be a function of concentration, which requires the solution ofFick’s second law in the form:
12.23
This mathematical operation is much more difﬁcult than when is constant and, as a con-sequence, the Matano-Boltzmann method of determining the diffusivity uses graphicalintegration. The ﬁrst step in this procedure, after the diffusion anneal and chemical analy-sis of the specimen, is to plot a curve of concentration versus distance along the bar meas-ured from a suitable point of reference, say from one end of the couple. For the purpose ofsimplifying the following discussion, it will be assumed that the number of atoms per unitvolume ( n
A/H11001nB) is constant. The second step is to determine that cross-section of the barD˜D˜/H11128NA

Area M

Matano interfaceFIG. 12.13 The Matano interface lies at the
position where area Mequals area Nthrough which there have been equal total ﬂuxes of the two atomic forms ( Aand B). This
cross-section is known as the Matano interface and lies at the position where areas Mand
Nin Fig. 12.13 are equal. The position of the Matano interface is determined by graphical
integration, but, in general, it has also been experimentally determined that, in the absence
of porosity, the Matano interface lies at the position of the original weld. (This is not the
position of the weld after diffusion has occurred since, as we have seen, markers placed at
the weld move during diffusion.) Once the Matano interface has been located, it serves as
the origin of the xcoordinate. In agreement with the normal sign convention, distances to
the right of the interface are considered positive, while those to the left of it are negative.
With the coordinate system thus deﬁned, the Boltzmann solution of Fick’s equation is
12.24
where tis the time of diffusion, NAis the concentration in atomic units at a distance x
measured from the Matano interface, and NA1is the concentration of one side of the
diffusion couple at a point well removed from the interface where the composition is
constant and not affected by the diffusion process.
In a manner similar to that used to explain the Grube method, we shall take arbitrar-
ily assumed diffusion data and solve them by the Matano method. Table 12.2 represents
this concentration-distance data corresponding to no actual alloy system, but it is repre-
sentative, in a broad general way, of diffusion data obtained in actual experiments. The dif-
fusion couple is assumed to be formed from pure Aand pure B.
Figure 12.14 shows the penetration curve obtained when the data of Table 12.2 are
plotted. Let us reconsider the Boltzmann solution of Fick’s second law:
12.25
Suppose that we desire to know the diffusivity at a particular concentration, which we
shall arbitrarily take as 0.375. This concentration corresponds to the point marked Cin
Fig. 12.14. In order to compute the diffusivity at this point, we must ﬁrst evaluate two
quantities with the aid of Fig. 12.14. The ﬁrst of these is the derivative /H11128x/H11128NA, the recip-
rocal of the slope of the penetration curve at point C. The tangent to the curve at this point
is shown in the ﬁgure as line Eand its slope is 610 m/H110021. The other quantity is the integral,
the integration limits of which are NA1/H110050 and NA/H110050.375. The indicated integral corre-
sponds to the cross-hatched area ( F) of Fig. 12.14. Evaluation of this area by a graphical
method (Simpson’s Rule) yields the value 4.66 /H1100310/H110024m. The diffusivity at the composi-
tion 0.375 is, accordingly,

Computations similar to the above may be made to determine the diffusivity ( NA) at
any concentration not too close to the terminal compositions ( NA/H110050 and NA/H110051). In any
case, the slope at the desired concentration and the area (between the penetration curve,
the vertical line representing the position of the Matano interface and within the compo-
sition limits zero to NA) must be determined. Since the desired area approaches zero as the
composition approaches one of the terminal compositions, the accuracy of the determina-
tion falls off as NAbecomes very close to either zero or one.
Figure 12.15 shows the variation of ( NA) with the concentration NAfor the data of
Fig. 12.14, as determined by computation at several compositions. Notice that large values
of are obtained as one approaches the concentration NA/H110051. There is also a minimum
in this curve in the middle of the concentration range. A diffusivity-concentration curve
of this form has been reported10,11for the diffusion of zirconium and uranium. However,
the curves of Fig. 12.3 are more typical of the diffusion data reported to data.
12.7 DETERMINATION OF THE INTRINSIC DIFFUSIVITIES
The determination of the intrinsic diffusivities will now be illustrated with the use of the
assumed data of Table 12.2. First we must derive an expression for the marker velocity v
in terms of the marker displacement and the time of diffusion t. Experimentally, it has
been determined that the markers move in such a manner that the ratio of their displace-
ment squared to the time of diffusion is a constant. Thus
where kis a constant. The marker velocity is, accordingly,

367 12.7 Determination of the Intrinsic Diffusivities
In Fig. 12.14, an arbitrarily assumed position of the marker interface is shown at a distance
x/H110050.0001 m from the Matano interface. The diffusion time ttaken for the data is 50 hr,
or 180,000 s. These numbers correspond to a marker velocity
At the position of the markers we also have NA/H110050.65 and NB/H110050.35 and
The value of Mis obtained from Fig. 12.15, while dNA/dxis the slope of the penetration
curve in Fig. 12.14 at the position of the markers, and NAand NBare the atom fractions
of Aand B, respectively, at the position of the markers. The above values can now be sub-
stituted into the Darken equations:
yielding
5.5/H1100310/H1100212/H110050.35 DA/H110010.65 DB
2.78/H1100310/H1100210/H11005(DA/H11002DB)244
The solution of this pair of simultaneous equations has as a result
DA/H110056.24/H1100310/H1100212
DB/H110055.10/H1100310/H1100212
These values tell us that the ﬂux of Aatoms through the marker interface from right to
left is approximately 1.2 times that of the ﬂux of Batoms moving from left to right.
The preceding section has demonstrated that it is possible to determine experimentally
the intrinsic diffusivities of a binary diffusion system ( DAand DB). These quantities are
valuable because they measure the speed with which the individual atomic forms move
during diffusion. However, there has been, to date, very little success in the developmentof a theory capable of predicting the numerical values of the intrinsic diffusivities startingfrom a consideration of atomic processes. While it is generally agreed that diffusion inmetallic substitutional solid solutions is the result of the movement of vacancies, the fac-tors that control jump rates into vacancies of the two different atomic forms are complexand not completely understood. Thus, in our previous derivation of Fick’s ﬁrst law, severalsimplifying assumptions were made that do not hold for real metallic substitutional solidsolutions. First, it was assumed that the solution was ideal, but, as we have seen, mostmetallic solutions are not ideal, and in a nonideal solution the diffusion rates are inﬂu-enced by a tendency for like atoms either to group together, or to avoid each other.Second, it was assumed that the rate of jumping was independent of composition, that is,v/H11005(DA/H11002DB)/H11128NA

whether the jump was made by an Aor a Batom. The assumption that the rate of jump-
ing is independent of the composition is certainly not true, as may be judged by the fact
that measured diffusivities vary widely with composition.
As discussed above, theoretical interpretation of substitutional diffusion is difﬁcult
because of the number of variables that must be considered. For this reason, the majoreffort in diffusion studies has been directed toward the investigation of diffusion in rela-tively simple systems that are more amenable to interpretation. In general, these consistof the study of diffusion in very dilute substitutional solid solutions or the study of diffu-sion using radioactive tracers.
12.8 SELF-DIFFUSION IN PURE METALS
In self-diffusion studies, one investigates the diffusion of a solute consisting of a radioac-tive isotope in a solvent that is a nonradioactive isotope of the same metal. In such a sys-tem, both atomic forms are identical except for the small mass difference between theisotopes. The principal effect of this mass difference is to cause the solute isotope to vibrateabout its rest point in the lattice with a frequency slightly different from that of the sol-vent isotope, giving the two isotopes a slightly different jump rate. This difference is easilycalculated because the vibration frequency is proportional to the reciprocal of the squareroot of the mass, and since the jump rate into vacancies is proportional to the vibrationfrequency, we have
12.27
where 1/
τand 1/ τ* are the jump-rate frequencies of normal and radioactive isotopes
respectively ( τand τ* are the mean times of stay of the respective atoms at lattice posi-
tions, and mand m* are the masses of the two isotopes [ m* radioactive]).
Except for the mass difference, solute and solvent are chemically identical and the
solid solution is truly ideal. Considerations of the effect of the departure of a solution fromideality may thus be neglected. Furthermore, the mass correction is usually small so that,to a good approximation, we may assume that the intrinsic diffusivity of the radioactiveisotope is the same as that of the nonradioactive isotope. When the intrinsic diffusivitiesare equal, the interdiffusion coefﬁcient equals the intrinsic diffusivities, as may be seen byconsidering the Darken equation:
/H11005NBDA/H11001NADB/H11005(NA/H11001NB)D/H11005D
where is the interdiffusion coefﬁcient, D/H11005DA/H11005DB, the intrinsic diffusivity of either
the radioactive or nonradioactive isotopes, and ( NA/H11001NB) is unity by the deﬁnition of
atom fractions. Because the intrinsic coefﬁcients do not depend on composition, it is alsotrue that the interdiffusion coefﬁcient does not depend on composition. Therefore exper-imental determinations of self-diffusivities may be made by using the simpler Grubemethod.
Because self-diffusion in pure metals occurs in an ideal solution and with a diffusivity
that is independent of concentration, experimentally determined self-diffusion coefﬁcientsof pure metals are usually of high accuracy. Furthermore, because the diffusion processoccurs in a relatively simple system, the measured diffusivities are capable of theoreticalinterpretation. The assumption made in our derivation of Fick’s ﬁrst law are those actuallyD˜D˜1

ple cubic system: that is,
where Dis the diffusivity, ais the lattice constant, and τthe mean time of stay of an atom

In the chapter on vacancies, it was shown (Eq. 7.45) that
where r
a, the number of jumps made per second by an atom in a pure metal crystal, is
identical to our quantity 1/ τ; Hfis the enthalpy change or work to form a mole of vacan-
cies; Hmis the enthalpy change or energy barrier that must be overcome to move a mole
of atoms into vacancies; Ris the universal gas constant (8.31 J/mol-K), and Tthe absolute
temperature in degrees Kelvin.
In the above expression, the coefﬁcient Amay be replaced by Znand the equation
rewritten in the form
12.31
where Zis the lattice coordination number and nthe lattice vibration frequency. This
relationship may be interpreted as follows. The jump rate of atoms into vacancies ( ra)
varies directly as (1) the number of atoms ( Z) that are next to a vacancy; (2) the fre-
quency ( v) or number of times per second that an atom moves toward a vacancy; (3) the
probability ( ) that an atom will have sufﬁcient energy to make a jump; (4) theconcentration of vacancies in the lattice ( ). Equation 12.31 neglects entropychanges associated with the formation and movement of vacancies and should be morecorrectly written:

the diffusion coefﬁcient. For the present, it sufﬁces to point out that considerable success hasbeen obtained in the theoretical interpretation of the various factors in this equation. Adetailed discussion, such as is necessary to treat these quantities adequately, is beyond ourscope and for this reason the reader is referred to advanced papers covering this subject.

12.9 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE DIFFUSION
COEFFICIENT
It has already been seen that the diffusion coefﬁcient is a function of composition. It is alsoa function of temperature. The nature of this temperature dependence is shown clearly inthe equation for the self-diffusion coefﬁcient stated in the previous section,
Suppose that we set
12.35
and
Q/H11005/H9004Hm/H11001/H9004Hf12.36
where D0and Qare constants since all the quantities from which they are formed are
effectively constant. The quantity Qis the activation energy of diffusion, and D0is
called the frequency factor . The self-diffusion coefficient may now be written in the sim-
plified form
D/H11005D0e/H11002Q/H20862RT12.37
In this form, the equation can be applied directly to the study of experimental data.
Taking the common logarithm {2.3 log10(x)/H11005ln(x)} of both sides of Eq. 12.37 gives us

371 12.9 Temperature Dependence of the Diffusion Coefﬁcient
This is an equation in the form
y/H11005mx/H11001b
where the dependent variable is log D, the independent variable 1 T, the ordinate inter-
cept log D0, and the slope /H11002Q(2.3 R).
In light of the above, it is evident that if logarithms of experimental values of a self-
diffusion coefﬁcient yield a straight line when plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute
temperature, then the data conform to the equation
D/H11005D0e/H11002Q/H20862RT12.39
The slope of the experimentally determined straight line determines the activationenergy Qsince m/H11005/H11002 Q/H208622.3Ror Q/H11005/H110022.3Rm. At the same time, the intercept of the
line with the ordinate designated by byields the frequency factor D
0, since b/H11005log D0
or D0/H1100510b.
The above method of determining experimental activation energies and fre-
quency factors can be illustrated with the use of some representive data given inTable 12.3.
The data of Table 12.3 are plotted in Fig. 12.16. The slope of the resulting straight line
is /H110028000, or

The preceding discussion has been concerned only with the temperature dependence
of self-diffusion coefﬁcients. However, experimentally determined values of chemical
interdiffusion coefﬁcients , and of their component intrinsic diffusivities DAand DB, also
show the same form of temperature dependence. Thus, speaking in general, all diffusion
coefﬁcients tend to follow an empirical activation law, so that we have for self-diffusion

Although the activation energy in the case of self-diffusion has a signiﬁcance capable
of explanation in terms of atomic processes, the meanings of the activation energies Q, QA,
and QBfor chemical diffusion when the solute concentration is high are vague and not
clearly understood, particularly when other extrinsic factors also contribute to the diffusion
process.14Therefore, except when the solute concentration is very low, these activation
energies should only be considered as empirical constants.
12.10 CHEMICAL DIFFUSION AT LOW-SOLUTE 
CONCENTRATION
The chemical interdiffusion coefﬁcient also assumes a simple form when the solute concen-
tration becomes very small, as can be seen by referring again to Darken’s equation, Eq. 12.18:

Suppose that component Bis taken as the solute. Let us assume that at all points in
the diffusion couple the concentration of Bis very low. Then
and
12.43
Thus, at very low solute concentrations, the chemical interdiffusion coefﬁcient approaches
the intrinsic diffusivity of the solute.
If the solute concentration is much smaller than the solubility limit, solute atoms can
be considered to be uniformly and widely dispersed throughout the lattice of the solvent.Considerations relative to the interaction between individual solute atoms can be neglectedand each solute atom assumed to have an equivalent set of surroundings. All neighbors ofeach solute atom will be solvent atoms. Under these conditions, it is possible to give a the-oretical interpretation to the frequency factor D
B0and the activation energy for diffusion QB.
In fact, for cubic crystals we can write an expression for DBthat is entirely equivalent to that
which we have previously derived for the self-diffusion coefﬁcient. See Eq. 12.34.
In this expression, nis the vibration frequency of the solute atom in the solvent lattice,

while the above expression has the same form as the self-diffusion equation, most of thequantities on the right-hand side of the equation have somewhat different meanings.

Table 12.4 contains experimental data for the diffusion of several different solutes

The chemical diffusion data shown in this table wereobtained with the use of diffusion couples consisting of a plate of pure nickel welded toanother composed of an alloy of nickel containing the indicated element in an amount ofthe order of 1 atomic percent. For the systems studied, these couples conform to the con-dition that the solute concentration be low.

Consider the diffusion couple shown in Fig. 12.17, consisting of two halves with the same
chemical composition, but with a fraction of the Batoms in the right-hand member
radioactive. If such a couple is heated and the atoms allowed to diffuse, there should be
no detectable change in chemical composition throughout the length of the bar. However,
there will be a redistribution of the radioactive atoms. This change in concentration of
tracer atoms along the axis of the bar can be determined in the following manner. After
the diffusion anneal, the specimen is placed in a lathe and thin layers of equal thickness
removed parallel to the weld interface. Measurement of the radioactive radiation intensity
from each set of lathe turnings indicates the concentration of the radioactive Batoms in
the corresponding layer. A plot of these intensity values as a function of position along the
bar is equivalent to a normal penetration curve. In a specimen of this type, one measures
the diffusion of Batoms in a homogeneous alloy of atoms Aand B. Since the specimen is
chemically homogeneous, the composition is everywhere the same and there can be no
variation of the diffusivity with composition, which means that the penetration curve can
be analyzed for the diffusivity by the Grube method. The diffusion coefﬁcient found in this
manner is like a self-diffusion coefﬁcient, but indicates the rate at which Batoms diffuse
in an alloy of Aand Batoms rather than in a matrix of pure Batoms.
In some binary systems it is possible to ﬁnd radioactive isotopes of both of the compo-
nent elements ( Aand B) which are suitable for use as tracers. When this is possible, meas-
urements of the tracer diffusion coefﬁcients for both elements can be made over the
complete range of solubility. It is customary to give these quantities the symbols D*Aand
D*B. (The tracer diffusivities are denoted by asterisks to differentiate them from the intrin-
sic diffusion coefﬁcients DAand DB.) The coefﬁcients D*Aand D*B, like the intrinsic diffusiv-
ities DAand DB, are functions of composition, which means that the rate of diffusion ofTABLE 12.4 Solute Diffusion in Dilute Nickel-Base

375 12.11 The Study of Chemical Diffusion Using Radioactive Tracers
either the Aor the Batoms in a homogeneous crystal containing both atomic forms is not
the same as it is in a pure metal of either component. We now have two different types of
diffusion coefﬁcients describing the diffusion process of the two atomic forms—tracer andintrinsic—in a substitutional solid solution. It is not unreasonable to wonder if they arerelated. A relationship does exist and was ﬁrst derived by Darken
7and has been fully
veriﬁed by experiment. According to Darken, the relationship between the intrinsic diffu-sivities and the self-diffusion coefﬁcients are:
12.45
where D
Aand DBare the intrinsic diffusion coefﬁcients, D*Aand D*Bare the tracer-diffusion
coefﬁcients, gAand gBare the activity coefﬁcients of the two components, and NAand NB
are the atom fractions of the two components. With the aid of the Gibbs-Duhem equation(a well-known physical chemistry relationship),
NA/H11128ln gA/H11005/H11002 NB/H11128ln gB12.46
and from the fact that /H11128NA/H11005/H11002 /H11128 NBwe have
12.47
The two factors that give the intrinsic diffusivities, when multiplied by the respectivetracer-diffusion coefﬁcients, are actually equal and it is customary to call this quantity thethermodynamic factor .
Let us consider the signiﬁcance of the thermodynamic factor. In an ideal solution, the
activity ( a
A) equals the concentration of the solution NA, and the activity coefﬁcient gA
(which is the ratio of these two quantities), is one. Since the logarithm of unity is zero, thethermodynamic factor becomes
and the intrinsic-diffusion coefﬁcient equals the tracer-diffusion coefﬁcient. The tracer-
diffusion coefﬁcient can thus be considered a measure of the rate at which atoms woulddiffuse in an ideal solution, and the thermodynamic factor can be considered a correctionthat takes into account the departure of the crystal from ideality.
It is possible to express the chemical diffusivity in terms of the tracer-diffusion coefﬁ-
cients, for by Darken’s equation, Eq. 12.18:

Figures 12.18 through 12.20 contain experimental data for gold-nickel diffusion at
1173 K. At this temperature, gold and nickel dissolve completely in each other and form
a completely soluble series of alloys. The signiﬁcance of this experimental information is
that it gives experimental conﬁrmation of the Darken relationships.
In Fig. 12.18, the tracer-diffusion coefﬁcients are plotted as a function of composition,
and the very large variation of D*Aand D*Bis apparent. Notice that the tracer-diffusion rate
of nickel atoms in pure gold is about 1000 times larger than nickel atoms in pure nickel.

the thermodynamic factor (Fig. 12.19), the other marked (observed) is obtained from
direct chemical-diffusion measurements using Matano analysis. Quite good agreement is
found between the calculated and observed curves. The slight divergence between the two

12.12 DIFFUSION ALONG GRAIN BOUNDARIES 
AND FREE SURFACES
Atom movements in solids are not restricted to the interiors of crystals. It is a well known
fact that diffusion processes also occur on the surfaces of metallic specimens and along the
boundaries between crystals. In order to reduce complexity, these two forms of diffusion
have purposely been neglected in our previous discussions.
Experimental measurements have shown that the surface and grain-boundary forms
of diffusion also obey activation, or Arhennius-type laws, so that it is possible to write their
temperature dependence in the form
12.50
where Dsand Dbare the surface and grain-boundary diffusivities, Ds0and Db0are con-
stants (frequency factors), and Qsand Qbare the experimental activation energies for
surface and grain-boundary diffusion.
Sufﬁcient evidence has been accumulated to conclude that diffusion is more rapid along
grain boundaries than in the interiors of crystals, and that free-surface diffusion rates are
larger than either of the other two. These observations are understandable because of the
progressively more open structure found at grain boundaries and on exterior surfaces. It is
quite reasonable that atom movements should occur most easily on free metallic surfaces,
with more difﬁculty in boundary regions, and least easily in the interior of crystals.
Because of the very rapid movements of atoms on free surfaces, surface diffusion plays
an important role in a large number of metallurgical phenomena. However, grain-
boundary diffusion is of more immediate concern because, in the average metallic speci-
men, the grain-boundary area is many times larger than the surface area. Furthermore,Db/H11005Db0e/H11002Qb/H20862RTDs/H11005Ds0e/H11002Qs/H20862RT12Ch12.qxd  11/11/08  6:41 PM  Page 377
Chapter 12 Diffusion in Substitutional Solid Solutions 378
grain boundaries form a network that passes through the entire specimen. It is this latter
property that often causes large errors to appear in the measurement of lattice, or volume
diffusion, coefﬁcients. When the diffusivity of a metal is measured with polycrystalline
samples, the results are usually representative of the combined effect of volume and grain-
boundary diffusion. What is obtained, therefore, is an apparent diffusivity, Dap, which may
not correspond to either the volume- or the grain-boundary-diffusion coefﬁcient. However,
under certain conditions, the grain-boundary component may be small, so that the appar-
ent diffusivity equals the volume diffusivity. On the other hand, if the conditions are right,
the grain-boundary component may be so large that the apparent diffusivity diverges con-
siderably from the lattice diffusivity. Let us investigate these conditions.
Diffusion in a polycrystalline specimen cannot be described as a simple summation of dif-
fusion through the crystals and along the boundaries. Diffusion in the boundaries tends to
progress more rapidly than diffusion through the crystals, but this effect is counteracted
because as the concentration of solute atoms builds up in the boundaries, a steady loss of
atoms occurs from the boundaries into the metal on either side of the boundary. The nature
of this process can be visualized with the aid of Fig. 12.21, which represents a diffusion couple
composed of two pure metals Aand B. Both halves of the couple are assumed to be polycrys-
talline, but, for the sake of convenience, grain boundaries are indicated only on the right side
of the couple. A number of short arrows are in the ﬁgure to represent the nature of the move-
ment of Aatoms into the Bmatrix. That group of parallel arrows perpendicular to the weld
interface represents the volume component of diffusion. Other arrows parallel to the grain
boundaries indicate the movement of atoms along boundaries, and a third set of arrows per-
pendicular to the boundaries represent the diffusion from the boundaries into the crystals.
In the usual diffusion experiment, one removes thin layers of metal parallel to the
weld interface (like that indicated in Fig. 12.21 by two vertical dashed lines separated by
the distance dx). These layers are chemically analyzed to obtain the penetration curve.
The concentration of Aatoms in the layer dxdepends on how many Aatoms reach this
layer by direct-volume diffusion, and how many reach the layer by the short-circuiting
grain-boundary paths. The problem is quite complex, but for a given ratio of the grain-
boundary and lattice diffusivities ( Db/H20862Dl), the relative number of Aatoms that reach
the layer dxby traveling along grain boundaries and by direct lattice diffusion is a func-
tion of the grain size. The smaller the grain size, the greater the total grain-boundary

area available for boundary diffusion and, therefore, the greater the importance of
boundaries in the diffusion process.
The importance of grain-boundary-diffusion phenomena in diffusion measurements
is also a function of temperature. In Fig. 12.22, two sets of self-diffusion data are plotted
for silver specimens: the one at the upper right for grain-boundary measurements and the
one at the lower left for lattice measurements (single-crystal specimens). Both groups of
points plot as straight lines on the log D/H110021/H20862TAbscoordinate system. For grain-boundary
self-diffusion the equation of the line is:
Db/H110052.5/H1100310/H110026e/H1100284,500 /H20862RT, m2/H20862s
For volume or lattice self-diffusion,
Dl/H1100589.5/H1100310/H110026e/H11002192,000 /H20862RT, m2/H20862s
Notice that in this example the activation energy for grain-boundary diffusion is only about
half that for volume diffusion. This fact is signiﬁcant for two reasons: ﬁrst, it emphasizes the
fact that diffusion is easier along grain boundaries and, second, it shows that grain-
boundary and volume diffusions have a different temperature dependence. Volume diffu-
sion, when compared with boundary diffusion, is more sensitive to temperature change.
Thus, as the temperature is raised, the rate of diffusion through the lattice increases more
rapidly than the rate of diffusion along the boundaries. Conversely, as the temperature is
lowered, the rate of diffusion along the boundaries decreases less rapidly. The net effect is
that at very high temperatures diffusion through the lattice tends to overpower the grain-
boundary component, but at low temperatures diffusion at the boundaries becomes more
and more important in determining the total, or apparent, diffusivity.
The above facts are illustrated in Fig. 12.23, where the curves of Fig. 12.22 are
redrawn as dashed lines, and another curve (solid line) is also shown that corresponds to
self-diffusion measurements made on ﬁne-grain polycrystalline silver specimens (grain
size 35 microns before diffusion anneal). This latter curve consists of two segments, one
part with the equation

for temperatures below about 973 K, and the other coinciding with the single-crystal, or
volume-diffusion, data for temperatures above about 973 K. It can be concluded that at
temperatures above this value the volume-diffusion component is overpowering in silver
specimens with a 35-micron grain size. Below this temperature, the grain-boundary com-
ponent is a factor in determining the measured diffusivity.
The above results have general implications: ( a) diffusivities determined with polycrys-
talline specimens are more liable to be representative of lattice diffusion if they are meas-
ured at high temperatures and ( b) the reliability of the data can be increased by controlling
the grain size of the specimens. The larger the grain size, the smaller the grain-boundary
contribution to the diffusivity. Thus, for accurate measurements of lattice diffusivities using
polycrystalline specimens, high temperatures and large-grained specimens should be used.
12.13 FICK’S FIRST LAW IN TERMS OF A MOBILITY 
AND AN EFFECTIVE FORCE
Fick’s ﬁrst law is often expressed by using a different set of variables. This form of the equa-
tion will now be developed by considering the diffusion of one component in an ideal
binary solution. Fick’s ﬁrst law, Eq. 12.8, in this case may be written
12.51
where JAis the number of Aatoms passing an interface of unit area per second, nAis the
number of Aatoms per unit volume, and D*Ais the diffusivity of Ain an ideal solution. Note
that this diffusion coefﬁcient is equivalent to that measured with radioactive tracers in a
solution of constant chemical composition (see Sec. 12.11). This expression may be reex-
pressed in the form
12.52
where J/H11032Aequals JA/H20862Aand represents the ﬂux of Aatoms per cm2, (nA/H11001nB)/H11003NAequals

Solving this expression for /H11128NA/H20862/H11128xand substituting the result into Fick’s equation and not-
ing that ( nA/H11001nB)NAequals nA(the number of atoms of Aper unit volume), gives us
12.53
Now let us make the substitution B/H11005D*ARTand we obtain the result

free energy of the Acomponent in the solution with respect to the distance x. Both /H11128A/H20862/H11128x
and Bhave a physical signiﬁcance worth noting. The partial-molal free energy Ahas the
dimensions of an energy, and its derivative with respect to the distance xcan be considered
as an effective “force” causing diffusion to occur in this direction. Bhas the dimensions of
velocity divided by force. In terms of its dimensions, Eq. 12.54 may be written
While the above relationship was derived for the special case of diffusion in an ideal
solution, the result is of general use and may be applied to diffusion in a nonideal solution
where the partial-molal free energy is given (see Eq. 10.27) by
A/H11005G°A/H11001RTln aA
where aAis the activity of the Acomponent in the solution. Let us now consider the deriv-
ative of this partial-molal free energy with respect to x, the distance along a diffusion cou-
ple. Since by the deﬁnition of the activity coefﬁcient gA(see Eq. 10.28), aA/H11005gANA, we have

12.14 DIFFUSION IN NON-ISOMORPHIC ALLOY SYSTEMS
When a thin sheet of copper is welded to a thin sheet of nickel and the diffusion couple
thus formed is annealed at an elevated temperature, the composition should vary across thecouple in a manner like that shown in Fig. 12.12. In other words, the composition shouldchange smoothly and continuously from pure nickel on the one side of the couple to purecopper on the other side. A penetration curve of this type is obtained when an alloy systemcontains only a single solid phase. The corresponding penetration curve in an alloy systemcontaining a number of different solid phases, such as the copper-zinc system, is basicallydifferent. For example, when a copper-zinc diffusion couple is annealed at a temperature ofthe order of 400°C, a layered structure is formed. Each layer in this couple corresponds toone of the ﬁve solid phases that can exist at this temperature. In order to explain the natureof such layered structures, a hypothetical alloy system will be considered whose phase dia-gram is shown in Fig. 12.24. This system has a single intermediate phase, the bphase, in
addition to the terminal aand gphases. A diffusion couple formed by welding a layer of
pure metal Ato a layer of pure metal B, after a diffusion anneal at a temperature T
1, can
show three distinct layers corresponding, respectively, to the a, b, and gphases, as shown
in Fig. 12.25. If the composition-distance curve is determined for this couple, it also shouldhave the form shown in Fig. 12.25. Note that where the penetration curve crosses either ofthe boundaries separating a pair of phases, there is a sharp discontinuity in the composi-tion. These sudden changes in composition are equal to the composition differences acrossthe two-phase a/H11001band b/H11001gﬁelds. Thus, consider the boundary between the alpha and
beta phases. Note that as the interface is approached from the alpha-phase side, the com-position curve, corresponding to the Bcomponent, rises to the point marked a. This point
represents the same composition as point ain the phase diagram of Fig. 12.24. On the other
side of the boundary, the composition in the beta phase is given by point b, corresponding
to point bon the phase diagram. Similarly, at the beta-gamma boundary, the composition
changes from cto d, corresponding to points cand don the phase diagram. In brief, the dif-
fusion couple in an alloy system of this type is like a constant temperature section cut acrossthe phase diagram in which each of the single-phase ﬁelds appears with a ﬁnite width, butin which the two-phase ﬁelds are represented by surfaces.J/H11032A/H11005/H11002/H208981/H11001NA/H11128 ln gA

Chapter 12 Diffusion in Substitutional Solid Solutions 384
The reason why the two-phase ﬁelds appear as surfaces in a diffusion couple is not hard
to understand. Two important factors need to be considered. First, for diffusion to occur, a
concentration gradient must exist across the couple. More accurately, an activity gradient has
to exist. If this gradient is missing at any position across the couple the ﬂux of Aor Batoms
past this position will stop. According to Eq. 10.27, we may write for the Bcomponent
/H9004B/H11005B/H11002G°B/H11005RTln aB12.56
where Bis the partial molal free energy of the Bcomponent, G°Bis the free energy per mole
of pure Bat the temperature in question, and aBis the activity of the Bcomponent. This
equation shows that at constant temperature a variation in aBwith distance across the cou-
ple corresponds to a variation in the partial-molal free energy with distance. Thus, contin-
uous diffusion across the couple can only occur if the partial-molal free energy decreases
continuously with distance. Now consider Fig. 12.26, which shows the hypothetical free
energy composition curves for the three phases, a, b, and g, at the temperature T1. As dis-
cussed earlier in Section 10.8, a line drawn so that it is tangent to a pair of these free-energy
curves deﬁnes the limits of a two-phase ﬁeld. This is indicated in Fig. 12.26. Also by 
Sec. 10.8, the intersection with the sides of the ﬁgure of a tangent drawn to any point on a
free-energy composition curve gives the partial-molal free energy of the phase in question.
By drawing a series of tangents to this set of three free-energy curves and selecting the min-
imum value of the partial-molal free energy corresponding to a given composition, it is pos-
sible to determine a curve corresponding to the variation of the partial-molal free energy of
the Bcomponent with composition across the whole phase diagram when the temperatureGG G

is T1. Such a curve is shown in Fig. 12.27. Note that starting with pure B, the partial-molal
free energy of the Bcomponent falls continuously with decreasing concentration of Buntil
the two-phase g/H11001bﬁeld is reached. In this region the partial-molal free energy, deﬁned
by the common tangent to the gamma and beta energy curves in Fig. 12.27, is constant and
equal to . A similar constant partial-molal free-energy interval is also obtained in the
alpha-beta two-phase region. Here the partial molal free energy is .
The signiﬁcance of the above can be easily stated. The only way that a gradient in the
partial-molal free energy can be obtained in an interval where the partial-molal free
energy wants to remain constant is for the thickness of the interval to vanish. In other
words, in the diffusion couple the two-phase regions have to appear as surfaces; that is,
regions of zero thickness. If this did not occur, there could be no net diffusion ﬂux across
the couple. Finally, note that by Fig. 12.27 the partial-molal free energy of the band g
phases are equal at the interface. While a composition difference exists at the boundary,
this is not true of the free energy. At the interface there is a change in slope of the partial-
molal free energy versus distance curve, but there is no discontinuity in B.
The width of the single-phase layers in a diffusion couple will now be considered
brieﬂy. It is quite possible for a phase or phases to appear to be missing in a diffusion cou-
ple. Thus, as shown by Bückle, when a diffusion couple is formed from copper and zinc and
annealed for about a half hour at 380°C, a layered structure, analogous to that shown
schematically in Fig. 12.28, is obtained. Note that the b/H11032phase layer is so thin that it is not
visible at a magniﬁcation of about 150 /H11003. The thickness of a diffusion layer is determined by
the relative velocities with which its two boundaries move. These boundary movements are
controlled by diffusion and are therefore analogous to the diffusion-controlled planar inter-
face growth phenomenon to be discussed in Sec. 15.7. As an example, we will now con-
sider the growth of the b-phase layer in Fig. 12.25. At the start of the anneal this layer has
a zero thickness. With time it should grow in size. However, its net growth depends on the
relative velocities with which its two boundaries move. The two boundaries will not nor-
mally move with the same velocity because the growth-controlling variables are not the
same at the two boundaries. By analogy with the planar growth equation developed in Sec.
15.7, we may write, with respect to the boundary between the beta and alpha phases,

The left-hand side of this equation corresponds to the number of Batoms required to move
the boundary through a distance , while the right-hand side represents the net ﬂux that
will give this number. As will be discussed in Sec. 15.7, the boundary is assumed to move
only as the result of carbon atoms diffusing into cementite. In this case one has to considerboth the ﬂux of Batoms up to the interface in the bphase, as well as the ﬂux of Batoms
away from the interface in the aphase. The Eq. 12.57 may be simpliﬁed to
12.58
and a corresponding growth velocity expression written for the bto ginterface,
12.59
Note that the growth velocities of the two interfaces of the bphase depend on a number
of parameters. These include the concentrations of the phases at the boundaries, the dif-fusion coefﬁcients, and the concentration gradients. Since the diffusion coefﬁcients arenormally functions of the composition, the solution of layer-growth problems is usuallyvery difﬁcult. Also, it is quite possible to conceive of growth conditions that will not allowa phase to develop a layer of visible thickness. In fact, by suitable choices of diffusion coef-ﬁcients, it is possible to make either boundary move in either direction.
The above analysis has assumed a condition of dynamic equilibrium and implies a diffu-
sion couple of such a size that its outer layers do not change their compositions. In a diffusioncouple of a ﬁnite size, the situation can be quite different. Thus, if in the above example thecopper and zinc layers were very thin and present in a ratio of 48 percent zinc to 52 percentcopper, a sufﬁciently long anneal should result in a specimen containing only a single phase.This would be the b/H11032phase, or the phase corresponding to the average composition.
A word should be said about some practical examples of layered structures. A typical
example is furnished by galvanized iron. When steel is dipped in molten zinc, the zinc diffusesinto the iron and a layered structure is formed that contains four phases in addition to the basemetal (steel). The outermost of these phases is a liquid. On cooling, this liquid passes throughan eutectic point so that the outermost layer is basically an eutectic. Hot-dipped tin plate alsohas a layered alloy structure. In fact, in most cases where one metal is plated on another underconditions where diffusion can occur, it will be found that layered structures tend to develop.dxgb

12.1 (a) What is the number of atoms in a cubic meter 
of copper? The gram-atomic weight of copper is 63.54 grams
per mole and the atomic volume of copper is 7.09 cm3per
gram-atom.
(b)Next, compute the number of copper atoms per m3
given that the lattice constant, a, of copper is 0.36153 nmand that there are 4 atoms per unit cell in a face-centered
cubic crystal.
12.2 A diffusion couple, made by welding a thin one-
centimeter square slab of pure metal Ato a similar slab of
pure metal B, was given a diffusion anneal at an elevated12Ch12.qxd  11/11/08  6:41 PM  Page 386

chemically analyzing successive layers of the specimen, cutparallel to the weld interface, it was observed that, at oneposition, over a distance of 5000 nm, the atom fraction of metal A, N
A, changed from 0.30 to 0.35. Assume
that the number of atoms per m3of both pure metals is 9

mine the number of Aatoms per second that would pass
through this cross-section at the annealing temperature.

formed by welding a thin plate of metal Ato a similar
plate of metal B, move with a velocity of 4.5 /H1100310/H1100212m/s
toward the Acomponent when the concentration  NA/H11005
0.38 and the concentration gradient, dnA/dx, is 2.5 /H11003102

the intrinsic diffusivities of the two components.
12.5 This problem and the next require an error func-
tion (probability integral) table. However, it is suggested
that one develop such a table using the following proce-dure. The error function is based upon integrating theexponential e
/H11002y2between the limits y/H110050 and y/H11005y. A
convenient way of doing this is to integrate the first sixterms of the series expansion for e
/H11002y2, which are

389In Chapter 12, the diffusion of atoms in substitutional solid solutions was considered. In
this chapter, we shall be concerned with diffusion in interstitial solid solutions. In the for-mer case, atoms move as a result of jumps into vacancies; in the present case, diffusionoccurs by solute atoms jumping from one interstitial site into a neighboring one. Interstitialdiffusion is basically simpler, since the presence of vacancies is not required for the soluteatoms to move. The following expression for the diffusivity of the solute atoms in a dilutesubstitutional solid solution was presented in Chapter 12
D/H11005aa2Zne/H11002(/H9004Gm/H11001/H9004Gf)/RT13.1
where ais the lattice parameter of the crystal, ais a geometrical factor that depends upon
the crystal, Zis the coordination number, nis the vibration frequency of a solute atom in a
substitutional site, /H9004Gfis the free-energy change per mole associated with the formation of
vacancies, and /H9004Gmis the free-energy per mole required for solute atoms to jump over their
energy barriers into vacancies. A similar expression can be written for interstitial diffusivity:
D/H11005aa2pne/H11002/H9004Gm/RT13.2
In this case, pis the number of nearest interstitial sites, aand ahave the same meanings
as above, vis the vibration frequency of a solute atom in an interstitial site, and /H9004Gmis the
free-energy per mole needed for solute atoms to jump between interstitial sites. Thisexpression, in contrast to the previous one, contains only one free-energy term: the directresult of the fact that interstitial diffusion is not dependent upon the presence of vacan-cies. Because a free-energy change is capable of being expressed in the form
/H9004G/H11005/H9004H/H11002T/H9004S 13.3
the expression for the interstitial diffusivity can be written:
D/H11005aa2pne/H11001/H9004Sm/Re/H11002/H9004Hm/RT13.4
where /H9004Smis the entropy change of the lattice (per mole solute atoms), and /H9004Hmis the
work (per mole of solute atoms) associated with bringing solute atoms to the saddle pointduring a jump between interstitial positions.
13.1 MEASUREMENT OF INTERSTITIAL DIFFUSIVITIES
Interstitial diffusion is often studied, especially when it occurs at high temperatures, with thesame experimental techniques (Matano, Grube, etc.) used for the study of diffusion insubstitutional solid solutions. On the other hand, a great deal of success has been achievedin the investigation of interstitial diffusion, especially in body-centered cubic metals, with

and Mehl, R. F., Trans. AIME , 188 553 [1950].)an entirely different technique. This technique has the advantage that it can be used at very
low temperatures where normal methods of studying diffusion are inoperative because of
very slow diffusion rates. The method will be discussed in the next section and considerable
time will be spent on it, not only because it is an important tool for the study of diffusion,
but also because the general ﬁeld of internal friction in metals is of importance in the study
of metallurgical phenomena. While space does not permit a discussion of the use of internal-
friction methods to areas other than the study of diffusion, an appreciation of the advantage
of this type of technique can be gained by investigating its application to diffusion studies.
Before taking up the subject of internal-friction measurements, it should be pointed
out that, as in the case of substitutional alloys, experimental measurements of interstitial-
diffusion coefﬁcients conform to an equation of the type
D/H11005D0e/H11002Q/RT13.5
where Dis the diffusivity or diffusion coefﬁcient, D0is a constant known as the frequency
factor, and Qis the experimental activation energy for diffusion. Comparison of this
expression with the theoretical one given in Eq. 13.5 shows that
Q/H11005/H9004Hmand D0/H11005aa2p/H9263e/H9004Sm/R13.6
Excellent agreement has been found between the quantities /H9004Hmand /H9004Sm(which may be
computed theoretically for basic atomic considerations) and the experimentally deter-
mined quantities Qand D0. When the diffusion takes place by a single mechanism, the
Arrhenius Plot of ln Dversus 1/ Tis linear, with a constant slope of /H11002Q/R. It is well to note,
however, that we are speaking of dilute interstitial solid solutions. When the concentra-
tion of the solute becomes appreciable, so that large numbers of interstitial sites are occu-
pied, solute atoms interact, or at least interfere, with each other’s jumps. As was found
to be the case in substitutional solid solutions, interstitial diffusivities are, in general,
functions of composition. For example, see Fig. 13.1.
As indicated earlier, most interstitial diffusion coefﬁcient measurements conform to
Eq. 13.5. However, there are other measurements involving interstitial diffusion in body-
centered cubic metals that show this not to be the case. An example is shown in Fig. 13.2
for diffusion of carbon in bcc iron. The temperature designated by Tcrepresents the Curie
temperature. In this Arrhenius plot, the diffusivity deviates from linearity toward faster
diffusion at high temperatures. Similar positive deviation from linearity have been13Ch13.qxd  11/6/08  3:51 PM  Page 390

oxygen in the group V metals molybdenum, niobium, vanadium, and tantalum. Such pos-
itive deviations in these bcc metals have been attributed to other factors contributing to
the overall diffusivity of the interstitials.1–7
13.2 THE SNOEK EFFECT
The study of interstitial diffusion by internal-friction methods usually makes use of an effect
ﬁrst explained by Snoek.8In a body-centered cubic metal like iron, interstitial atoms, such
as carbon or nitrogen, take positions either at the centers of the cube edges or at the cen-
ters of the cube faces (see Fig. 13.3). Both positions are crystallographically equivalent, as
may be deduced from Fig. 13.3. An interstitial atom at either xor wwould lie between two
iron atoms aligned in a /H20855100 /H20856direction (the iron atoms on either side of the wposition lie
at the center of the unit cell shown in the ﬁgure and the center of the next unit cell in front
of this cell [not shown in the ﬁgure]). It has been previously mentioned (Chapter 9,
Fig. 9.2B) that the space available for the solute atom between two iron atoms is smaller
than the diameter of the solute atom. The occupancy of one of these positions (such as that
designated by xin Fig. 13.3) by a solute atom pushes apart the two solvent atoms aand b.
An atom at xor wthus increases the length of the crystal in the [100] direction. Similarly,
an atom at yor zincreases the length of the crystal in the [010] or [001] directions.13Ch13.qxd  11/6/08  3:51 PM  Page 391
Chapter 13 Interstitial Diffusion 392
For the sake of convenience, let us deﬁne the axis of an interstitial site as that direc-
tion along which the solvent atoms (at either side of the interstitial site) are spread when
it is occupied by an interstitial solute atom.
When a body-centered cubic crystal containing interstitial atoms is in an unstressed
state, a statistically equal number of solute atoms will be found in the three types of sites,
the axes of which are parallel to the [100], [010], and [001] directions, respectively. Now,
if an external force is applied to the crystal so as to produce a state of tensile stress paral-
lel to the [100] axis, it will have the effect of straining the lattice in such a manner that
those sites with axes parallel to [100] will have their openings enlarged, while those with
axes normal to the stress ([010] and [001]) will have their openings diminished. The effect
of a stress, therefore, is to give the solute atoms a somewhat greater preference for inter-
stitial sites with axes that are parallel to the stress. After the application of the stress, the
number of solute atoms tends to increase in these preferred sites, so that an equal division
of solute atoms among the three types of sites ceases to exist.
When the applied stress is small, so that the elastic strain is small (order of 10/H110025or
smaller), the number of excess solute atoms per unit volume that eventually ﬁnd them-
selves in interstitial positions, with axes parallel to the tensile-stress axis, is directly pro-
portional to the stress. Thus,
/H9004np/H11005Ksn13.7
where /H9004npis the additional number of solute atoms in preferred positions, Kis a constant
of proportionality, and snis the tensile stress. Each of the additional solute atoms in one of
the preferred positions adds a small increment to the length of the specimen in the direc-
tion of the tensile stress. The total strain of the metal thus consists of two parts: the nor-
mal elastic strain, /H9255el, and the anelastic strain, /H9255an, which is caused by the movement of
solute atoms into sites with axes parallel to the stress axis

When a stress is suddenly applied, the elastic component of the stress can be consid-
ered to develop instantly. The anelastic strain, however, is time dependent and does not
appear instantly. The sudden application of a stress to a crystal places the solute atoms in aZ axis

FIG. 13.4 Relationship between elastic and
anelastic strains. (After A. S. Nowick, Reference 9.)nonequilibrium distribution, for equilibrium now corresponds to an excess of solute atoms,
/H9004np, in sites with axes parallel to the stress. The attainment of the equilibrium distribution
occurs as a result of the normal thermal movements of solute atoms. The net effect of the
stress is to cause a slightly greater number of jumps to go into the preferred positions than
come out of them. However, when equilibrium is attained, the number of jumps per sec-
ond into and out of the preferred positions will be the same. Obviously, the number of
excess atoms in preferred positions and the anelastic strain must both be a maximum at
equilibrium.
The rate at which the number of additional atoms in preferred interstitial sites grows
depends directly on the number of the excess sites that are still unoccupied at any instant.
The rate is greatest, therefore, at the instant that the stress is applied, because at this time
the number of excess atoms in preferred sites is zero. As time goes on, however, and the
number of excess atoms approaches its maximum value, the rate becomes progressively
smaller and smaller. As in all physical problems where the rate of change depends on the
number present, an exponential law can be expected to govern the time dependence of
the number of additional interstitial atoms. In the present case, this law is:
/H9004np/H11005/H9004np(max)[1/H11002e/H11002t/τs] 13.9
where /H9004npis the number of excess solute atoms at any instant, /H9004np(max)the maximum
number that may be attained under a given tensile stress, tis the time, and τsis a constant
known as relaxation time at constant stress.
Since the anelastic strain is directly proportional to the number of excess atoms in pre-
ferred sites, it can also be expressed by an exponential relation
/H9255an/H11005/H9255an(max)[1/H11002e/H11002t/τs] 13.10
where /H9255anand /H9255an(max)are the respective instantaneous and maximum (equilibrium
values) of the anelastic strain. The relationship between the elastic and anelastic strains is
shown in Fig. 13.4.
The effect of removing the stress after the anelastic strain has reached its maximum
value is also shown in Fig. 13.4. If the stress is suddenly removed, the elastic strain is
recovered instantly, while the anelastic component is time dependent. For the condition
of stress removal, the anelastic strain follows a law of the form:
/H9255an/H11005/H9255an(max)e/H11002t/τs 13.1113Ch13.qxd  11/6/08  3:51 PM  Page 393
Chapter 13 Interstitial Diffusion 394
where /H9255anis the anelastic strain at any instant, /H9255an(max)is the anelastic strain at the instant of
the removal of the stress, and tand τshave the same meanings as in the previous equations.
The signiﬁcance of τscan be seen if the time tis set equal to τsand then substituted
into Eq. 13.11
13.12
The relaxation time τsis thus the time that it takes the anelastic strain to fall to 1/ e
of its original value. If τsis large, the strain relaxes very slowly, and if τsis small,
the strain relaxes quickly. The rate at which the strain relaxes is consequently an
inverse function of the relaxation time. It is also an inverse function of the meantime of stay of an atom in an interstitial position 
τ, for small values of τcorrespond
to large jump rates, 1/ τ, and rapid strain relaxation. These two essentially different
time concepts (relaxation time and mean time of stay of an atom in an interstitialposition) are directly related and, in the case of the body-centered cubic lattice, itcan be shown that
13.13
This relationship will now be derived following Nowick.
9For this purpose, let us
rewrite the expression for the anelastic strain, Eq. 13.10:
/H9255an/H11005/H9255an(max)/H11002/H9255an(max)e/H11002t/τs 13.14
The derivative of this latter is
13.15
As stated earlier, this equation shows that the time rate of change of the anelasticstrain equals the difference between the maximum attainable anelastic strain (undera given applied stress) and the instantaneous value of the anelastic strain. A similarrelationship holds for /H9004n

where nx, ny, and nzare the numbers of carbon atoms per unit volume in x, y, and z
sites, respectively, and 1/ τxz, 1/τyz, 1/τzx, and 1/ τzyare the jump frequencies of the car-
bon atoms between the types of sites indicated by the subscripts. Thus, 1/ τxzis the jump
rate of a carbon atom from an xto a zsite, and 1/ τzxis the jump frequency in the oppo-
site direction.
Under an applied constant stress, the jump frequencies will be different from those
obtained when there is no stress. This is because a stress applied along the zaxis, as
assumed above, lowers the energy barrier for a jump into a zsite from an xor ysite,
while it raises the energy barrier for a jump of the reversed kind. This is indicated
schematically in Fig. 13.5 for the case of atoms jumping between xand zsites. Due to
the symmetry of the lattice, an identical curve would be obtained for interchanges
between yand zsites. Note that as a result of the applied stress, the energy level of the
xsite is higher by an amount uthan the energy level of the zsite. In effect, this makes
the energy barrier for a jump from an xto a zsite ( q/H11002u/2), and for a jump from a zto
an xsite ( q/H11001u/2). The jump frequency in the absence of a stress is

Phys. Rev ., 71553 [1947].)13.3 EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE RELAXATION TIME
If the relaxation time is very long (of the order of minutes to hours), it can be determined
by the elastic after-effect method. In this case, a stress is applied to a suitable specimen
and maintained until the anelastic component of the stress has effectively reached its
equilibrium value. This corresponds to a point such as ain Fig. 13.4. After this condition
has been reached, the stress is quickly removed and the strain measured as a function of
time. The data obtained correspond to the curve at the lower right-hand side of Fig. 13.4
from which the relaxation time can be obtained either by determining the time required
for the anelastic part of the strain to fall 1/ eof its value, or by more elaborate methods10
of handling the data.
The elastic after-effect method is not particularly suitable for use when the relax-
ation time is of the order of seconds instead of minutes. In this case, a convenient
and frequently used method for determining relaxation time makes use of a torsion
pendulum of the type11shown schematically in Fig. 13.6. The specimen, in the form
of a wire, is clamped into two pin vises; the upper one rigidly fixed in the apparatus,
the lower one connected to the inertia bar and free to rotate with it. Small iron blocks
are located at each end of the inertia bar in order to make possible a smooth release
of the pendulum when it is set into oscillation. In placing the pendulum in motion,
it is given an initial twist about its axis so that the iron blocks are brought into con-
tact with two small electromagnets that hold it in the twisted position until the cur-
rent is broken in the magnet circuit. When this is done, the pendulum is free to
oscillate. A mirror placed on the bar connecting the lower pin vise to the inertia bar
makes it possible to follow the oscillations of the pendulum when a light beam is
reflected from its surface onto a translucent scale. Figure 13.7 shows a typical trace
of the pendulum amplitude as a function of time. Note that the amplitude decreases
with increasing time because of vibrational energy losses inside the wire (neglecting
air-friction effects on the torsion bar). Such an energy loss is said to be due to inter-
nal friction in the metal. There are many sources of internal friction in metals. We
are interested in that due to the presence of interstitial solute atoms in body-centered
cubic metals.
Three possible cases will be considered. First, let us assume that the period of the tor-
sion pendulum is very small compared with the relaxation time of the metal. In this case,
the length of time during a cycle that the wire is subject to a given type of stress is very13Ch13.qxd  11/6/08  3:51 PM  Page 398

FIG. 13.7 Damped vibration of a torsion pendulum
much shorter than the mean time of stay of a solute atom in an interstitial position. Stated
slightly differently, the stress alternates so rapidly that it is impossible for the solute atoms
to follow the stress changes. The anelastic component of the strain can be taken as zero
and the pendulum considered to vibrate in a completely elastic manner. A stress-strain dia-
gram for this case (Fig. 13.8) is a straight line with a slope equal to the modulus of 
elasticity. In anelastic work this slope is normally designated as MUand is called the unre-
laxed modulus . The line is drawn so that it passes through the origin of coordinates, in
agreement with the fact that a pendulum oscillates to either side of its rest point. The curve
of Fig. 13.8 can also be considered to represent the stress-strain diagram for a complete
oscillation of the stress.
The second possibility corresponds to the other extreme where the period of the pen-
dulum is very much larger than the relaxation time. In this case, the solute atoms have no
difﬁculty in following the stress alternations and it can be assumed that a state of equilib-
rium is constantly maintained. At all times, the anelastic strain will have its maximum, or
equilibrium, value corresponding to the instantaneous value of the stress. Both the anelas-
tic and elastic components of the strain vary directly as the stress and, therefore, the total
strain varies linearly with the stress. However, in contrast to the case where the period of
the pendulum is very short, the strain at each value of the stress will now be of greater

magnitude due to the ﬁnite value of the anelastic strain. Figure 13.8B shows that the
stress-strain curve for this second case has a smaller slope than the previous one, signify-ing that the modulus of elasticity (ratio of stress to strain) is smaller. The modulus of elas-ticity, measured under these conditions, is known as the relaxed modulus and is given the
symbol M
R.
The third case is the intermediate one where the period of the torsion pendulum
approximately equals the relaxation time. Here the stress cycles are slow enough thatthe anelastic strain assumes ﬁnite values, but the stress variation is not slow enough fora state of equilibrium to be effectively reached. Under these conditions, the anelasticstrain does not vary linearly with the stress, and the total strain contains a nonlinearcomponent (anelastic part). The stress-strain curve for a complete cycle of stress nowassumes the form of an ellipse (Fig. 13.8C) with the major axis lying between the linescorresponding to the stress-strain curves for very short and very long periods. The areainside this ( hysteresis ) loop has the dimensions of work and represents the energy lost
in the specimen per unit volume during a complete cycle. In the two other examples(Figs. 13.8A and 13.8B), the area inside the stress-strain loop is zero. It appears, there-fore, that the energy loss per cycle is a function of the period of oscillation, having a zerovalue when the period is either very long or very short, and a ﬁnite value when theperiod has intermediate values.
The energy loss per cycle in a torsion pendulum can be determined directly from a plot
of the pendulum amplitude as a function of time. In Fig. 13.7, A
1and A2represent two adja-
cent vibration amplitudes and the assumption is made that the difference in the magnitudeof these two amplitudes is small, a condition usually met in work of the type being discussed.
Now in an oscillating system, the energy of vibration is proportional to the square of
the vibration amplitude, so that the vibrational energy, when the pendulum has amplitudeA
1, is proportional to A2
1, and when it has the amplitude A2, the energy corresponds to A2
2,
and the fractional loss of energy per cycle is
13.36
where Eis the energy of the pendulum, /H9004Eis the loss of energy during a cycle, and A1and
A2are the amplitudes at the beginning and end of the cycle.
Factoring the expression on the right-hand side of Eq. 13.36 leads to
but since it has been assumed that the difference between A1and A2is small, we can write
A1/H11002A2/H11005/H9004Aand A1/H11001A2/H110052A1. Therefore,
13.37
This equation states that the fractional energy loss per cycle is twice the fractional ampli-tude loss per cycle. This latter quantity is easily determined experimentally.
The measure of the internal friction given above, /H9004E/E, is usually known as the speciﬁc
damping capacity . This quantity is often used by engineers to express the energy-absorbing
properties of materials of construction./H9004E

401 13.3 Experimental Determination of the Relaxation Time
A more commonly used measure of the internal friction in problems of the type cur-
rently being discussed is the logarithmic decrement , which is the natural logarithm of the
ratio of successive amplitudes of vibration. Thus,
13.38
where dis the logarithmic decrement, and A1and A2are two successive vibration amplitudes.
Provided that the damping is small, we may write10
13.39
Still another method of expressing the internal friction in a metal undergoing cyclic strain
uses the phase angle aby which the strain lags behind the stress. The tangent of this angle
can also be taken as an index of the internal-energy loss. Again, if the damping is small,10
it can be shown that
13.40
This quantity, tan a, is often written as Q/H110021and called the internal friction . This is in anal-
ogy with the damping, or energy loss, in an electrical system.
The energy loss per cycle /H9004E/Eis a smoothly varying function of the period, or fre-
quency, of the pendulum capable of being stated mathematically. When expressed interms of the angular frequency of the pendulum v
13.41

The relaxation time τR, as measured using a torsion pendulum, is not exactly the same
as τs, the relaxation time as measured in an elastic after-effect experiment, or other exper-
iments carried out at constant stress. The two quantities are, however, simply related to
each other by the expression10

where MRis the relaxed modulus and MUis the unrelaxed modulus. In the case of the
interstitial diffusion of carbon in alpha iron, MRand MUare very nearly equal, so we may
assume τR/H11005τsand also that the mean time of stay of a carbon atom in an interstitial site
is τ/H11005τR.
Equation 13.43 is symmetrical in both vand τR, so that the variation of the fractional
energy loss /H9004E/Eor dis the same no matter whether we hold τRconstant and vary vor
hold vconstant and vary τR. In either case, the given function yields a curve symmetrical
with respect to the point of maximum-energy loss, if dis plotted as a function of the log v,
or of the log τR. Figure 13.9 shows the shape of this curve and, as indicated in the ﬁgure,
the maximum logarithmic decrement occurs when the following relationship holds:
13.44
Equation 13.44 states that the energy loss is a maximum when the angular frequency
of the pendulum equals the reciprocal of the relaxation time. This fact is important because
it gives a direct relationship between the experimentally measurable frequency of the pen-
dulum and the relaxation time.
The relaxation time is only a function of temperature, while the frequency of the pen-
dulum is a function of its geometry. In theory, there are two basic methods of determining
the point of maximum energy loss: the frequency of the pendulum may be varied while the
temperature is maintained constant (thereby keeping the relaxation-time constant) or the
frequency of the pendulum may be kept constant while the temperature is varied. The lat-
ter method is more often used as it is usually more convenient. In this case we have

Solving this equation for relaxation time yields:

13.4 EXPERIMENTAL DATA
A compilation of certain experimentally determined interstitial-diffusivity equations is
given in Table 13.2. The value given in the table for the diffusion of carbon in iron is notthe same as that given above, for it is a later and somewhat more accurate value. In gen-eral, it is noted that in the elements listed, the activation energies of interstitial diffusionare somewhat smaller than those of substitutional diffusion.
13.5 ANELASTIC MEASUREMENTS AT CONSTANT STRAIN
In addition to measurements made at constant stress, as exempliﬁed by the techniqueof the elastic after-effect (zero stress) and vibrational studies, of which the torsionpendulum is only one of a number of techniques, there is a third basic type of meas-urement. This involves the measurement of the relaxation of the stress under the con-dition of a constant strain. In a typical experiment of this type, a specimen may beloaded in a universal (constant deformation rate) testing machine to some predeter-mined stress, whereupon the machine is stopped. Because the specimen is subjected toa stress, it continues to deform anelastically. For the purpose of this discussion it willbe assumed that the testing machine and its grips are very hard elastically. Under this
assumption, the ends of the specimen will be ﬁxed in space so that the total strain inthe specimen is constant, or
/H9255/H11005/H9255an/H11001/H9255el/H110050 13.51
Thus as the specimen increases its length anelastically there must be a correspon-ding decrease in its elastic strain. This will, of course, relax the stress in the speci-men in a manner like that shown schematically in Fig. 13.12. This curve is similarin its general form to the elastic after-effect curve and follows a similar law. It is,accordingly, possible to measure a relaxation time at constant strain, designated 
τ/H9255.
It is not the same as τs, the relaxation time at constant stress, but it is related to it
by the equation

PROBLEMS
13.1 For interstitial diffusion in a body-centered cubic
lattice, prove that a, in the diffusion equation D/H11005aa2/τ,
equals 1/24.
13.2 (a) Determine the mean time of stay of an oxygen
atom in an interstitial site in niobium at 300 K. See Table
13.2 for the necessary diffusion parameters and take the
lattice parameter, a, for niobium as 0.3301 nm.
(b) Do the same for a temperature of 400 K.
13.3 In a special torsion pendulum used for elastic after-
effect measurements, it is not practical to measure the
relaxation time if it is less than 1 minute. On this basis,
determine the maximum temperature at which the
apparatus should be used for determining the relaxation
time of nitrogen atoms in iron. Take a/H110050.28664 nm
and see Table 13.2 for the diffusion equation of iron.
13.4 Compare the relaxation times, τs, of vanadium and
tantalum, due to the presence of oxygen atoms in solid
solution, at 400 K. The lattice parameters of vanadium
and tantalum are, respectively, equal to 0.3029 and
0.3303 nm.13.5 (a) Determine the mean time of stay, τ, of a nitrogen
atom in a tantalum interstitial site at 400 K.
(b) At what temperature would τequal 1.0 second?
13.6 A torsion pendulum with a tantalum wire has a pen-
dulum frequency, n, of 0.82 Hz. When the logarithmic
decrement, d, is measured with this pendulum, 
the peak in the plot of dversus 1/ Toccurs at 415.5 K.
Show by using Eq. 13.45, with T/H11005415.5 K, that this peak
corresponds to the presence of oxygen in the tantalum.
13.7 A torsion pendulum with a vanadium wire contain-
ing nitrogen and a period of 2.00 seconds shows a
decrease in the pendulum amplitude, A, of 10 percent in
100 cycles of oscillation at 350 K. Compute:
(a) The speciﬁc damping capacity.
(b) The logarithmic decrement.
(c) Tan a, where ais the phase angle by which the strain
lags the stress.
13.8 Write a computer program suitable for obtaining
data to make a plot of the logarithmic decrement, d,where MUis the unrelaxed modulus and MRis the relaxed modulus. Both of these relax-
ation times are related to that obtained in a torsion pendulum as follows16
τR/H11005(τsτ/H9255)1/213.53
This shows that τR, obtained in a torsion pendulum, is the geometric mean of the other
two relaxation times.13Ch13.qxd  11/6/08  3:51 PM  Page 406

408Most commercial metal objects are frozen from a liquid phase into either their ﬁnal shapes,
called castings , or intermediate forms, called ingots , which are then worked into the ﬁnal
product. A large number of metal objects are also made by hot pressing and sintering ofalloy particles, which are produced via liquid-solid transformation. Since the properties ofthe end result are determined, in large measure, by the nature of the solidiﬁcation process,the factors involved in the transformation from liquid to solid are of the utmost practicalimportance. Before the subject of solidiﬁcation is considered, however, the nature of theliquid state will be treated brieﬂy.
14.1 THE LIQUID PHASE
For most cases of practical importance, liquid metal alloys occur as a single homogeneousliquid phase. To simplify the present discussion, we shall treat a special case—a pure metal-lic element with only a single solid phase. Figure 14.1 is a schematic phase diagram of asingle-component system.
From what we have previously learned, we know that the solid is a crystalline phase
in which the atoms are aligned in space in deﬁnite patterns over long distances. The reg-ularity of crystal lattices makes it easy to study their structures with the aid of X-ray dif-fraction and electron microscopy; therefore, a great deal is known about the internalarrangements of atoms in metal crystals. At the same time, the uniformity of the structureof crystals makes it possible to employ mathematics in the study of their properties. On theother hand, the gas phase represents the other extreme from the solid phase wherethe structure is one of almost complete randomness, or disorder, instead of almost com-plete order. Here, in most cases, the atoms can be assumed to be removed far enough fromeach other that metallic gases can be treated as ideal gases. The physical properties ofmetallic gases, like those of metallic solids, are therefore capable of mathematical analysis.
While the solid crystalline phase is pictured as a completely ordered arrangement of
atoms (neglecting defects such as dislocations and vacancies) and the gas phase as a stateof random disorder (ideal gas), no simple picture has as yet been devised to represent thestructure of the liquid phase. The principal trouble is the difﬁculty of the problem. Theliquid phase possesses neither the long-range order of the solid nor the lack of interactionbetween atoms characteristic of the gas phase. It is, therefore, essentially an indeterminantstructure. Actually, in a liquid, the average separation between atoms is very close to thatin the solid. This fact is shown by the small change in density on melting, which for close-packed metals amounts to 2 to 6 percent only, where part of this density change isprobably associated with the formation of additional structural defects in the liquid phase.A compilation of physical properties of pure metals at elevated temperatures and those ofliquid metals can be found in Reference 1. Further, the latent heat of fusion released

409 14.1 The Liquid Phase
when a metal melts is relatively small, being only to of the latent heat of vaporiza-
tion. Since the latter is a measure of the energy required to place the atoms in the gas
phase, where it can be assumed that they are so far apart that they do not interact, it serves
as a good measure of the energy binding atoms together. Both the small size of the energy
released when a metal melts and the fact that the atoms in the liquid and solid phases have
almost identical separations lead to the conclusion that the bonding of atoms in the solid
and liquid phases are probably similar. X-ray diffraction studies of liquid metals tend to
conﬁrm this assumption. Time does not permit us to delve into X-ray-diffraction tech-
niques as applied to liquid metals, but the results of these investigations are interpreted as
showing the following: liquid metals possess a structure in which the atoms, over short
distances, are arranged in an ordered fashion and have a coordination number approxi-
mately the same as the solid. The X-ray results also show that liquid metals do not possess
long-range order. A plausible picture of the liquid structure might be the following: the
atoms over short distances approach arrangements close to those exhibited in crystals, but
due to the presence of many structural defects, the exact nature of which is unknown, the
long-range order typical of a crystal cannot be achieved. In a number of cases, it has been
suggested that the liquid phase is essentially the same as that of the solid, with the incor-
poration into the structure of a large number of structure defects, such as vacancies, inter-
stitial atoms, or dislocations. However, these models have not been completely satisfactory
and it must be admitted that the exact nature of the defects that exist in the liquid phase
are not known. The fact that the atoms in the liquid have an extremely high mobility mod-
iﬁes this essentially static picture of the liquid phase. Diffusion measurements of liquids,
made at temperatures just above the melting point, show that atomic movements in liq-
uids are several orders of magnitude2(several powers of 10) more rapid than in solids just
below the melting point. The rapid diffusion rates in liquids are undoubtedly a result of
structural defects characteristic in the liquid phase. Since the nature of the liquid state is
unresolved, a simple picture of the way atoms move in a liquid cannot be presented. This
is in contrast to solids, where the evidence strongly favors the vacancy-motion concept.
One thing is clear, however: the energy barriers for atom movements in liquid diffusion
are very small. Since diffusion in the liquid state must be associated with a corresponding
motion of structural defects and the motion is very rapid, we are led to the conclusion
that the liquid phase is one of everchanging structure. The local order existing at any one1

position in space changes continually with time. This represents a basic difference between
liquid and solid phases. In a solid, diffusion by vacancy movement does not, in general,alter the structure of the crystal, whereas in the liquid the local structure is one of constantchange resulting from atomic motion. Another important consequence of the ease of atommovements in the liquid phase is the development of the property that is most character-istic of the liquid phase: ﬂuidity, or the inability of a liquid to support shear stresses of evenvery low magnitudes.
A surprising fact is that the liquid phases of most metals are very similar in their prop-
erties, even though their properties may be quite different in the solid state.
3Thus, on
melting, the close-packed metals are inclined to lower their coordination slightly, but met-als of loose packing, such as gallium and bismuth, usually increase their coordination. Theultimate result is that liquid metals tend to have the same number of nearest neighbors.The recent X-ray analysis shows that 8–11 nearest neighbors surround each atom in a liq-uid.
4The analysis further shows that a metallic liquid consists of clusters of atoms which
have crystal-like structure. The clusters are in turn surrounded by free atoms and free elec-trons. Various behavior of metals, such as heat capacity, heat of fusion, and diffusion, canbe explained based on the assumption that clusters rotate around the center of their mass.Similarly, the electrical and thermal conductivities of the liquid phases of metals also tendtoward common values.
The above facts may be interpreted as demonstrating that the properties of the liquid
phases of metals are more dependent on the structural defects characteristic of liquids thanthey are upon the nature of the bonding forces between the atoms. On the other hand, insolid crystalline phases, the physical properties are very dependent on the nature of thebonding forces between atoms, since these interatomic forces determine the types of crys-tals that form and, as a consequence, the properties of the solids.
From the standpoint of the free energy of the phases and the reasons for the existences
of transformations between solid, liquid, and gases, consider the following. Of the threephases, the solid crystalline phase possesses the lowest internal energy and the highestdegree of order or lowest entropy. The liquid represents a phase with a slightly higherinternal energy as measured by the heat of fusion, and a slightly larger entropy correspon-ding to its more random structure. Finally, the gas phase has the highest internal energyand the greatest entropy or disorder. The free-energy curves for these three phases may beplotted in a manner similar to those for the two solid phases of tin and, in each case, theslope will be steeper, in a more negative sense, the greater the inherent entropy of thephase. Thus, the free energy of the gas phase falls most rapidly with increasing tempera-ture, the liquid phase next, and the solid phase least rapidly. The free energies of the threephases are also functions of the pressure, so that their positions relative to each other arenot the same at different pressures. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 14.3, where the free-energy curves are drawn schematically for three isobaric lines (constant pressure) aa, bb ,
and ccof Fig. 14.2, which is based on Fig. 14.1. In the left-hand ﬁgure, corresponding to
the isobaric aa, it can be seen that at temperatures below the melting point, T
m, the solid
phase has the lowest free energy, but at Tmthe free-energy curve of the liquid phase
crosses that of the solid, and the liquid phase becomes the more stable until Tb, the boil-
ing temperature, is reached. At this point, the free-energy curve of the gas phase crossesthat of the liquid phase and for all higher temperatures the gas phase is the most stable.The middle ﬁgure corresponds to a constant-pressure line that passes through the triplepoint. Along this isobaric line ( bb) the three free-energy curves cross at a single point (the
triple point) where all three phases may coexist. At temperatures below the triple point,14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 410

the solid phase has the lowest free energy, and at all temperatures above it the gas phase
has the least free energy. At this particular pressure, the liquid phase is only stable at one
temperature—the triple-point temperature. Finally, on the right in Fig. 14.3 is shown
the relative positions of the three free-energy curves when the pressure is very low (that
is, at cc). In this case, the free-energy curve of the liquid phase lies above that of the gas
phase, so that the liquid phase is not stable at any temperature.
14.2 NUCLEATION
The solidiﬁcation of metals occurs by nucleation and growth. The same is also true of melt-
ing, but there is one important difference. Nucleation of the solid phase during freezing is
a much more difﬁcult process than the formation of nuclei of the liquid phase during melt-
ing. As a result, metals do not superheat to any appreciable extent before they are lique-
ﬁed, whereas some supercooling occurs almost every time a metal is frozen. Further,
under appropriate conditions, liquid metals can be cooled to temperatures far below their
equilibrium freezing points before solidiﬁcation begins. This fact is illustrated in Table 14.1,
which gives the maximum supercooling observed for a number of metals. It is not known14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 411

whether any of the values listed in Table 14.1 correspond to freezing by homogeneous
nucleation, since heterogeneous nucleation, where crystals are formed on foreign nucle-
ating sites, reduces the magnitudes of the attainable supercooling. Moreover, the level of
the attainable supercooling depends on the potency of the heterogeneous nucleation sites.
We can conclude that the supercooling corresponding to homogeneous nucleation is at
least as large, if not larger, than the values in Table 14.1.
The difﬁculty associated with the formation of homogeneous nuclei of the solid crys-
talline phase is typical not only of pure metals, but also it occurs in alloys, as can be seen
in Fig. 14.4, which shows it is possible to supercool copper-nickel alloys approximately14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 412

manner, supercooling is reduced and can only amount to a few degrees. The subject
of nucleation in commercial metals will be discussed in more detail when the freezing
of ingots is discussed. Let us ﬁrst, however, brieﬂy treat the subject of nucleation during
melting—the reverse of freezing.
In melting most metals do not normally superheat, although superheating on the
order of 0.1 K has been reported for gallium.5,6
An explanation for this fact has been ordered by Hollomon and Turnbull7based on
the assumption that nucleation in melting occurs on the surfaces of solids. In this case, the
nucleus, consisting of a region of the liquid phase, will be enveloped by two basically dif-
ferent surfaces. On one side is a liquid-solid interface and on the other, a gas-liquid inter-
face. The total surface energy of this pair of surfaces is usually smaller than that of a single
solid-gas interface. This conclusion is obtained from the experimental fact that when a
solid and a liquid are in contact at the melting point, the liquid normally wets the surface
of the solid so that, as proved in college physics textbooks,
ggs/H11022gsl/H11001ggl14.1
where ggs, gsland gglare the surface tensions or surface energies of the gas-solid, solid-liq-
uid, and gas-liquid interfaces, respectively. What Eq. 14.1 really signiﬁes is that the surface
energy associated with liquid nuclei can aid rather than hinder the formation of the nucleus.
Thus, let Fig. 14.5A represent a liquid nucleus at an early stage of development, and Fig.
14.5B the same nucleus at a slightly later time. Spreading of the liquid nucleus along the sur-
face, as shown in these ﬁgures, decreases the area on the gas-solid interface, while increas-
ing those of the gas-liquid and liquid-solid interface. As a result, there is a decrease in surface
energy, and since any rise of the temperature above the equilibrium melting temperature
causes a decrease in the volume free energies, it can be seen that both surface and volume
free energies favor melting for even the slightest amount of superheating. There is also
another factor: the diffusion rate also increases with rising temperature. The rate of a melt-
ing reaction should therefore tend to increase with superheating because of this fact.
14.3 METALLIC GLASSES
In recent years, techniques have been developed to very rapidly cool or quench certain
liquid metallic alloys in order to produce an amorphous or glassy structure. Since some
of these metallic glasses have very unusual and unique properties, the subject of metal-
lic glasses is of considerable interest. To better understand these materials, it is worth14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 413
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 414
considering the basic nature of the glassy state. For this purpose, we will consider the
commercial inorganic glasses, which may be considered as alloys with inorganic oxides
as components. A representative bottle glass, for example, might contain 71 percent
SiO2, 15 percent Na2O, 12 percent CaO, and 2 percent other oxides.
Normally when a composition like the above is cooled from the liquid state, it may
solidify in two alternative ways. If the rate of cooling is below some critical rate, the liquid
may freeze to form a crystalline solid. On the other hand, if the rate of cooling is faster
than the critical rate, it may pass through the freezing range without crystallizing so that
it becomes a supercooled liquid that then transforms into a glass at a lower temperature.
The critical cooling rate, below which crystallization occurs and above which a glass is
formed, is quite low in a common inorganic glass; that is, /H1134910/H110021K/s. This means it is rel-
atively easy to obtain glass structures with these compositions. For metallic alloys, on the
other hand, the formation of a glass structure is quite difﬁcult and requires cooling rates
normally in excess of 105K/s.
At the glass transition point, where a supercooled liquid changes into a glass, disconti-
nuities may appear in plots of certain important properties made against the tempera-
ture. For example, the upper curve of Fig. 14.6A shows schematically the speciﬁc volume,
V(m3/mol), of a liquid that is cooled fast enough to produce a glass. There is an inﬂection or
a change of slope at the point marked Ig, which denotes the glass transition point. On the
other hand, in the lower curve, corresponding to a cooling rate slow enough to allow crys-
tallization to occur, a sharp decrease in volume occurs when the liquid freezes at Tmp. Note
that the slope of this latter cooling curve is less after crystallization than it was before.
Conversely, there is no change in the slope of curve of the more rapidly cooled material as
the melt is cooled past the freezing point and becomes supercooled. It is also signiﬁcant that
the glass transition is not associated with a volume change as is the case when a more
slowly cooled melt freezes. At temperatures below the glass transition the slopes of both the
glass and crystallized solid curves are nearly identical. The volume of the glass, as may be
seen in Fig. 14.6A, is greater than that of the crystalline solid at all temperatures where
the two solid forms can coexist. Furthermore, the volume difference as well as the glass

transition temperature, Tg, depend on the cooling rate, as shown in Fig. 14.6B. This volume
difference, which can be attributed to a more open structure in the glass, is normally not
large; it is in the range of a few percent for silicate glasses. In metallic glasses it is usually ofthe order of 0.5 percent.
8In a glass, long-range order does not exist as in a crystalline solid.
It is generally agreed,9however, that the glass structure has limited short-range order.
The transition on cooling from a supercooled liquid to a glass is believed to be caused
by the very rapid rise of the viscosity of a supercooled liquid when the temperature isdecreased. Although a liquid is normally incapable of supporting a shear stress, a shearstress applied to a liquid can still cause it to ﬂow. This shear of the liquid is resisted by africtional force, and generally one may write:
τ/H11005hdg/H20862dt 14.2
where τis the shear stress, dg/dtis the shear rate of the liquid, and his a constant of
proportionality known as the viscosity. The classical viscosity unit is the poise, which canbe viewed as the shear stress required to move two parallel layers of ﬂuid, 1 cm apart, pasteach other with a velocity of 1 cm/sec. In the international system of units, the unit ofdynamic viscosity is a pascal second (Pa-s). One Pa-s equals 10 poise.
As mentioned previously, the viscosity of a typical glass melt increases rapidly as the
temperature is decreased. With the aid of empirical observations combined with theoreti-cal deductions, an approximate equation has been developed
10that is capable of describ-
ing with some accuracy the temperature dependence of the viscosity. This is known as theVogel-Futcher-Tammann equation (VFT equation) and has the form:
log h/H11005A/H11001B/H20862(T/H11002T0) 14.3
where his the viscosity; Tis the absolute temperature; and A, B, and T0are constants.
These constants may be evaluated for a given material by using corresponding values of h
and Tfor three points on the viscosity-temperature curve. Three convenient points to use
for this purpose are:
1.The Glass Transition Point . At the glass transition point the viscosity is normally
1012Pa-s. The glass transition temperature can be measured in terms of the inﬂec-
tion point on a dilatometric curve, which gives the variation in length of a glassspecimen as a function of its temperature. Such a curve will be similar to thatshown schematically in Fig. 14.6, where the glass transition occurs at the inﬂec-tion point marked T
g.
2.The Softening Point (Littleton Point) . This point is measured10using a glass ﬁber with
a diameter between 1 and 6.5 mm with a length of 27.9 cm. The ﬁber is hung ver-tically from its upper end inside a furnace where it is heated at a rate between5 and 10 K/min. The creep rate is measured by following the movement of thelower end of the ﬁber. On the basis of empirical measurements it has been deter-mined that when the creep rate of the ﬁber is 1 mm/min, h/H1100510
5.5Pa-s. Thus,
the softening point is determined by measuring the temperature at which a creeprate of 1 mm/min is attained and by assuming that the viscosity equals 10
5.5Pa-s
at this temperature.
3.The Sinking Point . This point was developed11by Dietzel and Bruckner. It involves
the use of a small 80 percent platinum 20 percent rhodium rod with a diameterof 0.5 mm, a length of 20 cm, and a weight of 0.746 gm. The temperature atwhich this rod sinks to a depth of 2 cm in a time of 2.0 min. has been found to14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 415
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 416
correspond to a viscosity of 103.22Pa-s. In essence, this technique involves vary-
ing the temperature in small steps until the desired sinking rate is observed.
Scholze12has given the following viscosity-temperature data (for the three ﬁxed
points listed above) for a speciﬁc glass; Jena thermometer Glass 16III.

Substituting these data in Eq. 14.3 gives three simultaneous equations, which allows
the three constants in Eq. 14.3 to be evaluated. The results are A/H11005/H110022.866, B/H110053830.3,
and T0/H11005561.8 K so that Eq. 14.3 becomes, for this glass,
log h/H11005/H110022.386 /H110013830.3/( T/H11002561.8) 14.4
The variation of log h, with temperature, T, computed with this equation is shown in
Fig. 14.7. The positions of the glass transition and the softening and sinking points are also
marked in Fig. 14.7. It is interesting that glass is normally mechanically worked between a
viscosity of 105and 102.5Pa-s, or roughly between the softening and sinking points. In addi-
tion, glass is annealed to remove internal stresses near the glass transition point.
As mentioned earlier, at the glass transition point, signiﬁcant changes occur in the
physical properties of a material cooled so as to yield a glass. For example, Fig. 14.6 shows
that the coefﬁcient of volume expansion (or linear expansion) decreases sharply below the
glass transition point. Figure 14.8 shows that the speciﬁc heat ( Cp) of a crystalline solid14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 416

Temperature, K FIG. 14.8 A schematic drawing that shows the
difference between the variation with
temperature of the speciﬁc heat ( Cp) of a glass
and a crystalline solid
decreases smoothly and continuously on cooling. The same substance, when cooled so as
to give a glass, will have a larger speciﬁc heat as it becomes a supercooled liquid. Also, as
the temperature decreases, the difference between the speciﬁc heats of the supercooled
liquid and the crystalline solid increases until the glass transition point is reached.
However, at the transition point, the Cpof the supercooled melt falls and becomes approx-
imately equal to that of the crystalline solid. Below the glass transition point, the speciﬁc
heats of glass and solid are approximately the same.
As suggested above, the changes that occur in the supercooled liquid as it becomes a
glass are believed to be directly associated with the viscosity of the melt. Below the glass
point, viscous ﬂow of the melt becomes so slow that it begins to behave as if it were elas-
tic, and the diffusive motion of atoms past each other becomes so slow that material
becomes, as described by Turnbull,13conﬁgurationally frozen . That is, the supercooled liquid
state existing at the glass transition becomes to all intents and purposes frozen in place at
temperatures below Tg.
It is also true that the viscosity is closely related to the rate at which a shear stress can
be relaxed. Accordingly, if a viscous ﬂow produced by a shear stress is interrupted, the
shear stress, τ, existing at this time will normally decrease at a rate proportional to the
shear stress remaining or:
dτ/dt/H11005/H11002 τ/tr14.5
where τis the shear stress, tis the time, and tris a constant called the relaxation time . As
originally proposed by Maxwell, tris closely related to the viscosity by the equation:
h/H11005Gtr14.6
where Gis the shear modulus.
The shear modulus of a typical glass is of the order of 2 /H110031010Pa-s. Assuming that
this value does not change signiﬁcantly for small temperature changes near Tgand that
h/H110051012Pa-s at Tg, then at Tg, trshould be about 50 s or approximately 1 min. Thus, in
terms of the data in Fig. 14.7, a shear stress can be effectively relaxed in about 1 min. at
550 K. Lowering the temperature to 500 K, according to Fig. 14.7, increases hto about14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 417
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 418
1016Pa-s and the relaxation time to approximately 5 /H11003105s or 140 hours or nearly
6 days. Thus, below the glass transition temperature the glass relaxes so slowly that it may
be considered to be elastic for all practical purposes.
In summary, above Tg, a supercooled liquid that is being cooled at a ﬁxed rate is able
to maintain a state of internal equilibrium. Its free energy, however, is higher than that of
the crystalline solid and it is metastable relative to the crystalline solid. Because atomic dif-
fusion is so slow below Tg, it is no longer possible to maintain internal equilibrium in a
supercooled liquid when it is cooled below Tg. However, it should be remembered that Tg
is normally measured in glass samples subjected to a ﬁxed rate of cooling and that the glass
transition point normally depends on this cooling rate. The slower this cooling rate, the
lower the temperature below which internal equilibrium can no longer be maintained;
that is, the lower Tg. In practice, a standard rate of 4 K/s is commonly used so that Tgwill
have a ﬁxed reference value.
As already suggested, the rate of cooling also has an important bearing on whether or
not a given substance can be converted into a glass. Normally, a critical cooling rate exists
below which a sufﬁcient degree of crystallization will occur so that it cannot be considered
a glass. Above this critical rate, of course, a glass is obtained. This critical cooling rate is a
measure of the ease with which one can attain a glass structure on cooling. In a typical
inorganic glass, crystallization occurs with difﬁculty and the critical cooling rate is very
slow and of the order of 10/H110021K/s.
Thus, in theory it should be possible to attain a glass structure in any metal provided
that it can be cooled fast enough from the melt so that crystallization does not occur.
Unfortunately, metal liquids tend to have very low viscosities and to crystallize very rapidly.
According to Turnbull13there have been no reports of the successful quenching of pure
metal melts to glasses. On the other hand, metallic glasses have been successfully obtained
with a number of metallic alloys. These alloys, for the most part, have had compositions
lying near deep eutectic points, whose temperatures were very low. The reason for this is
not difﬁcult to understand. A schematic two-component phase diagram is shown in 
Fig. 14.9. It is important to remember that, to obtain a glass, crystallization should be
prevented. The liquid must be cooled through the freezing range and past the glass
transition temperature before a signiﬁcant number of crystals have been able to form. Once

the supercooled melt is below Tg, crystallization is in theory no longer possible. According
to Turnbull,13Tgis not strongly dependent upon composition. With this in mind, compare
the freezing of the two compositions 1 and 2 in Fig. 14.9. Composition 1 passes through the
liquidus line at a high temperature designated as ain Fig. 14.9. At this temperature the
atomic mobility is very high so that crystallization of the aphase should occur easily in the
melt. Furthermore, the freezing range is large since it extends roughly from ato Tg. This
means that the melt has to be cooled over a very large temperature range in which it is pos-sible for acrystals to form and grow. On the other hand, at Composition 2 the liquidus lies
at a much lower temperature so that the thermal energy available for crystal growth issmaller and at the same time the temperature interval between the liquidus and T
gis short.
Practically speaking, this means that a glass structure can be obtained with this latter com-position using a slower rate of cooling. It should be emphasized, however, that the above-mentioned practical reasoning may not hold true for all cases. For example, consider theglass-forming ability of binary alloy Cu
100/H11002xZrx(x/H1100534, 36, 38.2, and 40 at. %) series. It
has been recently shown14that the best glass former Cu64Zr36corresponds neither to the
largest supercooling region nor to the highest reduced glass transition temperature.Obviously, there are other factors
15that have a bearing on the ease of glass formation. Large
differences in the sizes of the atoms of the components may tend to inhibit crystallizationand make the formation of a glass easier. Another consideration is the nature of the atomicbinding between the components.
The early works on production of metallic glasses had concentrated mainly on
binary alloy compositions, using very fast cooling rates of 10
5k/s or higher. For a com-
prehensive description of some of these works, see the 1967 Campbell Memorial Lectureof Pol Duwez.
16Because of the high cooling rate requirement, these metallic glasses
were generally in the form of powders, wires, and ribbons since the cooling rate duringsolidiﬁcation is roughly proportional to the inverse square of sample thickness. As anexample, Gilman
17has described the continuous casting of speciﬁc ferrous alloys to pro-
duce glass ribbons of great length at speeds ranging from 7.5 to 30 m/s. The thickness ofthese ribbons was between 25 and 130 mm and their width was between 0.08 and
50 mm. One set of alloys was based on the Fe–Be system, with other elements added toenhance either processing conditions or some of the physical aspects of the materials inthe ribbons. These ribbons may be produced by projecting a narrow stream of liquidalloy onto a rotating cold copper wheel. Under the proper conditions, the jet spreads outas it contacts the wheel and solidiﬁes into a continuous ribbon.
In the past two decades, it has been shown that bulk metallic glasses can be formed
from a variety of multicomponent bulk glass-forming alloys at rather low cooling rates.For example, Pd
40Cu30Ni10P20requires a critical cooling rate of 0.10 k/s to form metallic
glass.18As such, the alloy can be produced by normal casting techniques with thick-
nesses approaching 100 mm. Other bulk metallic galls alloys consist of Mg-, lanthanide-,
Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu, and Ni-based systems. A comprehensive review of the other bulkmetallic glass produced can be found in a paper by Inoue,
19who attributes the enhanced
glass-forming ability of these alloys to the stabilization of the supercooled liquid. Inoue alsosuggests the following three empirical requirements to form bulk metallic glasses: (1) mul-ticomponent alloy systems consisting of more than three elements, (2) atomic size ratiodifference larger than 12 percent among the three main constituents, and (3) negativeheat of mixing of the three main constituents.
It is signiﬁcant that although metallic glasses are formed from supercooled liquids,
as are the inorganic glasses, and that the former as well as the latter can be considered14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 419
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 420
amorphous solids, the metallic glasses still possess many of the aspects of a true metal. Thus,
they can have the high conductivity and characteristic metallic sheen of a metal. Therefore,it is difﬁcult to visually differentiate between a metallic glass and a crystalline metal.
Metallic glasses exhibit many unique physical and mechanical properties, such as high
strength coupled with high ductility, high corrosion resistance, and soft ferromagnetism inFe-NI-Co-based metallic glasses.
19These glasses are among the most easily magnetized of
all the ferromagnetic materials, while at the same time possessing high saturation magne-tizations. As far as their mechanical behavior is concerned, metallic glasses deform byhomogeneous shear above their glass transition temperatures. In this type of ﬂow, everyatom or molecule responds to the applied shear stress and participates in the deformationprocess. Homogeneous shear ﬂow is the common deformation mechanism in liquids, andin this respect metallic glasses above their transition temperatures behave like liquids (pro-vided that they do not crystallize).
Below the glass transition temperature, however, the deformation of metallic glasses is
highly inhomogeneous,
20and occurs as a result of the formation of highly locallized shear
bands. Each shear band is normally accompanied by an extensive local offset. For example,Masumato and Maddin
21found 20 nm thick shear bands in the alloy Pd80-Si20, with shear
offsets of about 200 nm. Consequently, the formation of multiple shear bands can produceextensive or macroscopic ductility. Pampillo and Chen
22have shown that a 40 percent
reduction in height could be obtained from shear bands upon compressing small cylindersof Pd75-Cu6-Sil6.5. The existence of shear bands in metallic glasses is considered to indicatethe absence of work hardening in these materials. In general, in materials that undergo workhardening, shear bands may move laterally into undeformed regions only at low strains. Onthe other hand, in metallic glasses, the absence of work hardening allows continuing defor-mation along existing shear bands. Because of their lack of work hardening, the tensilestrengths of metallic glasses are normally approximately equal to their yield strengths.
Another attractive property of metallic glasses is higher corrosion resistance than
observed in polycrystalline materials. A factor contributing heavily to this is the superiorchemical homogeneity of metallic glasses. Another consideration is their general lack ofgrain boundaries and defects such as dislocations. For these same reasons, metallic glassesare more resistant to pitting attack in acidic solutions.
19,23For example, the pitting resist-
ance of Fe70-P13-C7 in sulfuric acid solutions containing chloride ions is considerably bet-ter than that of 18Cr-8Ni stainless steel.
14.4 CRYSTAL GROWTH FROM THE LIQUID PHASE
It has been shown24that the movement of the boundary separating a liquid from a solid
crystalline phase, under a temperature gradient normal to the boundary, may be consid-ered the resultant of two different atomic movements. Thus, at the interface, those atomsthat leave the liquid and join the solid determine a rate of attachment, while those thattravel in the opposite direction determine a rate of detachment. Whether the boundarymoves so as to increase or decrease the amount of solid depends on whether or not therate of attachment is larger than the rate of detachment. This point of view is equivalentto viewing the movement of the interface as a two-directional diffusion problem in which

where Rfand Rmare the rates of attachment and detachment respectively, Rf0and Rm0are
approximate constants, Qfand Qmare activation energies, and Rand Thave their usual
signiﬁcance.
The activation energy Qfrepresents the energy to take an atom that lies on the liquid
side of the boundary to the saddle point, as shown in Fig. 14.10. Similarly, Qmrepresents
the energy required to bring an atom on the solid side of the interface up to the saddle
point. In Fig. 14.10, the potential energy wells shown on each side of the saddle point dif-
fer by the latent heat of fusion. An atom in the solid possesses a lower energy than one in
the liquid, but it should be noted that it also possesses a lower entropy.
The rates of attachment, Rf, and detachment, Rm, may be expressed either as atoms per
second crossing the boundary or as velocities of the boundary in centimeters per second.
The constants Rf0and Rm0depend on a number of factors that can be estimated. This has
been done for copper by Chalmers, as may be seen in Fig. 14.11, which shows the curves
for the freezing rate and the melting rate as functions of temperature. Notice that they inter-
sect at the equilibrium melting point of copper. Another interesting feature of Fig. 14.11 is
that on either side of the true melting point the curves diverge sharply. The difference in
the individual rates determines the actual rate with which the interface moves, which sig-
niﬁes that the observed growth rate, or melting rate, increases as the temperature deviates
from the equilibrium freezing point.
14.5 THE HEATS OF FUSION AND VAPORIZATION
The heat of vaporization can be considered a measure of the energy to remove an atom
from a solid surface and place it in the vapor. In other words, this is the energy required
to break the bonds binding the atom to its neighbors at the surface. Atoms leaving the sur-
face to enter the vapor are generally believed to do so at jogs in ledges on the surface. Such
a ledge with jog is shown in Fig. 14.12, where the shaded circles represent the atoms of an
incomplete plane. The atom, marked A, in the uppermost row of the incomplete plane
lying next to the jog is in nearest neighbor contact with three other atoms in the incom-
plete plane as well as with three atoms in the complete plane below it. The total number
of atomic bonds that are broken when this atom leaves the surface is therefore six.Distance Latent heat

AFIG. 14.12 Atoms leaving the surface of a crystal
to join the vapor phase are normally assumed to
do so at a jog in a surface ledge, as shown at
atom( A)
Furthermore, when an atom is removed from a jog, the atom behind it assumes an equiv-
alent position so that the removal or addition of atoms to a jog is a repeatable process.
Another possibility is the loss or addition of a single atom sitting on a close-packed plane,
such as the atom Bin Fig. 14.12. These are bound to the surface by only three bonds so
that their vaporization requires much less energy than the removal of an atom from a jog.
However, such an event is not repeatable as is the loss of an atom from a jog. A possibil-
ity does exist, nevertheless, that an atom at an Aposition may leave the jog and diffuse to
a Bposition, and then leave the surface. This dual event still requires breaking six bonds;
three when it leaves the jog and three when it leaves the surface by evaporation. This
sequence is therefore, equivalent to the direct removal of an atom from a jog.
Consequently, the heat of vaporization of a single atom is generally assumed to be equiva-
lent to breaking six atomic bonds.
The relations involved in the evaporation of atoms from a surface can be reversed
when one considers growth from the vapor. An individual atom may arrive at a position
such as Bin Fig. 14.12, with the formation of three solid bonds, and then move by surface
diffusion to a jog where three more bonds are created.
Solidiﬁcation to a faceted interface from a melt is normally treated as analogous to
growth from the vapor; that is, by the addition of atoms from the liquid to jogs or by the
deposition of atoms on close-packed surfaces followed by surface diffusion to jogs.
However, a noticeable difference exists in the size of the bonds formed when an atom
leaves the melt to join a solid, compared to those formed when it leaves the vapor to join
a solid. The size of the latter bonds is naturally much smaller, in agreement with the large
difference between the heats of fusion and vaporization. In a pure metal, the heat of fusion
is normally about 1/20th the heat of vaporization. Thus, in pure mercury at 234 K the heat
of fusion is 11.8 J/gr-mol, while the heat of vaporization is 309 J/gr-mol.
The breaking of the bonds associated with removing an atom from the surface is rea-
sonably easy to model for vaporization. Here an atom is removed from intimate contact
with its neighbors and placed into a gas where its interaction energy with other gaseous
atoms may be considered negligible. On the other hand, when an atom leaves the surface
to enter the melt, the picture is not well deﬁned. Atomic binding in the liquid is not well
understood. It is, moreover, only slightly less than that in the solid as implied by the small
size of the heat of fusion. In spite of this difﬁculty, the freezing or melting process has been
reasonably well modeled using concepts developed to explain the growth or loss of a solid
in contact with its vapor. Thus, a metal is assumed to solidify primarily by the movement
of jogs along ledges. As an atom attaches itself to a solid at a jog, six bonds are assumed to
be formed with each bond representing one-sixth of the heat of fusion. The major differ-
ence in the solidiﬁcation of different materials will, however, depend on the population of
the jogs and the nature of the liquid-solid interface.14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 422
423 14.6 The Nature of the Liquid-Solid Interface
14.6 THE NATURE OF THE LIQUID-SOLID INTERFACE
It is now realized that the interface between the liquid and the solid can vary consider-
ably in structure depending on the nature of the material solidifying and the amount of
the supercooling at the interface. However, to reduce the complexity of the problem one
usually considers only the two extreme cases. These are (1) the diffuse and (2) the atom-
ically smooth interfaces. In the diffuse interface, the change from the liquid to solid is
assumed to occur over a number of atomic layers in which the liquid structure changes
gradually to that of the solid.25In other words, the ordering of atoms from the non-crys-
talline liquid state to the crystalline solid state is gradual. This type of interface is repre-
sented very roughly in Fig. 14.13A, where the solid lies at the left of the ﬁgure and liquid
at its right. This two-dimensional cut through the interface indicates the presence of
numerous closely spaced ledges. In three dimensions one can also assume that many
closely spaced jogs occur on these ledges. The signiﬁcant feature of this model is that it
implies that this interface has a very high accommodation factor for the liquid atoms.
Thus, growth occurs by the addition of atoms continuously at every atomic site and the

FIG. 14.14 Planes of looser packing, such as {100}, are better able
to accommodate an atom that leaves the liquid to join the solid than
a closer packed plane, such as {111}. Illustrated planes correspond
to a face-centered cubic lattice. (After Chalmers, B., Trans. AIME , 200
519 [1954].)interface advances normal to itself. This type of growth mechanism is called continuous
or normal growth . A two-dimensional cut of an atomically ﬂat interface is shown in
Fig. 14.13B. While this interface is basically closed-packed, it is also assumed to have a
few ledges with jogs. These ledges spread parallel to the interface, that is, laterally, upon
the attachment of atoms to them. As will be described later, the interface remains sta-
tionary except during the passage of the ledges.
We shall now return to a consideration of the constants Rf0and Rm0, which appear
in the rate equations (Eqs. 14.7). One of the factors that determine the magnitude of
these constants is known as the accommodation factor , the chance that an atom in a given
phase, either the liquid or the solid, can ﬁnd a position on the other side of the bound-
ary where it can attach itself. For the movement of atoms from the solid to the liquid,
the accommodation factor should be more or less independent of the chemical nature
of the atoms composing the liquid. This follows from the fact that the liquid phases of
metals have very similar structures. On the other hand, different crystalline structures
present entirely different types of surfaces toward the liquid phase, so that the accom-
modation factor for the motion of atoms from the liquid toward the solid varies with the
nature of the solid. It is also true that the motion of atoms from the liquid to the solid
depends on the indices of the particular crystalline plane that faces the liquid. The less
close-packed the plane, the easier it is for liquid atoms to attach themselves to the crys-
tal. This fact may be explained with the aid of Fig. 14.14, which represents a face-cen-
tered cubic structure, which shows the atomic arrangements on {100} and {111}
surfaces. The holes, or pockets, in the surface available for the accommodation of a liq-
uid atom as it joins the crystal are larger for the less close-packed {100} plane than for
the more closely packed {111} plane. As a result of this difference, for a given amount
of supercooling there is a difference in the growth velocity of the two crystallographic
planes: the least closely packed plane grows with the greater velocity.
The fact that low-atomic-density planes grow faster does not mean that a
growing crystal assumes faces that are planes of this type. On the contrary, the ten-
dency is for the crystal to assume faces that are close-packed, or slow-growing.
The reason for this is easy to understand, for the low-density planes of fast growth
tend to grow themselves out of existence, leaving behind only close-packed surfaces.
This effect is shown schematically in Fig. 14.15, where several stages in the growth
of the faces of a crystal are shown.14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 424
425 14.7 Continuous Growth
It has already been indicated that the rate with which the interface between liquid and
solid moves during solidiﬁcation is a function of the amount of super-cooling. In addition,
the interface motion is also affected by the sign of the temperature gradient in front of the
interface. Thus, the crystal-growth process, when the temperature gradient in advance of
the interface is a rising one, is different from that when the gradient is a falling one. These
two cases will be considered later.
14.7 CONTINUOUS GROWTH
An ideal diffuse liquid-solid interface is predicted to undergo continuous growth at a rate
varying linearly with the amount of undercooling at the interface. This may be rational-
ized as follows:
The jump rate of the atoms in a pure metal liquid, /H9263l, is related to the liquid diffusion
coefﬁcient by the expression:
/H9263l/H110056Dl/l214.8
where Dlis the liquid diffusion coefﬁcient and lis the mean jump distance. It is now
assumed that Dlcan be expressed by:
Dl/H11005l2/H92630exp[ /H11002/H9004Gl/RT] 14.9
where /H92630is the atomic vibration frequency. Thus,
/H9263l/H110056/H92630exp[ /H11002/H9004Gl/RT] 14.10
and /H9004Glis the free energy of activation for liquid diffusion. A relation can now be written
for the rate at which atoms jump from the liquid to the solid
/H9263ls/H11005/H9263l/6/H11005/H92630exp[ /H11002/H9004Gl/RT] 14.11
In deriving Eq. 14.11, it is assumed that the atomic migration and diffusion at or
near the interface is the same as that in the bulk liquid. This may not be true for a dif-
fuse interface for which the properties are expected to change gradually from that of the
bulk liquid to that of the bulk solid. In other words, within the interfacial region, the
portion near the solid is more like a solid while the portion near the liquid is more like
a liquid. Therefore, the diffusivity is expected to vary and depend on the location within
the interface, and particularily to be different from D1.Slow growing plane

Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 426
The corresponding atomic jump rate from solid to liquid, /H9263sl, involves the breaking of
the atomic bonds holding the atoms to the solid surface. In other words, the free energy
of melting, /H9004Gm, must be added to /H9004Gl. Accordingly,
/H9263sl/H11005/H92630exp[ /H11002(/H9004Gl/H11001/H9004Gm)/RT] 14.12
The net rate of interchange of atoms between solid and liquid is therefore
/H9263net/H11005/H9263ls/H11002/H9263sl/H11005/H92630exp[ /H11002/H9004Gl/RT] /H11080{1/H11002exp[ /H11002/H9004Gm/RT]} 14.13
Near the equilibrium freezing point, /H9004Gmis small compared to RTso that /H9004Gm/RTis
small compared to unity and Eq. 14.13 can be reduced, with the aid of Eq. 14.8, to
/H9263net/H11005/H92630[exp( /H11002/H9004Gl/RT)] /H11080(/H9004Gm/RT)/H11005Dl/H9004Gm/l2RT 14.14
Now consider /H9004Gm. At Tm, the equilibrium freezing temperature, /H9004Gm/H110050 and
/H9004Gm/H11005/H9004H/H11002Tm/H9004S/H110050 14.15
where /H9004Hand /H9004Sare the enthalpy and entropy of freezing. However, if under-cooling
should occur:
/H9004Gm/H11005/H9004H/H11002T/H9004S/H110140 14.16
where Tis the temperature at which freezing occurs. Now letting T/H11005Tm/H11002/H9004T, we have
/H9004Gm/H11005/H9004H/H11002Tm/H9004S/H11001/H9004T/H9004S 14.17
Since most bulk metals tend to freeze at temperatures very close to Tm, and /H9004Hand /H9004Sare
not strongly temperature dependent, we may assume that the ﬁrst two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 14.17 cancel (see Eq. 14.15), and remembering that /H9004S/H11005/H9004H/T
m, one
obtains
/H9004Gm/H11005/H9004H/H9004T/Tm14.18
Substituting this last relation into Eq. 14.14 gives
/H9263net/H11005Dl/H9004H/H9004T/(l2RTm) 14.19
If it is now assumed that lcan be equated to the lattice parameter of the solid, a, and
that the rate of advance of the interface, V, equals atimes /H9263netthen:
V/H11005a/H9263net/H11005bDl/H9004Hm/H9004T/(aRTm2) 14.20
where Vis the growth rate, /H9004Hmthe freezing enthalpy, Dlthe liquid diffusion coefﬁcient at Tm,
Tmthe equilibrium freezing point temperature, athe lattice parameter of the solid, /H9004Tthe
amount of undercooling, and the coefﬁcient bis introduced to correct for the various assump-
tions made in deriving the rate equation.26Equation 14.20 may now be simpliﬁed to read:
V/H11005B/H9004T 14.21
which shows that the solidiﬁcation rate of a diffuse interface is a linear function of theinterface supercooling.14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 426
427 14.8 Lateral Growth
14.8 LATERAL GROWTH
The diffuse interface represented by Fig. 14.13A is replete with many ledges containing
jogs at which an atom moving from the liquid may attach itself to the solid and attain the
six bonds of the heat of fusion. Such a surface has a very high accommodation factor and
growth occurs readily. This is not the case when the surface may be described as atomi-
cally ﬂat (faceted), as is the case with many metals. Examples include Bi, Ga, Si, and inter-
metallic compounds such as Nb5Si3and NbSi2.
Atomically ﬂat interfaces are believed to grow primarily by the movement of ledges
over these surfaces. This type of growth is known as lateral growth . The existence of ledges
on this type of interface can be explained in several ways. One explanation involves sur-
face nucleation and growth of two-dimensional discs as indicated in Figs. 14.16A and
14.16B. Another explanation is related to the surface discontinuity caused by the intersec-
tion of a twin boundary with the surface. However, of more importance is the fact that
when a screw dislocation emerges at the surface of a crystal, a ledge is automatically pro-
duced. This may be seen in the simple screw dislocation models of Figs. 4.13, 4.14, and
14.16C. As indicated in Fig. 14.17, these ledges are capable of moving across a crystal sur-
face as atoms join or leave the solid at jogs lying along the ledges. Since one end of the
ledge in Fig. 14.17 is anchored at a screw dislocation, the movement of the ledge across
the surface tends to make the ledge take the shape of a spiral whose center is at the point
of emergence of the dislocation line, as shown in Fig. 14.16C. As the spiral ledge makes a
complete rotation about the screw dislocation, an extra plane is either added or removed
from the crystal depending upon whether the crystal is growing or decreasing in size.
Support for believing that growth spirals associated with screw dislocations are important

addition of atoms to a jog on the ledge
that forms when a screw dislocation
intersects a crystal surface
in crystal growth comes from the fact that most crystals in bulk are known to contain sig-
niﬁcant numbers of growth dislocations.
Lateral growth by screw dislocation ledges has been treated theoretically and is pre-
dicted to be controlled by an equation of the form
V/H11005B2(/H9004T)214.22
where B2is a constant and /H9004Tis the amount of undercooling.
For lateral growth by two-dimensional nucleation, the growth rate is an exponential
function of the reciprocal of the supercooling.27,28The rate equation depends on whether
a single nucleus forms per layer (mononuclear) or many nuclei form simultaneously. The
two respective equations are

where B3, B4, and B5are constants, and Ais the surface area.
14.9 STABLE INTERFACE FREEZING
The foregoing discussions dealt with the atomistic mechanisms of growth and the nature
of the interface on an atomic scale. Another factor that has a strong effect on the shape of
the interface on a macroscopic scale is the removal of the heat of fusion from the inter-
face. Let it be assumed that the temperature gradient rises as we move from an interface
into a pure liquid, and that the temperature gradient is linear and perpendicular to the
interface. Under these conditions, the interface is believed to maintain a stable planar
shape and move forward as a unit. If by chance a close-packed plane (one of slow growth)
lies perpendicular to the heat-ﬂow direction, a strictly planar interface should, in theory,
develop. However, the chance of ﬁnding a close-packed plane in exactly the right position14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 428
429 14.10 Dendritic Growth in Pure Metals
is very small, and one has to consider those cases where a crystallographic plane of 
high-atomic density is almost parallel to the interface, as well as those situations where the
interface does not approximate any high-density plane.
Consider the ﬁrst of these possibilities. Here the interface tends to develop a series of
close-packed planar steps. A schematic example of such a surface is shown in Fig. 14.18.
Since each of the facets has an inclination in the heat-ﬂow direction, the temperature can-
not be uniform over its entire area. Because of the rising temperature in advance of the
interface, those portions of each facet that are most advanced will be in contact with hot-
ter liquid than those portions to the rear. Since, for a given crystallographic plane, the rate
of growth is a function of the degree of supercooling, it is not possible for the facets to
maintain a strictly crystallographic surface and grow with a constant velocity. As a conse-
quence, the steps assume a curved shape. The most advanced, or hotter, portion of each
facet corresponds to a lower indice, or higher accommodation factor surface, while the
most retarded, or cooler, portion corresponds to a slow-growing, or lower, accommodation
factor surface. In this manner, it should be possible to obtain an interface that grows at a
constant speed.
The structure described in the preceding paragraph is that which attains when close-
packed planes are nearly parallel to the interface. When there are no close-packed planes
approximately parallel to the interface, a simpler interface, consisting of a random (crys-
tallographic) planar surface, may be more stable. Such an interface is similar to one
obtained when a close-packed crystallographic plane is strictly perpendicular to the heat
ﬂow direction, but differs in that it is not a close-packed plane, but a plane with high, or
irrational, indices.
14.10 DENDRITIC GROWTH IN PURE METALS
A very important type of crystalline growth occurs when the liquid-solid interface moves
into a supercooled liquid whose temperature falls, or decreases, in advance of the inter-
face. One of the most important ways that a temperature gradient of this nature can form
is as follows.
Suppose that Fig. 14.19 represents a region containing a liquid-solid interface and that
the heat is ﬂowing away from the interface in both directions; that is, the heat is being
removed through both the solid and the supercooled liquid. Because of the heat of fusionArea of higher

Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 430
released at the interface, the temperature of the interface usually rises above that of both
the liquid and the solid. Under these conditions, the temperature drops as one moves from
the interface into the solid, because this is the heat-ﬂow direction. It also falls off into the
liquid because there is a natural ﬂow of heat from the interface into the supercooled liq-
uid. The resulting temperature contour is shown in Fig. 14.19 and is known in general as
a temperature inversion .29
When the temperature falls in the liquid in advance of the interface, the latter
becomes unstable and, in the presence of any small perturbation, cells may grow out from
the general interface into the liquid. The resulting structure may also become quite com-
plicated, with secondary branches forming on the primary cell, and possibly with tertiary
branches forming on the secondary ones. The resulting branched crystal often has the
appearance of a miniature pine tree and is, accordingly, called a dendrite after the Greek
word dendrites meaning “of a tree.”
The reasons for the branched growth of a crystal into a liquid whose temperature falls
in advance of the solid are not hard to understand. Whenever a small section of the inter-
face (perturbation) ﬁnds itself ahead of the surrounding surface, it will be in contact with
liquid metal at a lower temperature. Its growth velocity will be increased relative to the
surrounding surface, which is in contact with liquid at a higher temperature, and the for-
mation of a cell is only to be expected. Associated with the development of each cell is the
release of a quantity of heat (latent heat of fusion). This heat raises the temperature of the
liquid adjacent to any given cell and retards the formation of other similar projections on
the general interface in the immediate vicinity of a given projection. The net result is that
a number of cells of almost equal spacing are formed that grow parallel to each other in
the fashion shown in Fig. 14.20. The direction in which these cells grow is crystallographic
and is known as the dendritic growth direction . The direction of dendritic growth depends on
the crystal structure of a metal, as may be seen in Table 14.2.
The branches, or cells, shown in Fig. 14.20 are ﬁrst order, or primary, in nature.
How secondary branches may form from primary ones will now be considered. For this

purpose consider Fig. 14.21, where section aarepresents the general interface. Notice
that in this ﬁgure the direction of dendritic growth is assumed to be normal to the gen-
eral interface. This is done to simplify the presentation. Once the cells have formed,
growth at the general interface will be slow because here the supercooling is small and
the latent heat of fusion associated with the formation of the cells tends to further
decrease its magnitude. At section bb, on the other hand, the average temperature of the
liquid is, by deﬁnition, lower than at aa. However, even on this section at points in the
liquid close to the cell walls, the temperature will be higher than midway between the
cells ( TA/H11022TB) because of the latent heat released at the cells. There is, therefore, a
decreasing temperature gradient not only in front of the primary cells, but also in direc-
tions perpendicular to the primary branches. This temperature gradient is responsible for
the formation of secondary branches, which form at more or less regular intervals along
the primary branches, as shown in Fig. 14.22. Since the secondary branches form for the
same basic reasons as the primary branches, their directions of rapid growth are along
directions equivalent crystallographically to those taken by primary arms. In the case of
cubic metals, dendrite arms may form along all of the /H20855100 /H20856directions and the arms are
perpendicular to each other. Similarly, tertiary branches will form from the secondary
branches if the space is available for their growth. The shape of the dendrite tip and
formation of secondary branches during growth of transparent materials are shown in
Fig. 14.23. The materials, succinonitrile and pivalic anhydride were grown under micro-
gravity conditions by M. E. Glicksman and his colleagues. For additional information,
consult references 30–32. The dendrite arms usually grow in thickness as they grow in
length, with the eventual result that the arms grow together to form a single nearly homo-
geneous crystal.TABLE 14.2 Dendritic Growth Directions in Various Crystal Structures.*

Dendritic growth, as outlined above, will occur in the freezing of pure metals when
the interface is allowed to move forward into sufﬁciently supercooled liquid. In metals of
relatively low purity, however, it is almost impossible to obtain enough thermal supercool-
ing, so the entire freezing process is not dendritic unless heat is constantly removed from
the liquid. In the absence of efﬁcient heat removal from the liquid, the temperature rises
very rapidly to its melting point because of the heat release at the interface. This rapid tem-
perature rise, which follows nucleation of a supercooled liquid, is called recalescence .
In the absence of cooling from outside, a very large supercooling (of the order of 100 K)
is required in pure metals for complete dendritic freezing. The amount of solid that forms
from a supercooled liquid without heat removal by the surroundings can be estimated from:

14.11 FREEZING IN ALLOYS WITH PLANAR INTERFACE
Several examples of freezing in simple alloy systems will now be discussed. Consider an
isomorphous-alloy system with the phase diagram shown in Fig. 14.24A. In this system
at the temperature T1, solid of composition ( a) is in equilibrium with liquid of composi-
tion ( b). Let it now be assumed that Fig. 14.24B represents a volume of liquid of compo-
sition ( b) placed in a long tubular mold and that heat is only removed from the left end
of the mold so that the heat ﬂow is linear and from right to left. Under these conditions,
freezing will start at the left end of the liquid and the small volume element ( dx) may be
taken to represent the ﬁrst solid to form. The freezing of this volume element will take
place at temperature T1and the composition of the solid will correspond to point ( a) in
Fig. 14.24A. If this layer of solid is frozen in a relatively short period of time with
negligible solid-state diffusion, we can assume that it is formed from the liquid layer

adjacent to the interface and not from the entire volume of the liquid. Since the solid
contains a higher ratio of Ato Batoms than does the liquid layer from which it forms,
the latter is depleted in Aatoms and enriched in Batoms. This composition change in the
liquid just ahead of the interface increases as more solid is formed, but the increase even-
tually stops when a steady-state condition is attained. Concurrent with the change in
composition of the liquid next to the interface is a similar change in the composition of
the solid that can form from this layer of liquid. Thus, if the composition of the liquid cor-
responds to point din Fig. 14.24A, then the solid that freezes must have the composition
of point c. It is also important to recognize that the indicated freezing process can only
occur if the temperature at the interface is lowered from T1to T2. The concentration of
an excess of Batoms in the liquid adjacent to the interface reaches a maximum when the
liquid next to the solid attains the composition of point e. At this instant the liquid is able
to freeze solid of composition b. When this occurs, the steady state has been attained and
the solid, which is formed from the liquid layer enriched in Batoms, is the same as the
liquid drawn into this layer. At this time, the temperature at the interface must be T3, as
shown in Fig. 14.24A. The composition as a function of distance along the mold is shown
in Fig. 14.25. This ﬁgure corresponds to the time when the steady-state freezing process
has just been attained. A similar illustration is found in Fig. 14.25B, but pertains to a later
time when the interface has moved farther to the right. Notice that, in both cases, the
composition of the solid rises from its original value ato that of the original liquid b. At
the interface there is also a sudden rise in composition to the value eas one passes from14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 433

nentially back to the value of the original liquid, which is b. The shape of the composition-
distance curve in this exponential region is a function of the rate of freezing and the
atomic diffusion rates in the liquid. It is important to note that in the above discussion it
is implied that there are no liquid convection currents. In the presence of such currents
it is not possible to attain as large a concentration of Batoms in advance of the interface.
There are other factors that may also limit the magnitude of the composition change in
the liquid at the interface. However, for our purposes we can assume that the distance-
composition curves shown in Fig. 14.25 are representative of what can actually happen
under similar conditions during the freezing of an alloy. The equations describing the
composition-distance curves in the solid and liquid can be found elsewhere.33
14.12 THE SCHEIL EQUATION
The one-dimensional freezing problem has also been considered by several authors34–36for
freezing under normal conditions. From this has come a signiﬁcant relationship, the Scheil
equation or the nonequilibrium lever rule. Several important assumptions are made in its
derivation. First, diffusion of the solute does not occur in the solid; second, in the liquid the
diffusion of the solute is rapid and complete; and third, the solid and liquid across the inter-
face are in local equilibrium. The ﬁrst assumption requires that the composition of the freez-
ing solid vary continuously as the freezing front advances and that the solid retain this
compositional variation after the front has passed. On the other hand, because of complete
diffusion in the liquid, the liquid composition is always uniform, although this uniform
composition changes as freezing continues. The physical bases for these assumptions about
the diffusion in the liquid and the solid come from the fact that the diffusion rate is nor-
mally several orders of magnitude greater in the liquid than in the solid and the mass trans-
port in the liquid is further aided by convective mixing. The Scheil equation is normally
derived using an idealized eutectic phase diagram, such as that in Fig. 14.26, where the
liquidus and solidus are assumed to be straight lines. At any temperature, Ti, the linear liq-
uidus and solidus lines give the solid and liquid compositions. These compositions are
assumed to be in equilibrium at the freezing front, linearly related to each other by the14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 434

solute concentrations by weight in the solid and liquid, respectively. Finally, it is assumed
that any difference between the molar volumes of the liquid and solid can be ignored.
Now let fsrepresent the fraction by weight of the solid in the alloy. The corresponding
liquid fraction is (1 /H11002fs). When a small increment of the solid, dfs, freezes, a quantity of
the solute equal to Csdfsis transferred from the liquid to the solid. However, since the con-
centration of the solute in the solid is less than that in the liquid, the liquid will have its
solute concentration increased by an amount:
dCl/H11005(Cl/H11002Cs)dfs/(1/H11002fs) 14.25
Using the relation Cs/Cl/H11005kfrom the phase diagram, this equation reduces to:
dCl/Cl/H11005(1/H11002k)/H11080dfs/( 1/H11002fs) 14.26
Equation 14.26 is now integrated using the boundary conditions existing at the initi-
ation of freezing; namely fs/H110050 and Cl/H11005Co. This yields:
Cl/H11005Co(1/H11002fs)(k/H110021)14.27
or in terms of the solute concentration in the solid
Cs/H11005kCo(1/H11002fs)(k/H110021)14.28
Equation 14.28 gives Cs, the concentration of the solid that freezes at the interface.
This concentration increases as the interface advances along the mold. The average com-
position of the solid also changes as the freezing progresses. A schematic curve showing
the variation of this average composition is given by the curved dashed line to the left of14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 435

the solidus line in Fig. 14.26. Note that in this non-equilibrium freezing process, solidiﬁ-
cation continues to a much lower temperature than it does in equilibrium freezing, which
is at the solidus temperature (see Fig. 14.26). Normally the freezing continues down to the
eutectic temperature. When the eutectic temperature is reached, the remaining liquid will
have the eutectic composition, and it freezes to form eutectic solid. Thus, the solid result-
ing from this non-equilibrium freezing normally will contain eutectic in its microstruc-
ture. The variation of the solid composition, Cs, with fraction solidiﬁed, fs, in this non-
equilibrium freezing is shown in Fig. 14.27. The amount of eutectic can be calculated using
Eq. 14.27 and letting Clequal Ce, where Ceis the composition of the eutectic.
It should be noted that in most solidiﬁcation processes, the extent of the segregation
is usually less than that calculated using the Scheil equation. This is because of solid-
state diffusion and the depression of the temperature at the dendrite tip.37Moreover, in
practice, the actual redistribution coefﬁcient deviates from the equilibrium value calcu-
lated from the phase diagram and becomes dependent on the solidiﬁcation velocity. At
sufﬁciently rapid solidiﬁcation rates, the value of kbecomes equal to unity since the
solute atoms do not have time to move away from the interface and they become

14.13 DENDRITIC FREEZING IN ALLOYS
Dendritic freezing is a common phenomenon in many alloy systems. Here the supercool-
ing that furnishes the driving force for dendritic growth is normally of a different type. The
form discussed in Sec. 14.10 is called thermal supercooling and can also be a factor in the
freezing of alloys, but constitutional supercooling, which we shall now consider, following
in general the proposals of Rutter and Chalmers,39is of much greater importance.
Constitutional supercooling results when a solid freezes with a composition different from
that of the liquid from which it forms.
For the sake of the present argument, let us assume that we can neglect considera-
tions of convection currents and other complicating factors and that the steady-state com-
position variation shown in Fig. 14.25 holds. In most practical examples of freezing, liquid
metal is poured into a mold cavity and freezes as a consequence of heat losses through the
mold shell. As a result, the temperature is always lowest at the mold walls and rises toward
the center of the mold. Solidiﬁcation, accordingly, starts at the walls and proceeds inward.
Applying these considerations to the present problem signiﬁes that we should concentrate
our attention on a freezing process in which the temperature rises in advance of the liquid-
solid interface. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 14.28, where the temperature of the liq-
uid is assumed to rise linearly with distance from the interface. A second curve in the
ﬁgure shows the freezing point of the liquid alloy as a function of distance from the inter-
face. This varies with distance from the interface due to the change in composition of the
liquid as one moves away from the interface. At the interface, the freezing temperature,
as shown in Fig. 14.23, is T3, but away from the interface it at ﬁrst rises rapidly and then
levels off to the temperature T1, the temperature at which the bulk of the liquid will begin
to freeze. As shown in Fig. 14.28, the temperature of the liquid and the freezing point of
the liquid intersect at two points: at the interface, and at the distance xfrom the interface.
The pertinent point, however, is that within the distance xthe liquid lies at a temperature
below its freezing point. Inside this range it is effectively supercooled in spite of the fact

FIG. 14.29 When the region of consti-
tutional supercooling is narrow, a
cellular structure may form as the
result of the movement of a stable
interface of the type shown abovethat the temperature gradient is positive. This is the direct result of the concentration gra-
dient in the liquid alloy in front of the interface.
Whether or not true dendritic freezing, with its associated shooting out of branches of
primary and higher order, occurs when the liquid in advance of the interface is constitu-
tionally supercooled depends on the amount of the supercooling. In large commercial cast-
ings, the supercooled layer (distance xin Fig. 14.28) is usually large because of a low
temperature gradient ahead of the interface and/or a low freezing rate, and dendritic freez-
ing is important. On the other hand, if the supercooled layer is thin, the growth of fully
developed dendrites is not possible because of the limited depth of the supercooled layer
into which they can grow. In this case, the instability of the interface may result in the for-
mation of a surface composed of more or less oval projections of the type shown in
Fig. 14.29. Because the movement of an interface of this type is coupled with the forward
motion of the narrow supercooled region, its shape is stable. This leads to a very interest-
ing result. In order for the surface to maintain its shape, freezing must occur uniformly
over the entire surface. However, the solid lying on the surface at the centers of the pro-
jections, which are farthest to the right, lies at a temperature ( T1) higher than that at the
cusps ( T2), which are farthest to the left. Coupled with this temperature difference is a dif-
ference in the composition of the liquid that freezes at the two positions. That which solid-
iﬁes at the cusps has a higher concentration of solute than that at the center of the
projections. The result of this freezing process is the formation of a cellular structure in
which the cell walls (horizontal lines in Fig. 14.29) are deﬁned as regions of high-solute
concentration. Figure 14.30 shows an actual photograph taken normal to the interface of
one of these cellular structures. Notice that what one sees in this ﬁgure is the surface of a
single crystal which is not uniform in composition; the dark lines represent areas of
increased solute concentration.

face. 100X. (Rutter, J.W., ASM Seminar, Liquid Metals and Solidiﬁca-

439 14.14 Freezing of Ingots
The cellular structure discussed above is noteworthy, for it shows how a nonuniform
solute distribution can be obtained on a scale smaller than the crystal size. In general, this
type of phenomenon is called micro-segregation . This is only one aspect of the segregation
problem that occurs during the freezing of alloys. In a later part of this chapter the impor-tant subject of segregation in alloy castings will be considered in more detail.
As may be seen in Fig. 14.28, the curves showing the liquidus point and the temper-
ature gradient are drawn so that they only coincide at two points; this leads to constitu-tional supercooling. A planar interface under this condition is unstable and leads to theformation of cells or dendrites. On the other hand, if the temperature in the liquid risesfaster (corresponding to a steeper temperature gradient) than that of the liquidus point,the planar interface would be stable and no dendrites will form. A planar interface is desir-able for growing single crystals. The constitutional supercooling criterion for the stabilityof a planar interface during steady-state solidiﬁcation can be written
40as:
GL/R/H11005mlCo(1/H11002k)/kDl14.30
where GLis the temperature gradient in the liquid, Ris the solidiﬁcation rate, mlis the
slope of the liquidus, Cois the alloy composition, kis the redistribution coefﬁcient, and DL
is the liquid diffusivity. For most solidiﬁcation processes, Eq. 14.30 can be used to deter-mine whether or not an interface will remain stable. However, for some solidiﬁcationprocesses, particularly for rapid solidiﬁcation, the criterion can lead to erroneous results.This is because the constitutional supercooling criterion ignores the temperature gradientin the solid and the solid-liquid surface energy. The constitutional supercooling criterionalso ignores the inﬂuence of surface energy on the stabilization of the interface. For thesecases it would be more accurate to use the morphological stability criterion developed byMullins and Sekerka,
41which will not be considered here.
14.14 FREEZING OF INGOTS
The casting of ingots is a very important step in the manufacture of wrought products:items such as plates and beams which are plastically worked into their ﬁnal shape. The sizeof these castings depends on the type of metal and its eventual use. In the manufacture ofsteel, large ingots, weighing 6 to 8 metric tons, are common.
When an ingot is frozen, three separate phases of the freezing process may occur,
with each phase developing a characteristic arrangement of grain sizes and shapes. Thebasic structures are illustrated in Fig. 14.31. In a narrow band following the contour ofthe mold lies the “chill zone,” consisting of small equiaxed (equal-sized) grains whichusually have random orientations. Inside of this outer zone, the grains become largerin size, elongated in shape, and with their lengths parallel to the heat-ﬂow direction(normal to the mold walls). These grains have a very strong preferred orientation witha direction of dendritic growth parallel to their long axis. Because of the shape of thecrystals in this zone, it is customary to call it the columnar zone . The last zone lies at
the center of the ingot and represents the last metal to freeze. In this region the grainsare again equiaxed and of random orientation, but are much larger than the grains inthe chill zone.
The factors
42instrumental in developing the above structures will now be considered.
First take the case of a pure metal. When liquid metal is poured into a mold, the moldwalls, which are at a much lower temperature (usually room temperature) than the 14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 439

FIG. 14.31 A section through a large ingot, and the three basic zones
of freezing that may be found in a casting
liquid, rapidly cool the layer of liquid with which they are in contact. As a result, the tem-
perature of the liquid metal for a short distance away from the mold walls drops below the
equilibrium freezing temperature. Because of the rapidity with which the liquid tempera-
ture falls, a considerable magnitude of supercooling usually results. When nucleation
(usually heterogeneous) occurs, its rate will be relatively rapid, with the result that the
average size of the grain of this solid will be small. Because the crystals form independ-
ently, their orientation will be random. Finally, because their growth is limited by similar
neighboring crystals nucleated at approximately identical times, their sizes will be nearly
uniform and the structure is said to be equiaxed .
The crystals in the chill zone develop through both nucleation and growth. Crystal
nuclei form in the liquid and grow in size until they make contact with neighboring crys-
tals. The columnar zone forms in a different manner. Here crystal growth predominates
and very little nucleation is observed. As soon as nucleation starts in the chill zone, the
temperature in this region begins to rise again toward the equilibrium freezing tempera-
ture. This is the natural result of the release of the latent heat of fusion.
The columnar zone is thus composed of crystals that start at the chill zone and grow
side by side in one direction, the heat-ﬂow direction. In a pure metal, these crystals may
continue to grow in this manner to the center of the ingot. Their growth stops when they
meet the grains growing out from the opposite wall. The central equiaxed zone shown in
Fig. 14.31 is not found in pure metal ingots. It is, however, a phenomenon commonly
observed in the freezing of alloys. While it would appear that dendritic growth occurs
only brieﬂy during the freezing of pure metals, it has been proposed by Walton and
Chalmers42that the preferred orientation found in the columnar zone results from the
dendritic freezing phase. At the start of dendritic freezing, those crystals on the interface
(chill zone) which possess a direction of rapid dendritic growth nearly normal to the
interface will, in general, shoot out their spikes more rapidly than their less favorably ori-
ented neighbors. The growth of these latter is also adversely affected by the heat of fusion
released by the more rapidly growing crystals. In this manner, certain crystals are sup-
pressed while others continue to grow in size, with the end result that only those crys-
tals survive that have dendritic-growth directions nearly parallel to the heat-ﬂow14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 440

FIG. 14.32 The development of the constitutional supercooled region at the
center of an alloy ingot that produces the central equiaxed zone of the ingotdirection. The general nature of the development of the preferred orientation is shown
schematically in Fig. 14.31. Notice that as the columnar grains grow in length there is also
an increase in their diameter. This is, above all, the result of the elimination of less favor-
ably oriented crystals. Still, there is other evidence that grain coarsening in ingots can
arise from other causes, such as the grain-boundary movements that would be due to
grain-boundary surface-energy factors.
When a pure metal freezes in a mold, the supercooling promoting dendritic growth
can only be of the thermal form. In alloys, on the other hand, in addition to the thermal
supercooling, one has the possibility of producing constitutional supercooling. When this
occurs, dendritic freezing is also observed and with it a corresponding development of a
preferred orientation. The resulting preferred orientation is of the same type as that dis-
cussed above with a dendritic-growth direction in each columnar grain parallel to the
heat-ﬂow direction. The mechanism by which dendritic growth in alloy castings eliminates
the less favorably oriented crystals differs42somewhat from that in pure metals, but need
not concern us here.
One important result of constitutional supercooling in alloys is that it favors the
development of the central equiaxed zone. As the solid-liquid interfaces that start
from opposite sides of a mold approach each other at the center of a large ingot, their
respective zones of constitutional supercooling eventually overlap. This is shown
schematically in Fig. 14.32. The left-hand figure represents an early stage in the
freezing process, while the right-hand figure represents a later stage when the zones
have come together. At this point, a very large supercooling can occur in the liquid
near the center of the ingot. There are two basic causes for this. First, the concentra-
tion of solute in the liquid just ahead of the interface tends to increase with increas-
ing growth of the columnar zone, thus requiring lower and lower temperatures at the
interface for continued solidification. Second, the temperature at the center of the
ingot tends to approach that of the interfaces as the latter get closer together. This
effectively flattens out the contour of the temperature-distance curve in the liquid.
When a central equiaxed zone appears in an ingot, it is indicative of the fact that con-
stitutional supercooling may have occurred in this region and that it was able to14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 441
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 442
develop to the point where nucleation could occur in the liquid at the center of the
casting. Crystallization in this central zone may occur, therefore, through the appear-
ance and growth of new crystals, and not through the continued growth of the elon-
gated crystals of the columnar zone.
One other point is worth noting, relative to the formation of the central zone of
an ingot. When nuclei form in this region, the heat of fusion that they release raises
the temperature in the immediate surroundings of each nucleus. Each new crystal is
thus surrounded by a temperature field and, as a result, begins its growth dendriti-
cally. However, since they form freely in the liquid, dendrite arms will shoot out along
all the directions of dendrite growth. In a cubic crystal, arms form along all of the six
/H20855100 /H20856directions, as shown schematically in Fig. 14.33. Notice that geometrical consid-
erations are such, in this case, that tertiary branches can form on the second-order
branches.
Dendritic growth in the central zone only continues until the heat of fusion removes
the constitutional supercooling. When this happens, freezing is completed by the ﬁlling in
of the spaces between the dendrite arms and between neighboring crystals.
It should be mentioned that grain nucleation, as a result of constitutional super-
cooling, is just one way that the equiaxed grains can form at the center of an ingot.
Another way they can form is by grain multiplication, which will be described in the
next section.

14.15 THE GRAIN SIZE OF CASTINGS
A detailed description of the factors in freezing that determine the ﬁnal grain size of a cast-
ing is beyond our scope. Cole and Bolling43have summarized many of them in a paper
that has particular reference to techniques used to obtain small grain sizes, primarily in theequiaxed central zone of a casting. Under the right conditions, this zone can become quitelarge. There are a number of signiﬁcant reasons why it is desirable to produce castings witha very ﬁne grain size. For example, it has been found that superplasticity (see Chapter 23)occurs primarily as a result of a very ﬁnely divided structure.
There are two basic ways of increasing the number of grains in a casting. One involves
increasing the basic nucleation rate, while the other depends on breaking up the dendritesas they grow so as to form additional crystal seeds. This latter is called grain multiplication .
Rapid cooling, as in die casting and casting into small cold molds, tends to increase thenucleation rate. It can also increase grain multiplication because of the enhanced convec-tion currents associated with this type of casting. The nucleation rate can also be increasedby adding catalysts (inoculants) to the melt. These inoculants are normally small, second-phase particles that increase the rate of heterogeneous nucleation. For example, boron andtitanium are often added to aluminum alloys to increase nucleation. These elements can beconsidered to react with the aluminum in the alloy to form particles that act as catalysts.
Of the two basic methods of decreasing the grain size, the one of most general appli-
cation is grain multiplication. This process probably occurs in most casting operations. Asthe dendrite arms grow and branch out, there is a continual release of the heat of fusion.This heat release, under the right conditions, can produce local melting and cause somedendrite arms to neck and pinch off. When this occurs, a small crystal fragment is formed.Agitation of the liquid metal due to convection currents tends to remove these crystallitesfrom the liquid-solid interface and distribute them throughout the liquid. Many of themmay eventually melt, but others grow into new, randomly-oriented crystals.
Artiﬁcial means can be employed to increase grain multiplication. In general, these
involve fragmenting the growing dendrites at the growing liquid-solid interface and caus-ing them to be redistributed throughout the melt by a forced ﬂuid ﬂow. Forced vibrations,alternating magnetic ﬁelds, ultrasonic vibrations, and a number of other methods may beused for this purpose. An effective method
43involves the oscillation of a mold through
several revolutions, followed by a change in the direction of rotation. This not only pro-motes the detachment of dendrite arms, but also causes them to be rather uniformly dis-tributed throughout the liquid as a result of the agitation of the liquid.
14.16 SEGREGATION
The liquids that are frozen to form industrial alloys usually contain, in addition to soluteelements added intentionally for their beneﬁcial effects, many impurity elements that ﬁndtheir way into the liquid metal by a number of different routes. Thus, impurity elements,present in the ores from which the basic metals were obtained, are frequently only partlyeliminated during the smelting and reﬁning operations. The refractory brick linings of fur-naces used in melting or reﬁning (purifying) and the gases in the furnace atmospheresmay be other sources. In the latter case, elements enter the liquid metal in the form of dis-solved gases. The various elements dissolved in commercial liquid metals can and often doreact with each other to form compounds (oxides, silicates, sulﬁdes, etc.). In many cases,the latter may be less dense than the liquid, and rise to the surface and join the slag which14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 443
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 444
ﬂoats on top of the liquid metal. On the other hand, it is quite possible for small impurity
particles (compounds) to exist in the liquid. Certain of the latter undoubtedly form nucle-ation centers for heterogeneous nucleation. This fact has been used to some extent to con-trol the grain size of castings by inoculating liquid metals with elements that combine toform nucleation catalysts. Increasing the number of nucleation centers will, of course, pro-duce a ﬁner grain size in the solidiﬁed casting.
When an alloy is frozen, a more or less general rule which applies is that solute ele-
ments, whether present as alloying elements or as impurities, are more soluble in the liq-uid state than in the solid state. This fact usually leads to a segregation of the solute elementsin the ﬁnished casting. There are two basic ways of looking at the resulting nonuniformityof the solute. First, because the liquid becomes progressively richer in the solute as freezingprogresses, the solute concentrations in a casting tend to rise in those regions that solidifylast (center of the ingot). This and similar long-range composition ﬂuctuations fall in theclassiﬁcation of macrosegregation. In general, macrosegregation refers to the change in theaverage composition of the metal as one moves from place to place in an ingot. Segregationof this form is not always caused by the selective freezing out of high-melting-point con-stituents. Gravitational effects are often a factor in producing macrosegregation, especiallyduring the formation of the central equiaxed zone. The crystals that form freely in the liq-uid often have a different density from that of the liquid. As a result, they may either risetoward the surface of the casting, or settle toward the bottom. An extreme example
44of
gravity-induced segregation occurs in an alloy system somewhat different from the solid-solution alloys presently being considered. Thus, in the lead-antimony system, an eutecticforms at 11.1 percent Sb and 252°C. When alloys containing more than 11.1 percent Sb(say 20 percent) are frozen, crystals of almost pure antimony form from the liquid until thecomposition of the latter reaches the eutectic composition, at which time the eutectic mix-ture begins to freeze. Since antimony crystals have a lower density than the liquid fromwhich they originate, they tend to rise toward the surface. Slow cooling of this alloy, there-fore, results in a structure whose lower fraction is composed almost entirely of eutecticsolid, with an upper portion containing the primary-alpha antimony crystals with someeutectic solid ﬁlling in the gaps between the primary crystals.
In castings not only do we ﬁnd composition variations (macrosegregation) over large
distances, but it is also possible to have localized composition variations on a scale smallerthan the crystal size. This is called microsegregation and one form has already been described;
the composition segregation associated with the cellular structure resulting from the com-bined movement of the liquid-solid interface and a very narrow zone of constitutionalsupercooling. A much more frequent form of microsegregation, commonly known ascoring , is caused by dendritic freezing in alloys. The original dendrite arms, which shoot out
into the liquid metal, freeze as relatively pure metal. The liquid surrounding these arms is,accordingly, enriched in solutes and normally, when this liquid solidiﬁes, the spacesbetween the arms become regions high in solute concentration.
Dendritic segregation, or coring, is very common in alloy castings solidiﬁed under nor-
mal conditions. It can occur with a solute concentration as low as 0.01 percent under theproper conditions. Rapid solidiﬁcation, however, can drastically reduce segregation and insome cases lead to its total elimination. When a casting is sectioned and the surface preparedfor metallographic examination, the exposed surface will usually be a planar section cuttingthrough the forest of dendrite arms. Since the composition at the center of an arm differs fromthat at points midway between arms, the dendrite arms can be revealed by etching with asuitable metallographic etch. Dendritic segregation in a copper-tin alloy is shown in Fig. 14.34.14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 444

arms have different orientations in each crystal. 200X
14.17 HOMOGENIZATION
The segregation of the solute due to coring can usually be removed if the equilibrium
structure of the alloy is a single phase. This is accomplished by a heat treatment known asa homogenizing anneal . In this process, the metal is heated to a high temperature for a suf-
ﬁcient time to allow diffusion to homogenize the structure.
Before considering the kinetics of homogenization, the freezing process that leads to cor-
ing will be re-examined. Fig. 14.35 shows one corner of an isomorphous phase diagram. Ifa metal of composition xis frozen under equilibrium conditions, the solid will follow the
solidus curve from point bto point c. This curve represents both the composition of the solid
that is forming at any instant and the average composition of all the solid that has previouslyformed. In normal freezing there is insufﬁcient time for diffusion to homogenize the struc-ture, and coring results. In this case, the solidus line from point bto point frepresents only
the composition of the solid that can form at any given temperature. Since the metal thathas solidiﬁed earlier is always richer in component Athan the solid that is just freezing, the
average composition of the solid has to lie to the left of the solidus line. The average compo-sition of the solid during normal freezing, therefore, follows a line such as bein Fig. 14.35.
At the same time, because there is always some diffusion, the composition of the ﬁrst solidto form (at the center of the dendrite arms) also changes and follows a path such as bd.
Note that one of the signiﬁcant features of normal freezing is that it tends to occur
over a greater temperature range than required for equilibrium freezing. Thus, point d,
which represents the end of the normal freezing process in Fig. 14.35, lies well below pointc, corresponding to the completion of equilibrium freezing.
At the end of normal freezing the composition will vary over the range from point b
to fin the phase diagram of Fig. 14.35. For the purpose of deriving an equation, it will
now be assumed that the dendrites can be considered as a set of parallel plates whose14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 445

composition varies linearly and periodically through this composition range, as indicated
in Fig. 14.36. The horizontal dashed line in this ﬁgure represents the average composition
of the alloy nBav. At the center of each dendrite arm, such as at point m, the composition
is less than the average by the amount /H9004nB, and midway between the dendrite arms, as at
point n, it is greater than the average by /H9004nB. The distance from the center of a dendrite
arm to a point midway between a pair of arms is assumed to equal l. This quantity is equal
to one-half the dendrite arm spacing, the distance between the centers of the two arms.
In a time interval dt, the concentration at point mmay be assumed to increase by /H9004nB,
while at point nit should decrease by the same amount. In order for this to happen, a
number of Batoms equal to

has to pass through the cross-section aa, where d(/H9004nB)l/H208622 is the area of the small cross-
hatched triangles in Fig. 14.36, and Ais the cross-section area of the specimen. This num-
ber can be equated to JAdt, where Jis the ﬂux in atoms/s /H11080m2. Since the concentration

A somewhat better approximation is to assume that the concentration varies sinusoidally
with the distance rather than linearly. Figure 14.37 shows this type of variation, which
corresponds45to a relaxation time τ/H11005l2/p2Dinstead of l2/4D.
As demonstrated in Sec. 13.3, the relaxation time is equal to the time required to
make a function that depends exponentially on the time decrease in value by a factor 1/ e.
In a typical cored specimen, the dendrite arm spacing may be of the order of 10/H110024m or

cases, equal to about 10/H1100213m2/s. Using these values gives a relaxation time

This result clearly shows that for a relatively coarse dendrite arm spacing, a very long
annealing time may be required in order to approach complete homogenization.
When only a single phase is present, it may not be of major importance whether or
not complete homogenization is attained. However, if coring yields a second nonequilib-
rium phase, this may not be true. This is particularly the case in a number of precipitation
hardening alloys. As an example, consider the alloy of aluminum with 4 percent copper.
If equilibrium is maintained during freezing, this alloy will freeze as a homogeneous solid
solution. In practice, equilibrium is never attained and the metal becomes badly cored. The
aluminum side of the aluminum-copper phase diagram is shown in Fig. 14.38. During
freezing, the average composition of the solid of a 4 percent copper alloy should move
along a line such as bc. Point clies on the eutectic isotherm. When the alloy is cooled to

the dendrite arms. The liquid has the eutectic composition and will freeze to form an
eutectic composed of the alpha and theta phases. The amount of eutectic may be
computed with Eq. 14.27. Sometimes when an eutectic forms and the primary phase (in
this example the alpha phase) occurs as a widely distributed set of closely spaced dendrite
arms, the corresponding phase ( a) in the eutectic may form preferentially on the existing
primary dendrites. This leaves the second phase ( u) as the only remaining visible phase in
the eutectic. When this occurs, the eutectic is said to be a divorced eutectic .
In any case, precipitation hardening alloys, such as the aluminum–4 percent copper
alloy, can develop a two-phase structure as a result of coring. This is undesirable for sev-
eral reasons. First, it ties up a large fraction of the hardening agent (the copper) in the pre-
cipitate where it is not available for strengthening the metal during a precipitation
hardening treatment. Second, as will be shown in Chapter 21 on fracture, precipitates can
have a harmful effect on the ductility of a metal. Homogenizing a cored precipitation hard-
ening alloy of this type will increase not only its strength, but also its ductility. This is
clearly demonstrated in Fig. 14.39, where the tensile and yield strengths, as well as the
elongation, of a commercial aluminum alloy are plotted as a function of the volume frac-
tion of the second phase in the alloy.
Considerable attention is currently being devoted to attempts to develop casting tech-
niques that will reduce the dendrite arm spacing. This is because the relaxation time for
homogenization varies as the square of the dendrite arm spacing. The closer the dendrite
arms, the easier it is to remove the second phase by homogenization. The gains to be
achieved in precipitation hardening alloys by removing the second phase are clearly shown
in Fig. 14.39. The most important factor in determining the dendrite arm spacing is the rate
of cooling. Very rapid cooling can produce a dendrite arm spacing of a few microns. For
most alloys, the dendrite arm spacing (DAS) is related46to the cooling rate, /H9255, by

where kis a constant and nis in the range of 1/3 to 1/2. Other factors that lead to a reduc-
tion in the time required for homogenization cannot be covered here. Information about
them is given in several papers.46,47
Finally, on the subject of homogenization, it should be mentioned that care should be
exercised in selecting the temperature for the homogenization anneal. Partial melting orliquation of the metal may occur if it is heated to just under the solidus curve of an equi-librium diagram. Coring normally allows part of the structure to freeze at a temperaturebelow that corresponding to the completion of freezing under equilibrium conditions. Thispart of the structure will melt if the metal is reheated to just below the solidus. In somecases, serious damage to a metal object may result from this cause.
14.18 INVERSE SEGREGATION
Dendritic freezing in the columnar zone of ingots may sometimes lead to a phenomenonknown as inverse segregation . In the normal freezing of ingots, the center and top portions of
the ingot, which freeze last, become richer in solutes than the outer portions of the ingot,which freeze ﬁrst. In some alloys, however, the dendrite arms may extend for long distancesbefore the spaces between them are ﬁlled in by the freezing operation. Under the proper con-ditons, channels between the dendrite arms offer a path by which liquid from the center ofthe casting can work its way back toward the surface. The latter phenomenon is promoted bythe fact that as solidiﬁcation progresses, the casting as a whole can shrink away from the moldwalls, causing a suction that pulls the liquid toward the surface. Other important factors arethe internal pressure that develops in an ingot due to gas evolution during freezing and con-vective currents developed in the liquid. “Tin sweat,” which occurs in tin bronzes (copper-tinalloys), is an example. When the liquid contains a relatively large concentration of dissolvedhydrogen, the release of this gas near the end of freezing forces the liquid enriched in tinthrough interdendritic pores to the surface, where it coats the normally yellow-bronze-colored surface with a ﬁne layer of white alloy (containing approximately 25 percent Sn).
14.19 POROSITY
Other than shrinkage cracks resulting from unequal cooling rates in different sections ofcastings, there are two basic causes for porosity in cast metals: gas evolution during freez-ing, and the shrinkage in volume that accompanies the solidiﬁcation of most metals.
Gases differ from other solutes in that their solubility in metals depends markedly on
the applied pressure. Many gases with which metals come in contact are diatomic: O
2, N2,
H2, etc. Providing that the solubility is small, it is often possible to express the relationship
between the pressure and the solubility of diatomic gases in a simple form, known asSievert’s law.

gand coordinates) both above and
below the melting point. This signiﬁes that Sievert’s law is probably valid for the solutionof hydrogen in both liquid and solid magnesium.vpcg/H11005kvp14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 450

The solubility of gases in metals is also a function of temperature and, in most cases,
the solubility increases rapidly with temperature. If the maximum solubility is small, it is
often possible to express the equilibrium concentration of a gas in a metal, at a constant
gas pressure, as an exponential function of the type previously derived for the solubility of
carbon in iron; namely

where cgis the concentration of the gas in the metal, Bis a constant, Qis the work to intro-
duce a mole of gas atoms into the metal, and Rand Thave their usual signiﬁcance.
The solubility of hydrogen as a function of temperature in copper at a constant pres-
sure of one atmosphere is given in Fig. 14.41. This curve shows not only the rapid increase
in solubility with increasing temperature, but also a large decrease in solubility when the
metal transforms from a liquid to a solid at 1083°C. Similar changes in the solubility of
gases in metals occur at the freezing points of most metals. It can be concluded that, in
general, when a metal freezes, its ability to hold gases is strongly decreased.
Let us consider these factors in relation to the freezing process. In almost all cases, the
solubility of dissolved gases undergoes a large drop when metals freeze. For this reason,
gaseous solutes segregate during freezing in a similar fashion to other solutes. Segregation
signiﬁes, therefore, localized increases in the gas concentration of a liquid. Gas bubbles may
form in the liquid in those regions where the concentration of gas rises above the equilib-
rium concentration (saturation value). Homogeneous nucleation of bubbles, however,
requires a high degree of supersaturation for the same reason as the nucleation of solid crys-
tals in a liquid. In both cases, a surface with its inherent surface energy is formed between
the old and new phases. As a result, gas bubbles usually form heterogeneously and, in most
cases, the nucleation centers lie on the liquid-solid interface. Nucleation at the interface is
also furthered by the build-up in concentration of the gaseous solutes at both the general
interface and in between the dendrite arms as a result of segregation effects.14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 451
Chapter 14 Solidiﬁcation of Metals 452
A very important factor in gas-bubble formation is the local pressure in the liquid. As
previously mentioned, the equilibrium concentration of a gas in a liquid depends on the
pressure. In metals with a given quantity of absorbed gas, gas-bubble nucleation is there-fore promoted by a lowering of the pressure, and hindered by pressure increases. Thus, ifliquid metals are frozen under sufﬁciently high pressures, gas evolution may be prevented.In this respect, die castings are a form of casting in which small metal parts of close dimen-sional tolerances are manufactured by forcing liquid metals (under very high pressures)into steel dies. Gas porosity is effectively eliminated in this casting method. On the otherhand, it frequently happens that the normal shrinkage that occurs when a metal freezescauses pressure drops in the liquid. This situation may occur when the entire outer sur-face of a casting freezes over, leaving the liquid in the center surrounded by a shell of solidmetal. A similar effect may also happen in localized areas of complicated castings whereina small volume of liquid ﬁnds itself enclosed by solid. In either case, a vacuum maydevelop and, if it does, gas-bubble nucleation will be promoted.
Gas-bubble formation is a nucleation and growth phenomenon similar in many
respects to other nucleation and growth phenomena previously considered. In particular,as mentioned above, the formation of the interface makes it hard to nucleate bubbles.However, once a bubble has formed and grown to a size greater than its critical radius, itsgrowth becomes progressively easier. This fact is easily shown in the following manner. Agas bubble in a liquid is analogous to a soap bubble, except that it consists of a single liquid-gas interface separating a gas phase from a liquid phase. By analogy with the soap bubble,we may write
14.38
where gis the surface energy in dyne/cm, p
gis the internal pressure in the gas bubble in
dyne/cm2, plis the pressure in the liquid in dyne/cm2, and ris the radius of curvature of
the bubble in centimeters. As the bubble grows in size, its radius of curvature increases. Asa result, the pressure differential between the gas in the bubble and the pressure in the liq-uid falls. This implies (by Sievert’s law) that the bubble, as it grows in size, is able to be inequilibrium with a decreasing concentration of gas atoms in the surrounding liquid.Continued growth of gas bubbles is also furthered by the solute concentration gradient,which develops in the surrounding liquid as the gas bubble absorbs more and more gasatoms. The concentration falls toward the bubble, causing a diffusion of gas atoms fromthe surrounding liquid toward the bubble.
The effect of gas-bubble formation on the ﬁnal solid metal structure during freezing
depends upon whether or not the bubbles are trapped into the solid structure, and uponthe shape of the entrapped cavities. Rapidly growing bubbles have the tendency to freethemselves from the interface and rise toward the upper surface of the casting. If this sur-face is frozen over, a large cavity may form at the top of the ingot. If the upper surface isunfrozen, the gas is eliminated from the casting. In general, since gas bubbles that formnear the top of an ingot grow under a lower hydrostatic head, they will be larger in sizeand more inclined to escape. This action is further increased by the sweeping action ofbubbles that rise from points at greater depths in the mold.
When the growth rate is very slow, bubbles may be trapped by the solid growing
around them. In this case, the cavity formed in the solid is approximately spherical inshape and is commonly called a blowhole . See Fig. 14.42A. In some cases, blowholes maypg/H11002pl/H110052g
r14Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 452

not be particularly harmful to the properties of the metal. This is especially true in those
metals that receive a high degree of hot-working during their manufacture, providing that
the blowholes are formed at some distance below the surface of the ingot. This is required
in order that the internal surfaces of the blowholes do not become oxidized through con-
tact with oxygen from the surrounding air. If the surface of the blowhole is not oxidized,
it is often possible, under the extreme pressures of hot-rolling, to collapse the blowholes
and to weld their sides together. If the welds are successful, the blowholes are eliminated
from the metal and any gas remaining in the cavities is reabsorbed into the metal (now a
solid). Conversely, if the surfaces of the collapsed blowhole do not weld, a long slitlike
defect is formed in the metal, which is called a seam.
Wormhole porosity is another form of cavity defect that may be found in castings.
These are long tubular cavities produced when gas is evolved at an intermediate rate, so
that gas bubbles grow in length at the same rate that the liquid-solid interface moves. The
nature of wormhole porosity is shown in Fig. 14.42B, where it may be observed that the
holes are elongated in the heat-ﬂow direction. Wormhole porosity is easily observed in a
nonmetallic ingot familiar to almost everyone: a large cake of ice frozen in a commercial
icehouse from water containing dissolved air. The central whitish areas are usually regions
of wormhole porosity.
Porosity of a much ﬁner and more irregular shape than that described above occurs
when shrinkage effects and gas evolution combine. Thus, in regions completely enclosed by
solid metal which still contain some interdendritic liquid, pores can develop, which more
or less parallel the dendrite arms. If the pores form primarily as a result of shrinkage, they
will be very ﬁne in cross-section and very numerous. On the other hand, if gas evolution
occurs while the pores are forming, the cavities will be larger and less numerous.
Another form of interdendritic porosity may occur as a result of shrinkage effects
alone. When dendrites form during freezing, a network of small channels is formed
between the dendrite arms. When the liquid at the end of the network (roots of the den-
drites) freezes, shrinkage takes place, which sucks in the liquid. If the channels are narrow
and extensive, as is the case when the dendrites are fully developed, the liquid ﬂow is
restricted. As a result, small pores form near the roots of the dendrite arms.
While considering the subject of gas evolution, it is worth noticing that controlled-
gas evolution may sometimes be used to advantage. Thus, a very large percentage of the
steel manufactured in this country is poured into ingots while it still contains a relativelySolid

high but controlled amount of gas. This gas content is adjusted so that when the ingot
freezes enough, blowholes are trapped in the metal to compensate for the normal shrink-age of the metal as it freezes. In subsequent manufacturing stages (hot-rolling), the blow-holes are eliminated as discussed earlier. This form of ingot casting greatly simpliﬁes theproblems associated with the casting of large steel ingots and is called rimming . Rimming
is associated with a relatively high concentration of oxygen in the liquid steel that com-bines with some of the carbon dissolved in the steel to form carbon monoxide on freezing.This is the gas primarily associated with the formation of the blowholes. A high-oxygencontent in the steel unfortunately leads to a relatively high concentration of oxides, sili-cates, and similar particles in the ﬁnished product. In many instances, nonmetallic inclu-sions may not be particularly detrimental in a steel. However, the higher the demands onthe steel, the more detrimental are nonmetallic inclusions to the steel properties. Thus,high concentrations cannot be tolerated in highly stressed machinery steels.Furthermore, for steels containing more than about 0.3 percent carbon, it becomes verydifﬁcult to weld blowholes during the rolling processes, and high-quality steels and steelscontaining more than 0.3 percent carbon are usually deoxidized before casting. Thesedegassed steels freeze without gas evolution and are said to be killed . The principal factor
to be avoided in a killed-steel ingot is the formation of a large shrinkage cavity along thecentral axis of the casting, known as a pipe. A properly designed killed-steel ingot mold
must feed liquid metal into the central regions of the casting as freezing progresses. Thisis accomplished by placing risers (liquid metal resevoirs) or hot tops at critical locationsof the casting. The casting of ingots by this method is more expensive because the moldsare complicated and more costly.
14.20 EUTECTIC FREEZING
For solidiﬁcation of a pure metal with a planar interface at a supercooling, /H9004T, the free-
energy decrease is given by Eq. 14.18, which shows the energy decrease to be linearly pro-portional to the supercooling. A similar equation applies for the volume free-energychange for solidiﬁcation of an eutectic liquid. In this case, however, two phases, aand b,
form upon solidiﬁcation, and the total free-energy change includes not only the volumefree-energy change, but also the surface energy created between these phases, thus requir-ing an additional energy expenditure. In a simple “plate-like” lamellar eutectic, the bound-ary area created is proportional to 2/ lper m
3, where lis the eutectic spacing; see
Fig. 14.43. The corresponding free-energy increment per mole is 2 gabVm/l, where gabis
the surface energy of the a-bboundary and Vmis the molar volume of the eutectic. This
additional free energy that is needed to form the solid requires an additional driving forcefor freezing. Thus, the freezing of a lamellar eutectic cannot take place at its equilibriumfreezing temperature, T
e, and the liquid must be cooled below Tefor freezing to occur.
Accordingly, for a given lamellar spacing, l, the free-energy change for freezing becomes:
/H9004G(/H9261)/H11005/H11002 /H9004 G(l/H11009)/H110012gabVm/l 14.39
where /H9004G(l/H11009) is the bulk free-energy change when lis so very large that the interfacial
energy is negligible. /H9004G(l/H11009) is, of course, a function of the amount of the undercooling,
/H9004T0, and may be represented by the approximate relationship:
/H9004G(l/H11009)/H11005/H9004H/H9004T0/Te14.4014Ch14.qxd  11/6/08  8:01 PM  Page 454

primarily on the assumption that the interfaces between the liquid and the aand b
phases are very mobile. If the growth rate of the solid, R, does depend on the solute dif-
fusion, then it should be proportional to D/H11080dC/dl , where Dis the liquid diffusion coefﬁ-
cient and dC/dl is the effective concentration gradient of the solute in the liquid. The
problem is complex but it is possible to obtain a reasonable model for the growth process
by simply writing:
R/H11005kD/H11080/H9004C1/l 14.45
where Ris the growth rate, kis a constant of proportionality, Dis the average diffusivity,
/H9004C1is the difference between the solute concentration in front of an alamella and that in
front of a blamella, and lis the interlamellar spacing as deﬁned in Fig. 14.44. If one sub-
stitutes for /H9004C1in this growth rate equation using the relation in Eq. 14.44, and assumes
that, by Eq. 14.42, lmin/H11005B//H9004T0where B/H110052gabVmTe//H9004H, it follows that:
R/H11005kD/H11080/H9004C1max(1/H11002B/l/H9004T0) 14.46
For this latter equation, /H9004C1can be estimated by extrapolating the aand bliquidus
lines below the eutectic temperature as shown in Fig. 14.44A. On the basis of this ﬁgureone can assume that /H9004C

ing this relationship in Eq. 14.46 we have:

where A/H110051/kk1D. Solving for the undercooling, /H9004T0, in Eq. 14.47 yields
14.48
Equation 14.48 involves three variables— /H9004T0, l, and R—but only two are independ-
ent, so its solution requires an additional condition. This problem can be handled byassuming several constant values for the growth velocity, R, and then plotting correspon-
ding curves of /H9004T
0versus l, as shown schematically in Fig. 14.45 for three assumed
growth velocities. Note that each of these curves passes through a minimum. In addition,experimental data generally imply that the eutectic growth rate tends to seek a minimumundercooling.
If it is now assumed that growth occurs in such a manner that undercooling is a
minimum, then one has the condition that d/H9004T

perature recalesces to its melting point of 1356 K. The
speciﬁc heats of solid and liquid copper in the tempera-
ture range of interest are, respectively:

to solidify the entire sample adiabatically?
14.2 (a) Consider the face-centered cubic crystal struc-
ture and the planes (100), (110), and (111). On the basis
of the degree of close-packing associated with each plane,
rank these planes in order of their growth velocity during
freezing.(b) Also rank the (100), (110), and (111) planes for the
body-centered cubic lattice.
14.3 The dendrite arm spacing (DAS) is dependent on the
cooling rate, /H9255, by an equation of the form DAS /H11005k/H9255/H11002n.
Suppose for Al-4.9% Cu, DAS was measured as 100 and

niques which are commonly used to achieve rapid
cooling rates. Brieﬂy describe what these techniques are.
14.4 An Al-5% Cu ingot is unidirectionally solidiﬁed
under the conditions of no diffusion in the solid, com-
plete diffusion in the liquid, and local equilibrium at the
interface, so that the Scheil equation applies.
(a) Calculate the composition of the liquid when the
ingot is 50 percent solid. What is the average composition
of the solid?
(b) What is the interface temperature at this point?Flemings46shows a plot in which lplots linearly against R/H110021/2and uses experimental lead-
tin data taken from several sources. On the other hand, Fig. 14.47, from Hunt and Chilton49

14.5 Some eutectics grow as rod eutectics while others
grow as lamellar eutectics, as shown in the accompany-
ing ﬁgure. Suppose that for an eutectic, the weight frac-
tion of the aphase is faand for the bphase it is fband the
densities of aand bare the same.
(a) Calculate fafor the rod eutectic as a function of land ra,
where lis the rod spacing and rais the radius of the arods.

each eutectic, using ga/bfor the interface energy per
unit area.
(d) At what fawould both eutectics have the same inter-
facial energy?
(e) What type of eutectic structure do you expect for an
alloy in which the volume fraction of ais less than that

14.6 Assume that an alloy of nickel with 2 wt. percent
aluminum is cast and, by metallographic examination, a
dendrite arm spacing of 50 mis observed. It is also deter-
mined that the composition difference between the cen-
ter of an arm and the midpoint between two arms is
1 percent. Estimate the time required for homogenization
if the annealing temperature is to be 1400°C and the
composition difference is to be reduced to one-tenth of its
original value. Note: see Table 12.5.14.7 In a precipitation hardening alloy, coring usually
results in the precipitation of an eutectic between the
dendrite arms. With regard to aluminum-copper alloys,
Singh and Flemings50have assumed that this eutectic is
divorced (consists only of the uphase) and have derived
an equation to describe the kinetics of homogenization
that is similar to that discussed in the text for homoge-
nization of a cored solid solution alloy. This equation,
which applies to a solution treatment close to the
solvus, is
g/H11005g0e/H11002p2Dt/H208624l2

where gis the volume fraction of the uphase at time t,
g0is the volume fraction of uwhen tis zero, Dis the dif-
fusion coefficient, and l0is equal to half the dendrite
arm spacing, as shown in the schematic figure on the
next page. (Note that the concentration inside the pre-
cipitate is constant since it equals that of the uphase.
In the alpha phase, the concentration of copper is
assumed to vary sinusoidally with distance and to be a
minimum at the midpoint corresponding to the centers
of the dendrites.)
(a) Assuming that at the annealing temperature Dis
10/H1100214m2/s and that the original volume fraction of the u
phase is 1.0 percent, what solution time would be
required to obtain a volume fraction of 0.01 percent if the
dendrite arm spacing is 100 m?
(b) What would be the corresponding time if the dendrite
arm spacing was 10 m?

463Structural changes in metallic systems usually take place by nucleation and growth
whether a change in state, a phase change within one of the three states, or a simple struc-tural rearrangement within a single phase is involved. A number of examples have alreadybeen discussed and others will be covered in later chapters. In Sec. 5.2, the subject of thenucleation of dislocations was considered. In the broadest sense, the nucleation of disloca-tion loops and their growth during straining represent a structural change. Nucleation andgrowth during recrystallization are discussed in Sec. 8.13; in precipitation hardening inSec. 16.3 and 16.4, in solidiﬁcation in Sec. 14.2 and 14.3; in the formation of deformationtwins in Sec. 17.4 and 17.6; in martensite transformations in Sec. 17.25 and 17.26; and inthe eutectoid transformation of steel to form pearlite in Sec. 18.3 and 18.4.
Because metallurgical transformations depend so strongly on the processes of nucle-
ation and growth, this chapter will consider in greater detail the conditions controlling theformation of nuclei, their rate of formation, and the rate of their growth.
15.1 NUCLEATION OF A LIQUID FROM THE VAPOR
The simplest case that can be considered is that involving the formation of liquid dropletsin a vapor phase. There are a number of reasons why this is so. In an ordinary nucleationprocess, a small region of a new phase is created within another phase. Associated withsuch an event is the formation of a boundary separating the two phases. The nature of thisboundary is often difﬁcult to deﬁne when the newly formed particle is very small and con-tains very few atoms. Fortunately, the conditions controlling the formation of nuclei arenot normally sensitive to the properties of the particles when they are extremely small.There is always a critical particle size above which the particles become stable, and belowwhich they are unstable. Below this critical size the particles are normally called embryos ,
or clusters , and above it, nuclei . When an embryo has grown to approximately the critical
size, it is usually of sufﬁcient size that one can treat the particle as macroscopic. Thus, inthe region of primary interest, it is often possible to ignore the complications associatedwith very small groups of atoms and consider the nucleation problem from a simplemacroscopic point of view. It is worth noting that the formation of a solid crystallinenucleus from a vapor or a liquid is more complicated than the formation of a liquid dropletfrom its vapor. This has to do with the shape of the particle as it grows. In a crystal the sur-face energy may be a function of the orientation of the surface, and a crystal nucleus ofminimum surface energy may have a complicated shape. Furthermore, the growth of acrystal nucleus is also a more complicated process than the growth of a liquid droplet. Ina solid, the atoms have to ﬁt into the ﬁxed pattern of the crystal lattice. The problem ofattachment of atoms to the crystal surface has to consider this fact, and when the crystalgrows under a relatively low driving force, the growth may occur by the addition of atomsto steps on the crystal surface.

Liquid droplet 
Vapor 
FIG. 15.1 A liquid droplet in a vaporAnother simplifying factor in considering the nucleation of a liquid from a vapor
that also applies to the nucleation of crystals from either the vapor or liquid phases is
that the nucleation process does not involve strain energy. In solid-solid reactions, the
newly formed phase often does not ﬁt well into the matrix surrounding it, with the
result that both the nuclei and the matrix usually become strained.
Finally, with regard to vapor-liquid transformations, it may be mentioned that the
vapor phase itself is capable of being modeled in a relatively simple fashion using the con-
cept of the ideal gas and the kinetic theory of gaseous collisions.
The nucleation of liquid droplets in a vapor will not be treated in detail. However, the
basic principles and primary results will be covered. For a more extensive treatment, one
is referred to standard texts on transformation.1,2
There are two basic ways that a drop of liquid can form in a vapor. It can form at a
small foreign particle, such as a dust particle, in the vapor. In this case the formation of
the liquid droplet is made easier by the presence of the foreign particle and one has a typ-
ical case of heterogeneous nucleation . On the other hand, a droplet may result from a con-
centration ﬂuctuation of the atoms or molecules of the vapor. This would correspond to
homogeneous nucleation .
Homogeneous nucleation, in general, is difficult to obtain. For example, in the
freezing of a liquid to form a solid, which also involves nucleation and growth, het-
erogeneous nucleation is the rule rather than the exception. The nuclei of the solid
form at mold walls or impurity particles in the liquid itself. Thus, very pure water
does not freeze homogeneously until supercooled to temperatures of the order
of/H1100240°C (233 K).
Homogeneous nucleation is difficult because, when a second phase particle
forms, a surface is created between the particle and the matrix phase. This requires
positive energy and opposes the loss of energy associated with creating the volume
of the particle.
Accordingly, we may write the following equation to describe the formation of a liq-
uid droplet like that shown in Fig. 15.1:
/H9004G/H11005/H9004Gv/H11001/H9004Gg15.1
where /H9004Gis the free energy associated with the formation of the droplet, /H9004Gvis the free
energy associated with the volume of the droplet, and /H9004Ggis the energy of the surface that15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 464

FIG. 15.2 Free energy of a droplet of liquid as a function of its

energy depends on its volume we may write:
/H9004G/H11005A1r3/H11001A2r215.2
where A1and A2are constants and ris the droplet radius. Figure 15.2 is a plot of
Eq. 15.2. At small radii, the surface free energy, ( A2r2), is larger than the volume
free energy, ( A1r3), and the total free energy is positive. The situation changes, how-
ever, as the radius grows in size, so that with larger radii the free energy becomes
negative. The radius, r0, is known as the critical radius . Below this value a droplet
lowers its free energy by decreasing its size, so that droplets with radii smaller than
r0tend to disappear. On the other hand, droplets with radii larger than r0undergo15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 465
Chapter 15 Nucleation and Growth Kinetics 466
a decrease in free energy with increasing radius. For this reason they are stable and
should continue to grow.
Homogeneous nucleation requires that thermal ﬂuctuations produce droplets large
enough to exceed r0; otherwise the second phase cannot nucleate. Now we may also write
Eq. 15.2 in the form:

where /H9004gvlis the chemical free-energy change per atom associated with the transfer of
atoms from the vapor to the liquid phases, vlis the volume of an atom in the liquid phase,
ris the radius of the droplet, and gis the speciﬁc surface free energy. Two important
parameters are associated with the maximum in Fig. 15.2. The ﬁrst is the critical particleradius, r
0. A relation for r0may be obtained by setting the derivative of Eq. 15.3 to zero
and solving for r0. This yields
r0/H11005/H110022gvl//H9004gvl15.4
where r0is the critical radius, gthe speciﬁc surface energy, vlthe volume of a liquid
atom, and /H9004gvlthe free-energy difference between an atom in the vapor and liquid
phases. Note that in Fig. 15.2, /H9004gvlis assumed negative. On this basis, r0will be positive.
The second parameter is /H9004Gr0. If Eq. 15.4 is solved for /H9004gvl/vland the result is substi-
tuted into Eq. 15.3, one obtains
/H9004Gr0/H110054pgr2
o/3 15.5
where /H9004Gr0is the free energy of the nucleus at the maximum.
Equation 15.3 may also be written with the number of atoms, n, in the particle as the
independent variable (i.e., instead of rthe particle radius):
/H9004Gn/H11005/H9004gvln/H11001hgn2/315.6
where n/H11005(4/3) pr3/vland his a shape factor, which, if one assumes a sphere, equals
(3vl)2/3. A diagram showing the variation of all the terms in this equation, with nthe num-
ber of atoms, is shown in Fig. 15.3. Note that the free energy of the particle, /H9004Gn, passes
through a positive maximum and then decreases and eventually becomes negative.
In Fig. 15.3 it is assumed that the vapor is supersaturated. This is equivalent to assum-
ing that it lies at a position on a temperature-pressure diagram like point ain Fig. 15.4. At
this temperature and pressure, liquid is the stable phase and the chemical free energychange per atom, /H9004g
vl, is negative. On the other hand, if the vapor lies at point c, the vapor
phase is the stable phase and /H9004gvlis positive, and the free energy of the particle is always
positive and increases monotonically with the number of atoms, as shown in Fig. 15.5. Itis therefore evident that, in this case, there is no tendency for liquid droplets to continueto grow and to form large stable particles. This does not mean, however, that vapor atomscannot come together and combine to form a distribution of very small embryos. In thevapor, the random motion of the atoms causes local ﬂuctuations in concentration or den-sity. Certain of these ﬂuctuations may bring a sufﬁcient number of atoms close enoughtogether so that, in a small volume, the atoms may tend to arrange themselves in a struc-ture more characteristic of the liquid phase than of the vapor phase. Such a ﬂuctuation iscalled a heterophase ﬂuctuation . These are basically the sources from which embryos may be/H9004G/H110054/3 pr3/H9004gvl

observing an embryo of a given size containing natoms may be shown to be proportional
to e/H11002/H9004Gn/H20862kT, where /H9004Gnis the free energy increase associated with the formation of the par-
ticle. As a consequence, the numbers of particles containing natoms is given by
Nn/H11005Ce/H11002/H9004Gn/H20862kT15.7
where Nnis the number of these particles, /H9004Gnis the free energy required to form a particle,
Cis a slowly varying function of n, and kand Thave their usual signiﬁcance. To a reasonable
approximation, Cmay be assumed equal to N, the total number of atoms under considera-
tion, provided that the number of particles is small compared to N. We may therefore write
Nn/H11005Ne/H11002/H9004Gn/H20862kT15.8
Attention is now called to the similarity of this equation to Eq. 7.40, which gives the
equilibrium number of vacancies in a crystal. Equation 15.8 could be derived in an anal-
ogous fashion to that used in obtaining the vacancy equation.1To do this one needs to
consider the entropy of mixing associated with the division of atoms between the particles
of various sizes.15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 467
Chapter 15 Nucleation and Growth Kinetics 468
Let us now consider the variation of Nnwith n, as predicted by Eq. 15.8, when the
vapor phase is stable. For convenience, we shall consider that the vapor is very close to
being in equilibrium with the liquid phase, so that it lies nearly at point bin Fig. 15.4. In
this case, the change in chemical free energy per atom, on going from the vapor to the liq-
uid, is approximately zero, so that we may ignore the term containing /H9004gvlin the equation
for the free energy of the particle, which becomes
/H9004Gn/H11005hgn2/315.9
and
Nn/H11005Ne/H11002hgn2/3/kT
This latter expression can be easily evaluated using characteristic approximate values for
the various parameters. Those that are given roughly correspond to those for tin. Thus, let
us assume that g, the surface free energy, is 0.5 J/m2, the boiling temperature is 2550 K,
and the diameter of the atom in the liquid phase is 0.3 nm. In this case h, the geometrical
factor {(4 p)1/3(3vl)2/3}, is about 4.3 /H1100310/H1100219m2, and /H9004Gn/H110052.15 /H1100310/H1100219n2/3J. The corre-
sponding variation of /H9004Gnwith nis shown as the left graph in Fig. 15.6. The right diagram
corresponds to the variation of Nnwith n, assuming that the total number of atoms in the
assembly is that of one mole, or about 1024. Note that in this latter diagram semilogarith-
mic coordinates have been used. The normal procedure in demonstrating a curve of this
type is to use simple linear coordinates. However, as may be readily seen in Fig. 15.6, Nn
varies by over 20 orders of magnitude in the interval shown in the diagram. It is very difﬁ-
cult to represent this fact using a linear system of coordinates.
While Fig. 15.6 is basically qualitative, it does show several very interesting features.
First, the number of embryos is very large when the size of the embryo is small. Second,
as the size of the embryo increases or the value of nbecomes larger, the number of
embryos falls very rapidly. For the example given in Fig. 15.6, while there should be
about 1010embryos containing about 12 atoms in the assembly, there should be only
one embryo containing about 25 atoms. For any embryo larger than this there is only aFree energy

FIG. 15.6 The free energy of an embryo and the number of embryos per mole as a function of n, the number 
of atoms in an embryo, for a hypothetical metal vapor just above the boiling point of the metal
fractional chance of it existing. The signiﬁcant point is that in a stable assembly,
embryos varying through a wide range of sizes can exist. However, this situation is
dynamic. Individual embryos are constantly growing and shrinking in size as they
either add or lose atoms. Nevertheless, the distribution implied in Fig. 15.6 is stable.
Furthermore, it should be mentioned that there is no tendency for the larger embryos
to grow to form nuclei.
Now let us consider the supersaturated vapor corresponding to point ain Fig. 15.4.
Here the system is metastable. It wants to transform to the liquid state, but the liquid has
to be nucleated. The basic problem is how to represent the distribution of particles accord-
ing to their sizes, as was done for the stable state in Fig. 15.6. At this point we shall intro-
duce the symbol Znto represent the number of particles containing natoms in a metastable
assembly. It is equivalent to Nnin the stable assembly. We know that the larger embryos
have to grow to form nuclei. This implies, in effect, that there is a constant net rate of par-
ticle growth. In the stable state, since the number of embryos of any one size is ﬁxed, as
many of these embryos leave a size class as enter it. In the metastable state, more embryos
of a given size class will increase their size by gaining an atom than will decrease their size
by losing an atom in a given interval of time. The net result is a steady progression of
embryos that increase their sizes to eventually become nuclei. While this implies a basic
difference in the variation of Nnwith nfor the two cases, the earlier theories assumed that
in both cases the same relation holds, or that

The fact that above ncthis ﬁgure shows that /H9004Gndecreases and eventually becomes neg-
ative implies that given sufﬁcient time, the number of particles of very large size should
approach inﬁnity. This, of course, implies that the entire assembly would be effectively in
the liquid state. However, in most nucleation problems of interest, one normally starts
with a phase that has just been brought into the supersaturated condition. In the present15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 469

FIG. 15.7 The number of embryos as a function of the number of
atoms in an embryo for a system at point ain Fig. 15.4 according to
the Volmer-Weber theorycase this would signify a vapor that was originally at point Tcin Fig. 15.4 whose temper-
ature had been lowered to Ta. For this case, it was originally proposed by Volmer and
Weber3that the distribution of embryos might correspond to the solid curve shown in
Fig. 15.7. This curve is equivalent to the assumption that the distribution function is
determined by the variation of /H9004Gn(shown in Fig. 15.3) up to the critical embryo size
at nc. Above this value of nit is assumed that the particles grow rapidly and are effec-
tively removed from the problem. Thus, a nucleus can be considered to be formed
whenever an embryo of the critical size captures an additional atom. The rate of nucle-
ation would, therefore, be proportional to the number of critical-size embryos, Znc, and
the rate of condensation of vapor atoms on these embryos. The former quantity is given
by Ne/H11002/H9004Gn/H20862kT, while the latter is proportional to the surface area of the critical sized
embryo and the probability per unit area per unit time of a vapor atom condensing on
the surface. Accordingly, we have
I/H11005q0OcNe/H11002/H9004Gn/H20862kT15.11
where Iis the number of stable nuclei created per second, Nis the total number of atoms
in the assembly, Ocis the area of the critical embryo, q0is the probability per unit time per
unit area of capturing a vapor atom, and /H9004Gncis the free-energy change associated with
forming an embryo of critical size. It should be noted that q0can be evaluated in terms of
the kinetic theory collision factor p/(2pmkT)1/2, where pis the pressure and mis the
atomic mass.
A basic precept of the Volmer-Weber theory is that after a nucleus has formed it no
longer has to be considered with respect to the formation of the nuclei that follow it. Of
course, the atoms that have joined to make this nucleus are no longer available for the for-
mation of other nuclei. In effect, the theory assumes that additional atoms are continually
added to the system to compensate for those removed from the system. A theory of this
type is therefore designated a quasi-steady-state theory. This kind of theory conforms best
to the experimental conditions when the number of nuclei is small compared to the total
number of atoms.15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 470

functions15.2 THE BECKER-DÖRING THEORY
The Volmer-Weber theory, which served as the basis of the preceding discussion,
assumes that once a nucleus of the critical size obtains an additional atom, it always
grows into a stable nucleus. This assumption is not strictly true. The addition of
an atom, or even several atoms, to critical nucleus will certainly tend to make it
become more stable. However, this increase in stability has to be small. This is
because, at nc, the free energy reaches a maximum and, at the same time, d/H9004Gn/dn
passes through zero. Therefore, an embryo that has grown slightly beyond the crit-
ical size always has a nearly equal chance of shrinking back and becoming smaller.
In formulating their nucleation theory, Becker and Döring recognized this fact. They
also postulated that in the quasi steady state, the number of embryos of a given size
should remain effectively constant, although, individually, embryos might either
grow or shrink in size. The distribution function Zn, giving the number of embryos
corresponding to a given number of atoms, was assumed to be equal to the number
of embryos predicted by the Volmer-Weber theory for very small-sized embryos, and
for very large ones, Znwas assumed to approach zero. Furthermore, unlike
the Volmer-Weber theory, Znwas not assumed to go to zero just above nc. The dif-
ference in the assumptions with regard to Znin the two theories is illustrated in
simple schematic fashion in Fig. 15.8. Finally, with regard to Zn, the Becker-Döring
theory4does not require an exact specification for the distribution function near the
critical nucleus size.
The Becker-Döring theory postulates that the nucleation rate Imust equal the dif-
ference in the two rates at which embryos of a given size containing natoms grow into
embryos containing n/H110011 atoms, and the inverse rate corresponding to the reversion of15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 471
Chapter 15 Nucleation and Growth Kinetics 472
embryos containing n/H110011 atoms into those containing natoms. This follows from the
assumption that Znis independent of time. We may express this relation in the form
I/H11005in:n/H110011/H11002in/H110011 :n15.12
where Iis the number of nuclei formed per sec per m3, in:n/H110011is the rate of conversion
of embryos of size nto size n/H110011, and in/H110011:nis the corresponding opposite rate. For the
case of a liquid nucleating in a vapor, this equation may also be written
I/H11005q0OnZn/H11002qn/H110011On/H110011 Zn/H11001115.13
where Znis the number of embryos containing natoms, q0is the probability per m2per sec
of an atom jumping from the vapor to the liquid, Onis the surface area of a droplet contain-
ing natoms, and the corresponding symbols with a n/H110011 subscript relate to an embryo con-
taining n/H110011 atoms that is assumed to lose an atom. It should be noted that whereas q0can
be assumed to be independent of n, since the chance of a vapor atom striking a droplet
should be nearly independent of the free energy of the droplet, this is not true of an atom
that leaves the droplet to return to the vapor. In this case, the ﬂux of atoms from the embryoshould depend on the free energy of the droplet and thus on its size. As may be seen inFig. 15.2, the free energy of an atom in an embryo becomes more positive with increasingsize of the particle. This means that the rate of evaporation of atoms from a unit area of thesurface of an embryo should increase as it becomes larger. An equation similar to the abovecan be written for all values of the number of atoms in the embryo, as, for example,
I/H11005q0On/H110011 Zn/H110011/H11002qn/H110012On/H110012Zn/H11001215.14
It is thus apparent that there is a large set of these related equations. With the aid of theproper assumptions,
1,5these relationships may be solved to yield the following expression
for the nucleation current:
15.15
where the subscript crefers to quantities measured at the critical embryo size. It should be
noted that the above equation only differs from the Volmer-Weber equation, given in thepreceding section, by the pre-exponential term
It will be shown in the next section that for the case of freezing, /H9004G
ncvaries approximately
as the square of the supercooling /H9004T, or the temperature difference between the temper-
ature of transformation and the equilibrium or freezing temperature. The factor Talso
appears in the denominator of the above expression. In spite of these facts, the variation
of this pre-exponential factor with temperature, in the range of temperatures involved innucleation problems, is much smaller than the variation due to the exponential term. Inaddition, the accuracy of experimental determinations of nucleation rate data is not veryhigh. Therefore, the basic Volmer-Weber relationship may still be considered to adequatelyrepresent the nucleation current. The principal advantage of the Becker-Döring theory isit treats the nucleation problem on a basis that is physically more satisfying.1

15.3 FREEZING
Let us now consider the freezing of a pure metal. While a rigorous treatment would
require that one should consider the problem of the shape of the embryo and nucleus aswell as the problems associated with the attachment of atoms to the surface of a solid,these factors apparently do not strongly inﬂuence the rate of nucleation. One can there-fore assume, to a reasonable approximation, that the solid embryos take a simple spheri-cal shape and that atoms attach themselves to this particle at all points on its surface. Inthis case, the nucleation rate should depend on the number of critical nuclei, N
nc, and the
rate at which an atom can attach itself to the embryo. The ﬁrst quantity, in analogy with thevapor-liquid reaction, should be given by Ne
/H11002/H9004Gnc/kT, where Nis the total number of
atoms in the assembly and /H9004Gncis the free-energy change associated with the formation of
a crit ical embryo. The rate of jumping of atoms across the boundary between the liquid and
the solid may be expressed as the product of an atomic vibration frequency nand the prob-
ability that an atom will make a successful jump. In making this jump there will normallybe an energy barrier that the atom must overcome. Let us designate the magnitude of thefree energy associated with this barrier as /H9004g
a. The nucleation rate or nucleation current
then becomes
I/H11005ne/H11002/H9004ga/H20862kT(Ne/H11002/H9004Gnc/H20862kT) 15.16
In analogy with the equation for the free energy associated with the formation of a
liquid embryo in a vapor, we may set down the following expression for /H9004Gn:
/H9004Gn/H11005n/H9004gls/H11001hglsn2/315.17
where nis the number of atoms in an embryo, /H9004glsis the free-energy difference between
an atom in the liquid and solid phases, his a shape factor, and glsis the surface free energy
of the liquid-solid boundary. It is now possible to evaluate /H9004glsapproximately in terms of
the heat of fusion. Thus at the freezing point
/H9004gls/H11005/H9004hls/H11002T0/H9004sls/H110050 15.18
where /H9004hlsand /H9004slsare the heat of fusion and entropy of fusion per atom, and T0is the
freezing point temperature. Solving this relation for /H9004slsgives /H9004sls/H11005/H9004hls/T0. Now both /H9004sls
and /H9004hlsare not strongly varying functions of the temperature near the freezing point and
may be considered to be constant. Therefore, near the freezing point we have
15.19
In this last expression, /H9004Tis the temperature increment measured with respect to the
freezing point and therefore represents the degree of supercooling.

FIG. 15.9 Variation with temperature of the
various terms involved in the exponent of the
nucleation rate equationThis indicates that the free energy needed to form a critical embryo varies inversely
as the square of the degree of supercooling. Thus not only does the size of the critical
nucleus decrease with the supercooling, but so does the free energy required to form a
critical nucleus. Let us now investigate the effect of some of these factors on the rate of
nucleation. The nucleation rate, when expressed in terms of this simpliﬁed expression for
/H9004Gnc, becomes
I/H11005nNe/H11002(/H9004ga/H11001A//H9004T2)/kT15.21
The most important part of this relation is the exponent, because it controls the nucle-
ation rate. As written above, the exponent has two terms that do not depend upon the
temperature in the same way. The ﬁrst term, /H9004ga/kT, represents the effect of the bound-
ary on the jumping of atoms toward the nucleus. To a reasonable approximation, /H9004ga
may be assumed to be temperature independent and, therefore, this term should vary
inversely with the absolute temperature. The nature of this variation is shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 15.9. In this diagram, the values of the exponential terms have been plotted
using a logarithmic scale. Note that /H9004ga/kTincreases continuously with decreasing tem-
perature. On the other hand, the behavior of the second term, A//H9004T2kT, is quite differ-
ent. At the melting temperature, where /H9004Tis zero, this quantity is inﬁnite. This implies
that at the melting temperature, the nucleation rate must be zero. With decreasing tem-
perature this term falls rapidly and eventually becomes much smaller than the ﬁrst term.
Since the nucleation rate is controlled by the sum of these two terms, it is a maximum
where their sum is a minimum. This point is indicated on the diagram. Above this tem-
perature, the rate of nucleation is effectively controlled by the energy barrier associated15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 474
475 15.4 Solid-State Reactions
with forming the critical embryo; below it the nucleation rate is controlled by the jump
rate of the atoms across the boundary from the liquid to the solid. Figure 15.9 is instruc-tive in another fashion: it shows a very rapid rise of the exponent as one approaches themelting point. This is in excellent agreement with the fact that homogeneous nucleationis very difﬁcult to achieve near the melting point. Conversely, it is also in agreement withthe fact that in a very pure metal it is often possible to achieve a very high degree ofsupercooling.
15.4 SOLID-STATE REACTIONS
Reactions that occur between liquid and solid or solid and solid are said to occur in con-densed systems. In the preceding section we have considered the simplest possible type ofcondensed system transformation: the freezing of a pure metal. In a more general case,such as in the precipitation of a new solid phase from a single-phase solid solution, onemay have to consider that the reaction may be largely controlled by diffusion. This situa-tion would occur when solute, present in a relatively small concentration, has to diffusethrough the matrix in order for the embryo to grow. In 1940 Becker
6proposed that when
this occurs, the nucleation rate might be written
I/H11005Ae/H11002Qd/H20862kTe/H11002/H9004Gnc/H20862kT15.22
where Ais a constant, Qdis the activation energy for the diffusion of the solute, and /H9004Gnc
is the free energy required to form the critical embryo.
In condensed systems involving solid-state reactions, strain energy is usually an
important factor. The formation of a new phase in a solid normally involves some form ofdeformation. An example will be discussed later in the martensite transformation sections.At that point it will be observed that most martensite transformations are believed toinvolve a plane-strain deformation. This corresponds to a shear parallel to the habit planeof the martensite plate and an expansion or contraction normal to this plane. Equivalentdeformations can be expected in most solid-solid transformations. Strains in both thematrix and the newly formed particles will result from these deformations.
Like the surface energy, the strain energy also opposes the formation of a nucleus. It
is normally assumed that the strain energy is proportional to the volume of the embryoand, therefore, to the number of atoms in the embryo. If this is true, the free energy asso-ciated with the embryo becomes
/H9004Gn/H11005n(/H9004gab/H11001/H9004gs)/H11001hgn2/315.23
where /H9004gsis the strain free energy per atom, /H9004gabis the free-energy difference between an
atom in the matrix (alpha phase) and in the embryo (beta phase), his the shape factor, n
is the number of atoms in the embryo, and gis the speciﬁc interface free energy. It should
be noted that /H9004gabis negative, whereas both /H9004gsand gare positive. If /H9004gsis larger in
absolute magnitude than /H9004gab, /H9004Gnmust increase in magnitude with increasing number of
atoms in the embryo. Under these conditions it will be impossible to form a nucleus. In gen-eral, it is to be expected that /H9004g
swill be largest for coherent embryos. When the interface
between the embryo and the matrix is coherent, there exists a perfect match betweenplanes and directions across the interface separating the two structures. These crystallo-graphic features may, of course, suffer a change in direction as they cross the interface. Thegeneral features of a coherent interface may be understood with the aid of Fig. 15.10.

The Aatoms are assumed to be the solvent, and the Bthe solute. It should be noted that
the critical nucleus for coherent precipitates will normally have an approximately spherical

3C, but the bphase: the crystal structure of the Batoms. In the present case, the B
atoms will be attracted to each other, and the ﬁrst stage in the formation of a precipitateparticle will be the formation of a cluster of Batoms. The lattice planes in this cluster will,
in general, be continuous with the planes of the matrix, and the cluster is said to be a coher-
ent particle . If, as shown in Fig. 15.10, the diameter of the solute atom differs from that of
the solvent, then the matrix and the nucleus will both be strained by the presence of thelatter. The strain associated with a nucleus will enlarge as its size increases, but its size can-not increase indeﬁnitely. It is possible that the particle may break away from the lattice ofthe matrix, and when this occurs, a surface, or grain boundary, forms between the twophases. Such a loss of coherency would greatly reduce the state of strain associated withthe precipitate particles. There exists an alternate possibility, however, that now appears tobe more probable. This is that the strains associated with coherency are lost or reducedwhen a new phase that is noncoherent or less coherent forms. This point of view is con-sistent with the fact that multiple precipitate structures are observed in many alloys.
It is most important that it be recognized that the above discussion is far from com-
plete. The subject of nucleation in the solid state is very complex. In this regard it shouldbe mentioned that there also exists a third type of interface between the matrix and thesecond phase. This is a semicoherent boundary that is basically a coherent interface con-taining a grid of dislocations in the boundary. In a coherent boundary, the mismatchbetween the two crystal structures is small enough to be accommodated by elastic strains.In the semicoherent interface the mismatch is accommodated by dislocations. Anextremely simple model for this type of boundary is furnished by the small-angle grainboundary shown in Fig. 6.2. Another model is that of the incoherent twin boundary ofFig. 17.17. Because of space limitations, the complexity of the total problem can only be15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 476

r1/r22FIG. 15.11 The strain energy of an incoherent
nucleus as a function of its shape. (After
Nabarro, F. R. N., Proc. Phys. Soc ., 5290 [1940].)suggested. In a given transformation, a coherent boundary should be preferred if the mis-
match is extremely small, whereas with increasing degree of mismatch the semicoherent
boundary might possess the smaller total energy. This statement has to be tempered by the
fact that the size of the particle also has a bearing on the question. With growing particle
size, the total nonchemical energy of the particle (strain plus surface energies) may be
reduced if a coherent boundary is replaced by a semicoherent boundary.
At this point we shall ignore further considerations of the semicoherent boundary and
consider only coherent and incoherent boundaries, primarily because these two types of
boundaries have been treated in somewhat more detail and are perhaps easier to deﬁne.
In the case of the coherent boundary, it has been shown1that the strain energy of the
embryo is not very dependent on the shape of the particle. In other words, the strain
energy associated with the formation of a spherical embryo is not very different from that
associated with a platelike or even needle-shaped embryo. This is not the case for an inco-
herent embryo. Here the shape may be very important, as has been demonstrated by
Nabarro,7who attacked the problem from the point of view of isotropic elasticity. His com-
putations also involved another basic assumption: that the matrix was much stiffer elasti-
cally than the particles, so that the strain energy of the particles could be neglected in
comparison to that of the matrix. In effect, Nabarro considered the strain energy associ-
ated with expanding a cavity in the matrix. This expansion would be analogous to that
resulting from the pumping of an incompressible ﬂuid into a hole. The shapes of these cav-
ities were assumed to correspond to various ellipsoids of revolution. His results are shown
schematically in Fig. 15.11, plotted as a function of the ratio r1/r2of the semi-axes of the
ellipsoid of revolution, where the three semi-axes were taken to be r1, r2, and r2. If the
ratio r1/r2is very small, the ellipsoid approximates a disc. If r1and r2are equal, the ellip-
soid is a sphere; whereas if r1is much larger than r2, the shape of the ellipsoid approaches
a needle. As may be seen in the diagram, the strain energy is a maximum for a sphere and
is least for a disc. Furthermore, as the thickness of the disc approaches zero, the strain
energy also approaches zero. It should be pointed out that the above description is an over-
simpliﬁcation of the process. Incoherent nucleation may involve vacancies which by
absorption or emission can relieve internal strains.
In evaluating the results of Nabarro for incoherent embryos, one has to recognize that
the total surface energy of the embryo should be least for a sphere. Thus, the effect of shape15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 477

ume of the particle, and the surface energy is dependent on the surface area, one should
expect that the tendency to form discs should become more important as the particle
grows in size. It should be mentioned that many precipitates certainly assume a plate-
like morphology, and this is in good agreement with Nabarro’s predictions. However,
the tendency for a plate-like habit to develop can also be the result of other factors, such
as the nature of the mechanism that controls the growth of the particle. Thus, for exam-
ple, a plate may form if it is easier for atoms to attach themselves to the edge of the par-
ticle than to its ﬂat surfaces. For more detailed analysis on the inﬂuence of
crystallography on the shape and kinetics of homogeneous nucleation in solids, see a
series of papers by LeGoues et al.8–11
15.5 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION
In nature most nucleation occurs heterogeneously, as indicated previously at several
points in this book. In the preceding sections we have shown that homogeneous nucle-
ation is a rather difﬁcult process. At this time a simple problem will be considered that
illustrates one reason why heterogeneous nucleation may be a much easier process to
invoke. In freezing, the container or mold walls often offer preferred sites for nucleation.
This problem can be placed on a quantitative basis if several simplifying assumptions are
made. First, let us assume that solid embryos form on the mold walls as spherical caps, as
suggested in Fig. 15.12. Second, let us assume that at the positions where the surfaces of
the caps make contact with the mold walls, there exists a state of quasi-equilibrium
between the surface forces, as indicated in Fig. 15.13. This balance between the surface
forces is assumed to take place in the direction parallel to the mold surface. In the direc-
tion normal to the mold surface, the surface tensions are not balanced, implying a net trac-
tion acting on the surface. With sufﬁcient time to allow diffusion to occur in the mold wall,
a complete balance between both sets of components might be obtained. The equation
relating the surface forces parallel to the mold walls is
glm/H11005gsm/H11001glscos u 15.24
where glm, gsm, and glsare the surface tensions between liquid and mold wall, solid and
mold wall, and liquid and solid, respectively, and uis the angle of contact of the embryo15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 478

FIG. 15.14 As the embryo grows, its shape is invariantsurface with the mold wall. Note that uis a function of only the three surface tensions.
This signiﬁes that no matter how large the size of the particle, the angle of contact should
be the same. In effect, this says that as the embryo grows, its shape remains invariant as a
spherical cap. This point is illustrated in Fig. 15.14.
We can now write an equation giving the free energy of an embryo. In this case we
shall express the equation in terms of the radius of the surface of the spherical cap rather
than in terms of the number of atoms in the embryo. The equation in question is
/H9004Ghet/H11005Vc/H9004gv/H11001Alsgls/H11001Asm(gsm/H11002glm) 15.25
where /H9004Ghetis the free energy associated with the heterogeneously nucleated embryo, Vc
the volume of the cap-shaped embryo, Alsis the area of the cap that faces the liquid, Asm
is the area of the interface between the embryo and the mold wall, /H9004gvis the free energy
per unit volume associated with the freezing process, and gls, gsm, and glmare the surface
energies as deﬁned above. Note that Asmis multiplied by the difference between gsmand
glm. This is because the surface formed between the embryo and the mold replaces an
equivalent area of liquid and mold interface.
Now consider Fig. 15.12, which corresponds to a cross-section taken through the cen-
ter of the embryo. Note that the height of the cap is equal to r(1/H11002cos u) and that the
radius of the circular area, corresponding to the interface between the cap and the mold
wall, is r(sin u). We may therefore set down the following relationships:
Als/H110052pr2(1/H11002cos u)
Asm/H11005pr2sin2u 15.26
Vc/H110051/3 pr3(2/H110023 cos u/H11001cos3u)
If all of the above relationships and Eq. 15.24 are substituted into the equation for the free
energy of the embryo and the resulting expression is simpliﬁed, one obtains

nucleation to that for homogeneous nucleation as a function of u, the

heterogeneously nucleated embryo to the free energy of an equivalent homoge-
neously nucleated one. This relation is as follows:
15.28
where /H9004Ghomis the free energy of a spherical embryo of radius equal to the radius of the
cap of the heterogeneously nucleated particle. This expression states that the free energy
to form a nucleus heterogeneously at the mold wall varies directly as the homogeneous
free energy modiﬁed by a factor that is a function only of the angle of contact ubetween
the mold wall and the embryo. Since this angle is determined by the relative surface
energies of the three surfaces in question, it is obvious that the free energy of heteroge-
neous nucleation is directly dependent on these surface energies. Also, since Eq. 15.28
holds for all values of r, it must hold when ris equal to rc, the critical radius. This, in
turn, signiﬁes that

The factor (2 /H110023 cos u/H11001cos3u)/4 that converts the homogeneous nucleation free energy
to the free energy of heterogeneous nucleation is plotted as a function of uin Fig. 15.15. It
is signiﬁcant that this factor is very small for even rather large values of the contact angle.
Thus, when uis 10 degrees, the multiplying factor is of the order of about 10/H110024. When uis
30 degrees, it is only about 0.02, and at 90 degrees, or at one-half the limit of applicability
of Eq. 15.29, it is still only equal to one-half. The signiﬁcance of this large decrease in the
free energy to form a critical nucleus cannot be overestimated. The effect has to be very/H9004G het

large. In this regard, let us consider the nucleation rate equation for the case of heteroge-
neous nucleation. The number of critical embryos should be given by the equation
Nme/H11002/H9004Ghet/kT15.30
where Nmis the number of atoms in the liquid phase facing the mold wall. This is a rea-
sonable assumption, because only the atoms in contact with the mold can form an embryoat the surface. Note that N
mis a much smaller number than N, the number of atoms in the
assembly, that appears in the corresponding equation for the embryos undergoing homo-geneous nucleation. On the other hand, the exponent in Eq. 15.30 can easily be enoughsmaller to more than compensate for this difference in the pre-exponential term. By anal-ogy to our previous expressions for the nucleation rate, we may now write for the case ofheterogeneous nucleation:
I/H11005nNm(e/H11002/H9004ga/kT)(e/H11002/H9004Ghcet/kT) 15.31
where nis a frequency and /H9004gais the free energy associated with the jump of an atom
across the interface between the liquid and solid embryo.
15.6 GROWTH KINETICS
Growth kinetics become important once an embryo has exceeded the critical size andbecome a stable nucleus. In some cases this may occur at an extremely early stage in thedevelopment of the particle. As was the case with nucleation kinetics, there are alsomany facets to the study of growth kinetics, and only a couple of very simple exampleswill be considered. The primary purpose of these is to show the nature of the approachused in studying growth. First, it should be noted that reactions involving a large heat oftransformation, such as occurs in freezing, present a special problem. Here the growthrate may be largely determined by the rate at which it is possible to remove the heat offusion. The simplest growth theories, accordingly, ignore this type of problem and corre-spond to transformations in which the heat of transformation is very small, so that theymay be assumed to be isothermal. Certain solid state reactions probably come closest tosatisfying this condition. Thus, for example, consider the phase changes in iron.
12The
heat of fusion of iron is 15,360 J per mole, while the heat of transformation from thedelta to the gamma phase is 690 J per mole, and that for the transformation from gammato alpha is 900 J per mole.
Let us assume that we are concerned with a transformation in a pure substance that
occurs within the solid state and that a particle has grown sufﬁciently so that it has becomea stable nucleus. It is further assumed that the particle is spherical in shape, that no vol-ume change is involved as atoms leave the alpha phase and join the beta phase in the par-ticle, and that surface energy or capillarity effects can be neglected. This means that weshall ignore strain energy. Finally, it is assumed that growth occurs continuously or with-out the need for steps on the surface where the atoms can successfully attach themselves.The role of growth involving the movement of steps has received considerable attentionin recent years. The subject is too lengthy to consider here, so the reader is referred toother sources.
1,13In general, it is felt that step-wise growth is probably most important
when the driving force for growth is very small.
Under the conditions stated above, it is reasonable to assume that the curve relating
the free energy of an atom as it moves across the boundary from the alpha phase matrix15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 481

Δgαββ phase 
Distance Free energy FIG. 15.16 The energy barrier associated with
the growth of a precipitate during a solid-state
phase change in a polymorphic pure metal
onto the beta phase precipitate has the form given in Fig. 15.16. Note that in crossing the
boundary, the atom has to pass over an energy barrier equal to /H9004ga, and when it joins the
beta phase it has a lower energy than it had in the alpha phase. The corresponding differ-
ence in free energy is indicated on the diagram by /H9004gab. This difference in energy per atom
is assumed to be equal to the chemical free-energy difference between an atom in the a
and bphases.
We may now write an expression for the net rate of atom transfer from the matrix to
the particle as equal to the difference in the rate of atom movement toward and away from
the particle. This is
I/H11005Sne/H11002/H9004ga/kT/H11002Sne/H11002(/H9004ga/H11001/H9004gba)/kT15.32
where Sis the number of atoms facing the surface, nis an atomic vibration frequency, and
Iis the net number of atoms per second leaving the matrix to join the beta phase. This
expression reduces to
I/H11005Sne/H11002/H9004ga/kT(1/H11002e/H11002/H9004gba/kT) 15.33
Let us now assume that when the atoms jump they move through an average distance l.
The velocity of the boundary will therefore be given by
15.34
where I/Srepresents the average number of jumps per second per atom facing the bound-
ary, and lis the distance corresponding to each of these jumps. The velocity may now be
expressed in terms of the equation for Ias

S15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 482
483 15.6 Growth Kinetics
Now consider /H9004gba. This quantity represents the decrease in free energy when an
atom joins the nucleus, ignoring surface and strain energy effects. In analogy with /H9004gts, this
free energy may be expected to vary directly as the degree of supercooling. For a very small
supercooling, /H9004gbawill be small, and for a sufﬁciently small supercooling, we may assume
. If this is true, then the exponential term e/H11002/H9004gbamay be assumed to be
approximately equal to the ﬁrst two terms in its series expansion, or
e/H11002/H9004gba/kT/H110151/H11002/H9004gba/kT 15.36
Under these conditions, the growth velocity becomes
15.37
Since /H9004gba, as indicated above, should vary approximately as /H9004T(the supercooling), for
small supercooling the growth velocity should be roughly proportional to the degree of
supercooling. On the other hand, if the degree of supercooling is large, /H9004gbamay become
greater than kT. This is also encouraged by the fact that large supercooling normally
requires that the temperature be lowered to very small values. When this happens, the
exponential term becomes very small and the quantity (1 /H11002e/H11002/H9004gba/kT) may be equated to
unity. The velocity equation may then be written
v/H11015lne/H11002/H9004ga/kT15.38
This last expression shows that as Tbecomes very small, the growth velocity again
approaches zero. Since it is also zero at the transformation temperature, the velocity
must be a maximum at some intermediate temperature. This has actually been exper-
imentally veriﬁed for the transformation of beta tin to alpha tin on cooling, as shown
in Fig. 15.17. Note that just below the transformation temperature at 13°C, the growth
rate is very small but increases with increasing supercooling; then it eventually
decreases again as the temperature becomes very low. This general trend of the
dependence of the growth rate on temperature is similar to that which was shown to
be characteristic of nucleation.v/H11015l/H9263/H20898/H9004gba

In the preceding section growth was considered under conditions where a new phase
grows out of another phase by a simple transfer of atoms of a single component. We shall
now treat the case where the transformation not only involves the formation of a new
phase, but where this phase also possesses a composition different from that of the old
phase. A relatively simple example of this type of reaction is the precipitation of iron-
carbide particles from a supersaturated solid solution of carbon in alpha iron. This reaction
has been studied in detail by Wert14using torsion pendulum measurements. Since the car-
bide particles contain 6.7 percent carbon, whereas the matrix from which they form
always has a small fraction of a percent of carbon, it is obvious that carbon atoms have to
diffuse over relatively long distances in order for the carbide particles to grow.
As a result of Wert’s observations on the precipitation of carbides in dilute solutions of
alpha iron, Zener15proposed a simple theory for this type of growth. For our present pur-
poses, however, let us ﬁrst consider Zener’s theory in terms of a precipitate that is not
spherical, but which grows as a plate in the direction normal to its surface. This assumption
of one-dimensional growth greatly simpliﬁes the problem. Now consider Fig. 15.18A. In
this diagram the shaded region represents the precipitate after it has grown to a thickness
equal to x. Figure 15.18B shows a schematic plot of the concentration of the solute Bas a
function of distance in which the concentration is expressed in atoms per m3. Note that as
in the case of iron-carbide precipitating in iron, the concentration of the solute in the
precipitate is higher than that in the matrix. This concentration is shown as nb
B. The
assumption is also made that the time for the atoms to cross the boundary between
the matrix and the precipitate is small compared to the time for the solute to diffuse up to
the precipitate. Under this condition, the concentration of Bin that part of the matrix
immediately facing the precipitate may be assumed to equal the equilibrium concentra-
tion. This is the concentration of Bin the alpha phase that would be in equilibrium with
the beta phase and is designated na
Bin the diagram. Note that, in effect, one considers that
“local” equilibrium exists at the boundary. The ﬁgure also shows that as one moves away15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 484
485 15.7 Diffusion Controlled Growth
from the interface, the concentration of Brises in the matrix to the value marked n/H11009
B.
This latter concentration is assumed to be that which the matrix possessed before the
precipitation started. The drop in concentration near the interface is the result of the
short-range jumping of atoms from the matrix into the precipitate.
Now let us assume that in a small time increment dt, the boundary of the precipitate
moves forward into the matrix through a distance dx. This has the effect of converting a
volume of material, equal to A dx, from a concentration na
Bto a concentration nb
B. In order
for this to occur, ( nb

Zener has given an approximate solution to this equation based on the drawing of

is determined by the fact that the two shaded regions shown in the diagram should

The subscript 1 of the parameter a*
1indicates that the approximate solution is for one-dimen-
sional growth. Differentiation of Eq. 15.46 gives the growth velocity in the simpliﬁed form
15.48
This equation indicates that for one-dimensional growth, the interface position varies as
and its velocity as .
These results have a very general application and, as Zener has shown by dimen-
sional analysis, whenever the growth is controlled by a simple diffusion process of thetype indicated above, the interface position varies with the square root of the time, andgrowth velocity varies inversely as the square root of the time. Thus, in the case of three-dimensional or spherical growth, we may therefore write
15.49
However, in this case Zener indicates that the parameter a*
3depends to some degree upon
the original concentration of the solute in the alpha phase.

FIG. 15.20 The iron-carbon diagram at the iron-rich endZener relative to the iron-carbon diagram. This diagram is redrawn in Fig. 15.20 with
concentrations expressed in atomic percent. For the purposes of this discussion, we will
assume that we can use concentrations in atomic percent to express the various values
of nBin the Zener equation where they will actually correspond to numbers of atoms
per cm3. This will not affect our general conclusions. Suppose an alloy of iron con-
taining 0.08 atomic percent of iron is heated to 727°C (1000 K), shown by point Ain
Fig. 15.20, where it is kept for a long enough period to give a homogeneous Fe-C solid
solution. The alloy is then quenched to 400°C (673 K), shown by point Bin the ﬁgure.
The metal will be supersaturated and will contain 0.08 atomic percent carbon, or n/H11009

0.0008. At the same time, by the phase diagram, the equilibrium concentration na

Bis 0.25. Substituting these values in the expression for a*1,
Eq. 15.47, gives us
Any further lowering of the temperature to which the metal is quenched
will not markedly change the value of a*1. This is because the equilibrium concen-
tration is already small at 400°C, and any further decrease in na

a small effect on the numerator in the above equation. On the other hand, v/H110050.0008 /H110020.000011

bon in iron may be represented by

Thus we may write
15.51
Below 400°C the term e/H1100241,430/ RTbecomes increasingly more important and, as Tbecomes
smaller, the growth velocity can be considered to decrease primarily because of thedecreasing diffusion rate of the carbon atoms.
At elevated temperatures, the roles of diffusion and concentration gradient are effec-
tively reversed. Near 700°C (973 K), for example, a given change in temperature has astronger effect on the concentration gradient than it does on D
1/2.
The result of these effects is a growth rate that maximizes at an intermediate temper-
ature. It is small at high temperatures because the concentration gradient tends to dimin-ish, and it is small at low temperatures because of the lowering of the rate of diffusion.
15.8 INTERFERENCE OF GROWING PRECIPITATE PARTICLES
According to the Zener theory discussed in the preceding section, the growth velocity forsimple geometries should vary inversely as . This means that with increasing time, the rateof boundary migration must decrease and become very small. This decrease in growthvelocity is due to the fact that as the particle grows, it continues to absorb solute atoms fromthe matrix surrounding it, and the concentration gradient next to the particle decreases. Inthis theory, each particle is assumed to lie in a matrix of inﬁnite extent. In an actual speci-men there will be many particles drawing solute atoms from the matrix, and the distancesbetween them will be ﬁnite. In the beginning, as the particles start to grow, there will be noeffective competition between particles for the solute atoms, and the Zener assumption isin agreement with the facts. This is indicated schematically for the case of two parallel plate-shaped precipitates in Fig. 15.21A. However, with continued growth, the regions fromwhich the particles are drawing solute atoms will tend to overlap. When this occurs, themaximum value of the solute concentration in the matrix has to fall below n
/H11009
B. This, in turn,
must inﬂuence the effective value of the concentration gradient at the surface of the parti-cles and, in general, should act to further decrease the rate of growth. The resultant changein the concentration proﬁle is shown schematically in Fig. 15.21B.
15.9 INTERFACE CONTROLLED GROWTH
There is still another basic possibility under which growth can occur. In this case the pre-cipitate, as in the preceding sections, is assumed to differ in composition from the matrix.However, here the growth rate is controlled by the mechanism that allows the soluteatoms to cross over from the matrix to the precipitate. Thus, suppose that the timerequired for an atom to jump across the interface is very long compared to that requiredfor it to diffuse to the interface. In this case, as shown schematically in Fig. 15.22, thesolute concentration in the matrix will remain effectively constant throughout thematrix. However, with continued growth of the precipitate, the level of the concentrationin the matrix has to fall. This means that the driving force for growth also has to fall,vtv /H11005a*1/H20898D0

FIG. 15.21 Depletion of the matrix can occur as the precipitate
particles grow, as illustrated by this schematic diagram showing
planar precipitate particles
since it is directly related to the degree of supersaturation. Attention is called to the dif-
ference between this case and that discussed earlier involving the growth of a precipi-
tate where there was no change in composition between the precipitate and the matrix.
Returning to Fig. 15.22, attention is called to the fact that one-dimensional growth
is again assumed, and two plate-like precipitates are indicated. Part A of this diagram is
assumed to correspond to an early period in the growth of the precipitates, while part B cor-
responds to a later time. Note that as a result of the growth of the precipitates, the concentra-
tion level in the matrix drops from n/H11009

in the matrix is taken as na

B.
We have already considered an example of growth controlled by an interface reaction:
that involved in a phase transformation of a pure metal in Sec. 15.6. In some respects the
present growth phenomenon is analogous to that already discussed. Thus, with reference
to Fig. 15.16, a Batom, on leaving the matrix, has to pass over an energy barrier ( /H9004ga) in
order to join the precipitate. After this has occurred, its energy level will have been low-
ered by the amount /H9004gab
B. However, there is one important difference: a composition dif-
ference exists across the boundary. Thus the number of atoms capable of jumping, that
face the surface, is different on the two sides of the boundary. In other words, there now
exist two factors, S1and S2, instead of a single factor S. However, at equilibrium the jump
rate across the boundary has to be equal in the two directions. At the same time, the free
energy of a jumping atom is also the same on both sides of the boundary so that /H9004gab/H110050.15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 489
Chapter 15 Nucleation and Growth Kinetics 490
Therefore, a reasonable assumption for a reaction occurring near equilibrium is that, effec-
tively, S1/H11005S2. With this and the previous assumptions that the strain and surface energies
may be neglected, we may write a velocity equation of the form
15.52
where gis a factor proportional to the jump distance of an atom, and nhas the same
signiﬁcance as in Eq. 15.33; /H9004gab
Bis the free-energy difference between a Batom in the
alpha and beta phases; and /H9004gais the energy barrier at the interface that a Batom has
to pass over in order to join the precipitate. The energy difference, /H9004gab
B, which is
assumed to be much smaller than kT, can now be evaluated in terms of the difference
in the partial-molal free energy of a Batom in the alpha and beta phases. This follows
from the deﬁnition of the partial-molal free energy (see Sec. 10.7). Thus we have

tial-molal free energies are expressed per mole, their difference is divided by Nto
yield a free-energy difference per atom. The subscript ton the term (a

that this quantity changes with time. Substitution of the above relation into the

where (a

at equilibrium with the beta phase. The above substitution is possible since, at equilibrium,(

where ( Na

v/H11005gne/H11002/H9004ga/kT{(Na

It is interesting to compare this relation for the interface-controlled growth of a pre-
cipitate with that derived earlier for the growth rate when it is controlled by diffusion.Thus, in the case of one-dimensional, diffusion-controlled growth, it was found that
15.59
where a*
1is a function of the compositions of the phases but, within limits, may be
assumed to be effectively constant. In comparing these two rate equations, the basicdifference between the composition-dependent terms {( N
a
B)t/H11002(Na
B)e} and a*1should be
emphasized. Until the solute becomes depleted, a*1can be considered a constant,
whereas the expression {( Na
B)t/H11002(Na
B)e} is not a constant, since ( Na
B)tdecreases with
increasing growth of the precipitate. This difference is due to the fact that in diffusion-controlled growth, local equilibrium is attained at the interface. This is not true ininterface-controlled growth. In other words, local equilibrium at the interface isassumed during diffusion-controlled growth, but not during interface-controlledgrowth. More detailed discussion of the effect of interfacial kinetics on the interfacemotion can be found in an article by W. C. Johnson.

FIG. 15.23 The growth rate in the transformation from alpha tin to
beta tin (on heating). (After Burgers, W. G., and Groen, L. J., Disc.
Faraday Soc ., 23183 [1957].)Next, it should be noted that in a precipitation reaction, interface growth rates must
generally be much slower than diffusion-controlled growth rates. In a broad sense, the
precipitation process involves two mechanisms working in series. An atom has to diffuse
up to the interface in order to jump across it. Only when the mean time for an atom to
jump across the interface is very long will the interface reaction be the controlling one.
Finally, it is evident that both types of reactions have rates that decrease with time. In the
diffusion-controlled velocity equation, this is revealed by the fact that v/H11008 t/H110021/2. In the
interface-controlled velocity equation, the time dependence appears in the term ( Na
B)t,
which decreases as the solute leaves the matrix.
15.10 TRANSFORMATIONS THAT OCCUR ON HEATING
Only phase transformations that occur as a result of cooling have been considered to this
point. The corresponding reactions that take place on heating are also signiﬁcant. There are
important differences between the kinetics of the reactions that occur on cooling and those
that occur on heating. Thus, consider the melting of a pure metal. Superheating is almost
impossible to achieve whereas, under the proper conditions, supercooling can be readily
observed. The causes for this difference in behavior are probably related to the fact that it is
very easy to heterogeneously nucleate a liquid droplet at an exterior surface or along a grain
boundary. In Fig. 15.17 it was shown that the growth rate in the cooling phase transforma-
tion from white ( b) to grey ( a) tin followed a typical nucleation and growth temperature
dependence. That is, the growth rate is small just below the transformation temperature, but
with decreasing temperature it rises and passes through a maximum and then decreases
again. The growth rate of the reversed phase transformation does not show this trend but
rises steeply and continuously with increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 15.23. At very15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 492

because diffusion rates always decrease rapidly with decreasing temperatures. On heating,
the diffusion rate is always a steadily increasing function of the temperature. Therefore, it is
generally true that both the rate of nucleation and the rate of growth will rise continuously
with temperatures above a transformation temperature. In other words, the effect of tem-
perature on the diffusion rate always tends to accelerate the reaction as the temperature is
raised above the transformation temperature.
15.11 DISSOLUTION OF A PRECIPITATE
Another form of reaction associated with heating is the dissolution of a precipitate. In prin-
ciple this is the reverse of the precipitation process. The kinetics are usually somewhat dif-
ferent, and this will be discussed brieﬂy later. For the present, let us consider the nature of
the process. Figure 15.24 shows the aluminum-rich end of the aluminum-copper phase
diagram. Suppose that one has an alloy containing about 4 percent copper, that is nearly
in equilibrium at 200°C (473 K). The structure should consist of small uparticles in a
matrix of almost pure aluminum. Such a structure is shown in Fig. 15.25. Since these par-
ticles are readily visible under an optical microscope, the metal is actually in the overaged
condition. To develop this structure it was necessary to age the alloy for 200 hours at 200°C
(473 K). Aging at room temperature will not produce a structure of this type within any rea-
sonable time interval, since the reaction rates at room temperature are too slow to pro-
duce the equilibrium structure. As can be deduced from Fig. 15.24, heating this specimen
to 540°C (813 K) will increase the solubility of copper in the aluminum to where it can15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 493

be completely dissolved. Figure 15.26 shows some measurements made by Batz, Tanzilli,
and Heckel17that reveal some very interesting data about the solution process of this alloy
at 540°C (813 K). While the original average particle size was larger than that shown inFig. 15.25, this has no real bearing on the results. The abscissa of Fig. 15.26 gives the size ofthe particles in microns, while the ordinate gives the number per unit volume in a givensize class. Each solid line represents the size distribution of the particles. Note that withincreasing time these curves are displaced to the left with little change in shape. This impliesthat the size distribution curve is essentially unaltered in shape as the particles dissolve.
Aaron and Kotler
18have pointed out a number of practical reasons why the kinetics
of dissolution should be better understood. In those cases where the presence of thesecond-phase particles results in an alloy of superior properties, it is desirable to know howit might be possible to develop a precipitate that will dissolve very slowly if the metal isheated. On the other hand, when the presence of a precipitate is harmful to the proper-ties of an alloy, it is advantageous to know how to decrease the life of the precipitate sothat the metal may be more easily homogenized.
The dissolution of a precipitate differs in one fundamental respect from the growth of
a precipitate. The process does not require nucleation since the particles that are to be dis-solved are already present. The problem, therefore, is essentially one of reversed growth,although the kinetics are usually different. In a one-dimensional analysis, it is possible toshow that the kinetics of growth and dissolution are both governed by a t
1/2law. Thus,15Ch15.qxd  11/6/08  3:52 PM  Page 494
495 Problems
Aaron,19using an analysis similar to that of Zener in Sec. 15.6, has shown that the thick-
ness of a precipitate should vary as

where x(t) is the thickness of the planar precipitate at any time t, xois its original thickness,
kis a constant, and Dis the diffusion coefﬁcient of the solute.
In the case of a spherical precipitate, the growth and dissolution kinetics are not gen-
erally so simply related. This subject is beyond the scope of this book, and for further infor-
mation, one is referred to the review paper by Aaron and Kotler.20x(t)/H11005xo/H11002kvDt

The equation for the equilibrium concentration of carbon in body-centered cubic iron as
a function of temperature, C/H11005Be/H11002Q/RT, is not typical only of the iron-carbon system.
Similar relationships are observed for nitrogen, or hydrogen in interstitial solution in iron,
or for all three elements (carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen) in interstitial solution in other
metals, providing that the maximum solubility is under approximately 1 atomic percent.
This 1-percent limitation is usually unimportant in interstitial solid solutions as they are
almost always very dilute.
The above law may also be used to predict the maximum solubility in substitutional solid
solutions. Here again it is quite accurate as long as the maximum solubility at high temper-
ature does not exceed 1 percent. In those cases where the solubility exceeds 1 percent, the
equation still gives a curve that is a useful approximation of experimentally observed solu-
bility relations. Since there are many binary alloys (two-component) with limited solubilities
of the component metals in each other, curves like that in Fig. 16.1 are quite common. This
ﬁgure, incidentally, is the same as Fig. 9.3 in Chapter 9 and shows the solubility of carbon in
alpha-iron.
Solubility relationships of the type shown in Fig. 16.1 have great practical signiﬁ-
cance, for they make possible the precipitation, or age hardening, of metals—an
extremely important method of hardening of metals. This type of hardening is used most

often in commercial strengthening of nonferrous alloys, especially aluminum and mag-
nesium alloys. For the sake of convenience, the age hardening process in iron alloyed
with small quantities of carbon will be taken up here. The basic principles developed,
however, are applicable to other more general alloy systems.
16.1 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOLVUS CURVE
Curves of the type shown in Fig. 16.1 are called solvus lines . The signiﬁcance of this line
will now be investigated. For this purpose, consider a speciﬁc temperature: 923 K (650°C).
Assume that at this temperature a grain of ferrite is in contact with a grain of cementite,
as shown in Fig. 16.2. In a system of this type, it is possible for carbon atoms to leave the
solid solutions (ferrite) and enter the cementite. When this happens, however, three iron
atoms of the solution must also join the cementite lattice in order to maintain the strict
stoichiometric ratio characteristic of iron-carbide: three atoms of iron to one of carbon.
Similarly, when a carbon atom leaves Fe3C to enter the solution, three iron atoms must
leave the compound. In the very dilute solutions presently considered (approximately 0.01
percent carbon), the effect on the concentration of the solid solution of the addition or
removal of solvent atoms (iron) simultaneously with the carbon is negligible. It can, there-
fore, be assumed that concentration changes are due only to transfers of carbon atoms
between the two phases. It must be kept in mind, however, that as carbon enters iron car-
bide, the latter phase grows in volume, and that the composition of this phase does not
change. On the other hand, when carbon enters the solid solution (ferrite), the composi-
tion of the latter changes.
Figure 16.3 shows a hypothetical plot of the free energy of the ferrite plus cementite
system as a function of the carbon concentration in the ferrite. Point aon this curve repre-
sents the composition at which the free energy of the ferrite-cementite system is a mini-
mum. It is also the same composition (0.010 percent) that one obtains from the solvus
curve at 923 K (650°C). The ferrite in a ferrite-cementite aggregate will thus seek the com-
position of the solvus curve at any given temperature. If for any reason the solid solution
should have the composition bin Figs. 16.1 and 16.3, carbon will leave the cementite to
increase the concentration of the solid solution. The free energy of the system is, of course,
lowered by this spontaneous reaction. On the other hand, if the ferrite is supersaturated

spontaneous reaction also lowers the carbon concentration of the ferrite (and the free
energy of the system).
16.2 THE SOLUTION TREATMENT
Consider a speciﬁc dilute iron-carbon alloy, one with a total carbon content of 0.008 per-cent. If this alloy is in equilibrium at room temperature, nearly all of the carbon will be inthe form of cementite because the solubility of carbon in ferrite at 300 K is only 8.2 /H11003
10
/H1100212percent (see Fig. 16.1). Suppose that this same alloy is heated to 923 K, indicated by
point din Fig. 16.1. At this temperature the equilibrium concentration of carbon in the
solid solution is 0.010 percent, which is more than the total amount of carbon in themetal. The cementite stable at room temperature is no longer stable at 923 K and dissolvesby yielding its carbon atoms to the solid solution. Because the equilibrium concentrationis greater than the total carbon content of the alloy, the cementite must disappear com-pletely if the alloy is maintained for a sufﬁciently long time at the elevated temperature.The alloy that originally contained two phases (cementite and ferrite) is thus converted toa single phase (ferrite). However, the solid solution attained by maintaining the specimenat 923 K is not a saturated solution because it contains less than the equilibrium concen-tration. On the other hand, it cannot lower its free energy and assume the equilibriumconcentration for a mixture of ferrite and cementite because there is no extra carbon avail-able for this purpose.
Let us study the effect of rapid cooling on the above alloy after it has been transformed
into a homogeneous solid solution at 923 K. Very rapid cooling of heated metal specimenscan be accomplished by immersing them in a liquid cooling medium, for example, water.This operation is generally known as a quench . In the present case, a very rapid quench
will prevent an appreciable diffusion of the carbon atoms, so it can be assumed that thesolid solution that existed at 923 K is brought down to room temperature essentiallyunchanged. The alloy, which was slightly unsaturated at the higher temperature, will nowbe extremely supersaturated. Its 0.008 percent carbon in solution is roughly 10
9times
greater than the equilibrium value (8.2 /H1100310/H1100212percent). The alloy is, accordingly, in a
very unstable condition. Precipitation of this excess carbon through the formation ofcementite will markedly lower the free energy and can be expected to occur sponta-neously. The conditions under which this may occur will be discussed in the next section,but at this point it should be mentioned that the ﬁrst stage in a precipitation-hardeningheat treatment has just been outlined. A suitable alloy is heated to a temperature at whicha second phase (usually present in small quantities) dissolves in the more abundant phase.The metal is left at this temperature until a homogeneous solid solution is attained, andthen it is quenched to a lower temperature to create a supersaturated condition. This heat-treating cycle is known as the solution treatment , while the second stage, which is to be dis-
cussed, is called the aging treatment .
16.3 THE AGING TREATMENT
The precipitation of cementite from supersaturated ferrite occurs by a nucleation andgrowth process. First, it is necessary to nucleate the cementite crystals. Following nucle-ation, cementite particles grow in size as a result of the diffusion of carbon from the sur-rounding ferrite toward the particles. This is called growth . No precipitation can occur until16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 500

alloynucleation begins, but once it has started, the solid solution can lose its carbon in two ways,
either to the growing particles already formed or in the formation of additional nuclei. In
other words, nucleation may continue simultaneously with the growth of particles previ-
ously formed. The progress of precipitation at a given temperature is shown in Fig. 16.4,
where the amount of precipitate, in percentage of the maximum, is plotted as a function of
time. Logarithmic units are used for the time scale because spontaneous reactions of this
nature usually start rapidly and ﬁnish slowly. In general, precipitation does not begin imme-
diately, but requires a ﬁnite time t0before it is detectable. This time interval is called the
incubation period and represents the time necessary to form stable visible nuclei. The curve
also shows that the precipitation process ﬁnishes very slowly, an effect that is to be expected
in light of the continued loss of solute from the solution.
The speed at which precipitation occurs varies with temperature. This is shown qual-
itatively in Fig. 16.5. At very low temperatures, long times are required to complete the
precipitation because the diffusion rate is very slow. Here the rate of the reaction is con-
trolled by the rate at which atoms can migrate. The rate of precipitation is also very slow
at temperatures just below the solvus line (point e, Fig. 16.1). In this case, the solution is
only slightly oversaturated and the free-energy decrease resulting from precipitation is
very small. Nucleation is, accordingly, slow, and precipitation is controlled by the rate at
which nuclei can form. The high diffusion rates that exist at these temperatures can do lit-
tle if nuclei do not form. At intermediate temperatures, between the two above-
mentioned extremes, the precipitation rate increases to a maximum, so that the time to
complete the precipitation is very short. In this range, the combination of moderate diffu-
sion and nucleation rates makes precipitation rapid.
The most important effect of the precipitation of the second phase (cementite) is that
the matrix (ferrite) is hardened. Figure 16.6 shows a typical hardening curve for a dilute
iron-carbon alloy. To obtain curves of this nature, a number of specimens are ﬁrst given a
solution heat treatment in order to convert their structures into supersaturated solid solu-
tions. Immediately following the quench of the solution heat treatment, the specimens
are placed in a suitable furnace maintained at an intermediate constant temperature16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 501

then removed from the furnace at regular intervals, cooled to room temperature, and
tested for hardness. The data obtained in this manner are then plotted to show the effect
of time on hardness. The signiﬁcant feature of this curve is the maximum it possesses.
Holding, or aging, the specimens for too long a period at a given temperature causes them
to lose their hardness. This effect is known as overaging .
The shape of the aging curve is primarily a function of two variables: the temperature
at which aging occurs and the composition of the metal. Let us consider the ﬁrst of these
variables. Figure 16.7 shows three curves, each corresponding to aging at different tem-
peratures. The curve marked T1represents aging at too low a temperature. In this case,
atomic motion is so slow that no appreciable precipitation occurs and hardening occurs
slowly. A further lowering of the aging temperature below T1will effectively stop all pre-
cipitation and prevent hardening. Use is made of this fact in the aircraft industry when alu-
minum-alloy rivets, which normally harden at room temperature, are kept in deep-freeze
refrigerators until they are driven. In this way the rivets, which have been previously
solution-treated in the supersaturated condition, are prevented from aging until they are
incorporated in the article being fabricated.
Temperature T2corresponds to an optimum temperature, a temperature at which
maximum hardening occurs within a reasonable length of time. This temperature lies
above T1, but below T3. At T3, hardening occurs quickly due to rapid diffusion. However,
softening effects also are accelerated, resulting in a lower maximum hardness. The mech-
anism explaining these effects will be discussed in Sec. 16.9.
The effect of changing the composition, the other variable that inﬂuences the aging
curve, will now be considered. For low-solute concentrations, the degree of supersaturation
is small at the end of the solution treatment, and the free energy of the system is, at best,
only slightly higher than that of the equilibrium concentration. Under these conditions it is16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 502
503 16.4 Development of Precipitates
difﬁcult to nucleate the second phase, and hardening occurs slowly at constant tempera-
tures. Furthermore, the maximum hardness that can be obtained will be small because thetotal amount of precipitate is not large and, in general, the smaller the amount of precipi-tate, the smaller the maximum hardness. On the other hand, increasing the total soluteconcentration makes possible a greater maximum hardness at a given aging temperature.The more solute that is available, the more the precipitate and the greater the hardness. Inaddition, at higher solute concentrations the maximum hardness will be attained in ashorter time, for both the rate of nucleation and the rate of growth are increased.Nucleation rates rise because of a greater difference in free energy between the supersatu-rated and equilibrium states, while growth rates are increased because of the greateramount of solute available for the formation of the precipitate. These effects are, however,limited to the extent that it is possible to dissolve the solute in the solvent during the solu-tion treatment. Thus, in Fig. 16.1, the maximum solubility of carbon in iron (0.022 percent)occurs at 1000 K (727°C). Compositions containing carbon in excess of 0.022 percent canstill only dissolve this amount in the ferrite; the remainder remains in the form of cemen-tite. Low-carbon-steel compositions containing more than the maximum amount of carbonsoluble in iron (0.022 percent) are still able to undergo precipitation hardening as long asthe solution-treating temperature is not raised above 1,000 K. Figure 16.7 shows a numberof aging curves for a steel of 0.06 percent carbon.
Finally, it should be pointed out that for certain alloys, the quenching rate, pre-aging ,
can also markedly inﬂuence the precipitation kinetics and morphology.
1–3Such inﬂuence
has been attributed to the interaction and association of vacancies with solute atoms. Forexample, Vyhnal and Radcliffe
1have shown that the carbide precipitate morphology and
intensity of precipitation in Fe–0.019 wt. % carbon aged at 25 and 100°C depend on thequenching rate above a critical range. The authors attribute this pre-aging inﬂuence to theretardation of the normal loss of vacancies during quenching because of the strong attrac-tion between vacancies and interstitial carbon atoms. With increased quenching rate, agreater fraction of the supersaturated vacancies are retained as stable carbon-vacancypairs. The inﬂuence of the pairs on the precipitation rate and morphology depends on theaging temperature. At low aging temperatures, the pairs serve as preferred nucleationsites, resulting in a high density of ﬁne carbide precipitate and hardness. At high agingtemperature, on the other hand, the vacancy-carbon pairs enhance growth by relievingcoherency strain.
16.4 DEVELOPMENT OF PRECIPITATES
How the precipitates form and grow during precipitation is a subject of considerable tech-nical importance. The precipitation hardening process becomes very complex, particularlyin commercial alloys, which may contain more than one solute that contributes to the agehardening. Fortunately, however, a great deal of research has been performed on simplebinary alloy systems containing only a single solute. Among these systems are alloysformed by adding either copper, silver, or zinc to aluminum. In the ﬁrst of these systems,that is Al-Cu, the solute atom (copper) has a diameter about 12 percent larger than thealuminum atom. In the other two systems, the solute atom differs in size from that of thesolvent by only about one percent.
A signiﬁcant feature of precipitation hardening, even in the binary systems, is that the
precipitating phase normally does not originate in its ﬁnal stable form. In other words, theprecipitate often passes through several stages before a ﬁnal stable structure appears. Thus,16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 503

in an aluminum 16 percent silver
alloy. (Reprinted from Nicholson,R.B., and Nutting, J., Acta. Met . 9
332 [1961] with permission ofElsevier. Photgraph courtesy of RB Nicholson. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00016160)for example, an alloy of aluminum containing 4 percent copper may pass through three
different intermediate precipitation stages before the ﬁnal stable /H9008phase (CuAl2) is
attained. The ﬁrst of these stages involves local clustering of the solute atoms to form whatare commonly called Guinier-Preston or GP zones . These zones or clusters are favored by a
low aging temperature, a small atomic size misﬁt, and a high degree of solute supersatu-ration. The shape that these clusters or zones take is strongly inﬂuenced by the amount ofthe misﬁt that occurs when the solute atom is placed in the parent lattice. When this issmall, as in aluminum-silver alloys, where the silver atoms are almost the same size as thealuminum atoms and the two atom diameters differ by less than 1 percent, the GP zonestend to be spherical in shape. An example of nearly spherical GP zones, in an aluminum16 percent silver alloy, is shown in Fig. 16.8. Note that these GP zones are clearly visiblein the electron micrograph made at a magniﬁcation of 100,000 /H11003. In the aluminum-cop-
per system, on the other hand, the misﬁt between the solute and the matrix lattice is muchlarger since there is about a 12 percent difference between the sizes of the copper and alu-minum atoms. This larger misﬁt signiﬁes a much larger lattice strain when GP zones forminside the matrix. As a consequence, the GP zones tend to form as very thin, two-dimen-sional plates oriented parallel to the {100} aluminum lattice planes. Thus, in the Al-Agalloy where the strain energy associated with a zone is small, the clusters tend to take ashape that minimizes the surface energy, while in the Al-Cu alloy where the strain energyis large, the zones assume a shape that tends to minimize their volume and the strainenergy of the zones.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 504

5 nmThe plate-like Al-Cu GP zones may have a diameter or length as large as 10 nm 
(100 Å) but a thickness of only a few tenths of a nanometer (several Å). This means
that the thickness of the GP zones in the copper-aluminum alloy is of the order of a few
layers of copper atoms. Figure 16.9 shows a high-resolution electron micrograph of GP
zones recorded in the /H20855110/H20856zone axis for Al–1.4 at % Cu.4Eighteen GP zones can be
seen in the ﬁgure, with 15 of them appearing in bright contrast and the remaining
three dark.
If an aluminum-copper alloy is naturally aged , that is, aged at room temperature, all
of the hardening that it undergoes comes from only the formation of Guinier-Preston
zones. The zones begin to appear very soon after the start of aging. The rate at which they
appear is initially very rapid but decreases with increasing time. The number of zones
eventually approaches a maximum as the metal becomes fully aged. In other words,
room-temperature aging of aluminum-copper alloys involves only a single stage and the
stable uphase is not attained. Furthermore, age hardening involving only GP zones
occurs, in Al-Cu alloys, not only at room temperature but also at any aging temperatures
below roughly 100°C (373 K). In the past, this type of low temperature aging has been
called cold aging . Since the equilibrium CuAl2or uphase does not appear as a result of
cold aging, the precipitate in this case should have a metastable character. Supporting this
point of view is the fact that hardening due to cold aging in an aluminum alloy can be
removed by reheating to about 200°C (473 K), at which temperature the zones dissolve.
This phenomenon is known as reversion . Softening involving the use of reversion is
employed in some commercial operations.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 505

not only in the Al-Cu system but also in the more general sense.5The rates at which the
GP zones begin to form, at low and moderate temperatures, are very high. In order for the
zones to form this rapidly, the diffusion coefﬁcient of the solute atoms would have to be
several orders of magnitude higher than that obtained by extrapolating the known high-
temperature solute diffusion coefﬁcient to the aging temperatures. This accelerated rate of
zone formation may be explained in terms of a vacancy supersaturation retained in the
aging specimen as a result of its having been rapidly quenched from the higher solution
treatment temperature, since the equilibrium vacancy concentration is very much higher
at the solution temperature. As shown in Chapter 7, because the diffusion coefﬁcient
involves the product of the jump rate of the atoms into vacancies times the concentration
of the vacancies, a vacancy supersaturation is expected to increase the diffusion rate at the
aging temperature.
16.5 AGING OF AL-CU ALLOYS AT TEMPERATURES 
ABOVE 100°C (373 K)
The formation of Guinier-Preston zones no longer constitutes the only stage of precip-
itation hardening in an Al-Cu alloy if the aging temperature is raised to 100°C (373 K)
or above. One may now observe several intermediate stages, followed by the appear-
ance of the ﬁnal stable uor CuAl2phase. The effect of aging above 100°C is clearly
shown in Fig 16.10, where a set of isothermal aging curves of an aluminum alloy,
2014-T4, are shown. In this ﬁgure, the yield stress of the metal is plotted as a function
of the aging time in hours. This alloy contains, in addition to 4.4 percent Cu, 0.8 percent
Si, 0.8 percent Mn, and 0.5 percent Mg. The principal hardening agent of this alloy is
its copper and while it is not strictly a binary Al-Cu alloy, its aging behavior is largely
representative of the binary Al-Cu alloys. Attention is also called to the fact that the
temperatures in this diagram are expressed in degrees Fahrenheit. Note that the room
temperature curve, corresponding to hardening due only to the formation of GP zones,
shows only a slight rise in the yield stress for aging times in excess of 100 hours. The
yield stress up to an aging time of 10,000 hours also shows no indication of decreasing.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 506

above 212°F (100°C) show a yield stress that quickly rises to a maximum and then falls
rapidly at longer aging times. Aging at temperatures above room temperature is nor-
mally called artiﬁcial aging .
A significant feature of the artificially aged curves in Fig. 16.10 is that they show
it is possible to attain a higher strength (or hardness) by aging above 100°C. This gain
of strength can be retained by controlling the time that the metal is held at the higher
aging temperature. It is also worth noting that the maximum increase in strength, in
this set of curves, occurs in the 300°F (149°C) curve. Also note that as the aging tem-
perature is increased, the maximum in these curves moves to a shorter time and
decreases in height. While the aluminum 2014 alloy curves in Fig. 16.10 readily
show the difference between aging at room temperature and aging above 100°C, it
is easier to obtain useful information about the development of the intermediate
stages of aging from an isothermal aging curve of a binary Al-Cu alloy. Figure 16.11
shows such a curve for a binary alloy of 4.0 percent Cu that was aged for various
times at 130°C. In this figure the diamond pyramid hardness (DPH) is plotted
against the time of aging measured in days. The initial rise of the curve that begins
after the start of aging and extends to a time of one hour, as well as the plateau that
follows this rise, are associated with the development of Guinier-Preston zones.
However, X-ray dif fraction studies have revealed that the second rise is accompanied
by the formation of a new structure. Originally, this intermediate structure was called
GP(2), but later authors have tended to identify it by the symbol u/H11032/H11032since it has the
characteristics of a three-dimensional ordered phase. It also consists of plates that lie
along aluminum {100} planes, but these plates now have a thickness of several
atomic layers. It is interesting to note that the sizes or diameters of the u/H11032/H11032plates are
larger than those of the GP zones. In this specific alloy they may become at least four
to five times larger in diameter than the GP zones. As indicated in Fig. 16.11, the GP
zone and u/H11032/H11032structures can be seen to overlap each other for a short part of the16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 507

FIG. 16.12 Precipitation sequence in Al-Cu alloysisothermal aging curve. A greater amount of overlap is apparent between the next
intermediate structure, u/H11032, and the u/H11032/H11032structure. Note that the maximum hardness
(or strength) of the alloy is attained when the u/H11032/H11032constituent is close to its maximum
amount. It should be pointed out that the peak aged microstructure consists of both
u/H11032/H11032and u/H11032precipitates.6–8The u/H11032precipitate has a composition that is the same or very
close to that of the stable u(CuAl2) phase and its crystal structure is also tetragonal
like that of the uphase. The primary difference between these two structures is that
u/H11032precipitates are partially coherent with the lattice of the aluminum matrix, while
the uprecipitates are incoherent. Figure 16.11 shows that the growth of the u/H11032parti-
cles is accompanied by a loss in hardness. This is a result of the fact that as the par-
ticles grow in size, they decrease in number and there is a general loss in the strength
of the coherency strain. Eventually, with increasing aging time, the stable and inco-
herent uphase replaces the coherent u/H11032precipitate and the alloy becomes softened to
well below its maximum strength.7
It is now possible to draw a small diagram, as shown in Fig. 16.12, giving the stages in
the development of the precipitates in the Al-Cu precipitation hardening alloys.
1. Supersaturated alpha phase.
2. Guinier-Preston zones. This is the ﬁnal precipitate below 100°C.
3. The u/H11032/H11032intermediate precipitate structure.
4. The u/H11032intermediate precipitate structure.
5. The stable uphase, Cu2Al, in a matrix of the equilibrium alpha phase.
The interrelations of these structures are not well understood.9That is, it has not
always been possible to determine whether the various precipitate structures evolve
directly from each other in sequence or whether they are separately nucleated. In the
case of the intermediate structure u/H11032/H11032, which replaces the GP zones, the size of this pre-
cipitate particle is much greater than that of the GP zones. As a consequence, many of
the GP zones must dissolve and release their solute atoms in order to form one of the
u/H11032/H11032particles. Thus, the question of whether a u/H11032/H11032platelet forms from a GP zone or not is
somewhat academic. In addition, it was shown earlier by Guinier that depending on
the degree of supersaturation, the ﬁnal stable uprecipitate may form as a result of a
direct transformation from the u/H11032structure or nucleate directly from the matrix solid
solution. Also, it has been deduced as a result of the work of Silcock, Heal, and Hardy616Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 508

that, given the correct conditions, the ﬁrst structure that appears may be either GP
zones, u/H11032/H11032, or u/H11032. This may be interpreted as evidence that all these structures are capa-
ble of being independently nucleated.
16.6 PRECIPITATION SEQUENCES IN OTHER 
ALUMINUM ALLOYS
The aluminum-silver system has been studied by a number of investigators. These haveshown

appears to be as follows:
(1) Supersatured a:(2) spherical clusters (as in Fig. 16.8) :(3) ordered 
clusters :(4) g/H11032:(5) stable gphase and equilibrium a
Studies of the precipitation sequences have been made on a number of other alu-
minum alloy systems. For the most part, these have concerned alloy systems on whichimportant commercial precipitation hardening aluminum alloys are based. They includethe following: (1) aluminum-copper-magnesium alloys, (2) aluminum-magnesium-siliconalloys, (3) aluminum-zinc-magnesium alloys, and (4) aluminum-zinc-magnesium-copperalloys. Three of the above involve ternary systems and the other is a quaternary system.As a consequence, the studies have been complex and the results in many cases not welldeﬁned. Therefore, they will not be considered here. Information on this subject may beobtained in standard texts.

In the aluminum precipitation hardening alloys, the precipitate particles normally
only become visible in an optical microscope when the metal is in an advanced stage ofoveraging. However, some of the intermediate stages can often be resolved in an electronmicroscope. Thus, for example, the GP zones of the Al-Ag system can be observed in theelectron micrograph of Fig. 16.8. Another example of an intermediate structure is shownin Fig. 16.13. In this case, the plate-like g/H11032structure in an Al-Ag-Zn alloy is clearly resolved
at a magniﬁcation of 35,000 /H11003in an electron micrograph. The g/H11032precipitate represents the
second of the three intermediate stages of precipitation. The dark lines that may be seencrossing some of the g/H11032plates are probably dislocations lying on the interface between the
particle and the matrix.
As evidenced by the photographs in Figs. 16.8 and 16.13, the transmission electron
microscope is a useful tool for the study of precipitation phenomena. In addition to mak-ing possible the direct observation of very small precipitate structures, it is sometimes pos-sible to use selected area diffraction to deduce the nature of the crystal structure in theprecipitate particles. This requires that the particles be large enough to be able to give adiffraction pattern. Very small particles cannot be studied in this manner. For their analy-sis, the best techniques still rely heavily on X-ray diffraction. Since the problems associ-ated with precipitation are complex, it is often necessary to invoke other techniques inaddition to those mentioned above. These involve changes in physical properties such ashardness and electrical resistivity, induced by the various phenomena of precipitation.With regard to electrical resistivity, the orderly motion of electrons through a crystal,which constitutes an electric current, is badly disturbed when an extremely small and uni-formly distributed precipitate, such as the GP zones, forms. Thus, when precipitation startsthere is an initial large rise in resistivity, which then decreases as the average particle sizeincreases during the progress of the precipitation phenomena.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 509

Another type of physical measurement that can give valuable information about pre-
cipitation phenomena is internal friction . The use of the torsion pendulum to determine inter-
stitial diffusion coefﬁcients is described in Chapter 13. The torsion pendulum, or other more
sophisticated internal friction measuring devices, may also be used to measure the concen-tration of an interstitial solute in solid solution in an alloy. To a high degree of accuracy, theinternal friction in a dilute interstitial solid solution alloy specimen is due only to the soluteatoms in solution. Furthermore, the magnitude of the internal friction, which can be meas-ured by a parameter such as d
max, the maximum logarithmic decrement (see Fig. 13.9), is a
direct measure of the amount of solute in solution. Thus, when an interstitial solid solutionalloy is undergoing precipitation, one can follow the amount of the solute being transferredfrom the solution to the precipitate particles by measuring the decrease in d
maxthat accom-
panies this transfer. As a speciﬁc example, consider a supersaturated ferrite solid solution,obtained by quenching an iron specimen containing 0.01 percent carbon from 950 K toroom temperature. The transfer of carbon atoms from the solid solution to the cementiteprecipitate particles that occurs on subsequent aging of the specimen at room temperaturecan be followed by measurements of d
maxsince the cementite precipitate depends only on
the concentration of the carbon in the ferrite and is, accordingly, independent of the carboncontained in the cementite particles. It is interesting to note that the early data of Wert, usedin plotting Fig. 16.1, were obtained in this way. In the alloy systems, where this internal fric-tion method is applicable, it forms an excellent means for studying precipitation effects.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 510
511 16.7 Homogeneous Versus Heterogeneous Nucleation of Precipitates
16.7 HOMOGENEOUS VERSUS HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEATION
OF PRECIPITATES
A precipitate particle can be nucleated, as in other types of phase transformations, either
heterogeneously or homogeneously. Heterogeneous nucleation of precipitates is largelyassociated with dislocations, dislocation nodes (intersections of two or more dislocations),impurity particles, and discontinuities on grain boundaries. Homogeneous nucleation, onthe other hand, involves the spontaneous formation of nuclei as a result of compositionﬂuctuations in the matrix that are large enough to cause a second-phase particle to formin an otherwise perfect crystal.
As mentioned in Chapter 15, homogeneous nucleation is usually difﬁcult to
achieve and heterogeneous nucleation normally is favored. However, homogeneousnucleation of Guinier-Preston zones is believed to be possible in a basically continuouscrystal lattice, provided a critical vacancy concentration exists. In other words, nucle-ation, as a result of the formation of vacancy-solute atom clusters, is consistent withexperimental data under certain combinations of solution temperatures and quenchingrates. It has also been proposed that at low temperatures
11(below 100°C) the critical
nucleus size for a GP zone may be so small that the incubation time for a nucleus effec-tively vanishes. This would account for the rapid growth rates of the zones at thesetemperatures. GP zones may also form by spinoidal transformation, for which there is
no barrier for nucleation.
Not all alloy systems exhibit the precipitation phenomena found in precipitation
hardening aluminum alloys. For these other systems the formal theory for the nucleationof solid-state precipitates is still very important. This theory was covered in Sec. 15.4.A topic that was not covered in Sec. 15.4 was the effect of temperature on the homo-geneous nucleation process. Homogeneous nucleation requires that thermal ﬂuctua-tions produce particles large enough to exceed r
0, the critical radius (see Fig. 15.2).
Otherwise, as explained in Chapter 15, the second phase cannot nucleate. It is custom-ary to call a nucleus that is subcritical ( r/H11021r
0) in size an embryo . Let us now consider
how the size of a stable nucleus varies with temperature. With reference to the parti-cle energy equation, Eq. 15.23, it can be assumed as a ﬁrst approximation that the sur-face-energy term does not change with temperature. On the other hand, the volumeenergy varies with temperature, becoming larger at low temperatures because thedegree of supersaturation increases (solubility decreases) as the temperature falls. Thiseffect is shown qualitatively in Fig. 16.14, where it can be seen that the critical radiusdecreases with falling temperature. At temperatures just below the solvus line, r
0is
very large (approaching inﬁnity in size). The rate of homogeneous nucleation is, there-fore, very small at this temperature. As the temperature is lowered, the critical radiusrapidly decreases in size and so does the energy necessary to form a critical embryo.This latter is measured by the height ( /H9004G
r0) of the energy curve maxima in Fig. 16.14.
Homogeneous nucleation is thus made easier by a drop in temperature, whichexplains why ice must be supercooled to such a low temperature if heterogeneous
nucleation is precluded. On the other hand, in precipitation reactions, nucleation alsodepends on the ability of the solute to diffuse through the lattice of the solvent. Thisbecomes the controlling factor at very low temperatures. When diffusion effectivelybecomes negligible, so does precipitation.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 511
Chapter 16 Precipitation Hardening 512
16.8 INTERPHASE PRECIPITATION
A different type of precipitation, called interphase precipitation , will now be considered. It is
of considerable importance in the ﬁeld of high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels. These
steels are not simple binary alloys, since the simplest of them contains at least one other
component that normally interacts strongly with the carbon in the alloy. The most impor-
tant of these elements are vanadium, titanium, niobium, chromium, molybdenum, and
tungsten. All have a strong afﬁnity for carbon and, as a result, are commonly known as
carbide formers . Thus, in a typical low alloy that contains vanadium in addition to carbon,
vanadium carbide, VC, will tend to form instead of iron carbide, Fe3C.
In order to understand the complete nature of interphase precipitation, it is perhaps sim-
plest to ﬁrst consider the binary iron-carbon diagram, which is usually presented showing
the phase relations between iron and the intermediate (metastable) phase iron-carbide, Fe3
C, normally called cementite . The complete iron-iron carbide diagram is shown in Fig. 18.1.
Note that Fig. 16.1 is merely an expanded view of the lower left-hand corner of Fig. 18.1. A
more extensive view of this part of the phase diagram is given in Fig. 16.15. This extends up
into the higher temperature region where the gor face-centered cubic phase, known as
austenite , is stable. Now consider an alloy of iron with 0.15 percent carbon that has been
heated up to point ain Fig. 16.15 and left at this temperature long enough to form a homo-
geneous austenitic solid solution. On slow cooling this alloy enters the two-phase a/H11001b
region at point band and leaves it at point c. Just below this latter point it enters the alpha
(bcc) solid solution phase or ferrite region. Thus, on slow cooling the transformation from g
to aoccurs, as might be expected, between points band c. This transformation requires time
or slow cooling. Very rapid cooling or quenching a specimen from ato a point such as dand
then holding it at point dwill tend to suppress the gto atransformation during cooling and
allow it to occur isothermally at the temperature of d. In the HSLA steels where interphase
precipitation occurs, the binary iron-carbon diagram is not strictly applicable because the car-
bide that forms is not cementite but one of the alloy carbides such as vanadium carbide (VC),
niobium carbide (NbC), or titanium carbide (TiC). However, in these steels, a rapid quench
from the austenite region to the ferrite region followed by a period of isothermal aging willr0ΔGr0

will be a precipitation of the carbide that does not occur in the simple binary iron-carbon alloy.
Now consider a steel containing 0.15 percent carbon and 0.75 percent vanadium.
Such a steel would be heated high into the austenite region to a temperature of about
1150°C and held at this temperature until a uniform austenitic structure was obtained.
The next step in the procedure would consist of a rapid cool or quench to a temperature
between 700 and 850°C. The specimen then would be allowed to age at this latter tem-
perature. During this aging period an isothermal transformation from the gamma phase to
the alpha phase occurs. Also during this transformation the precipitation of the alloy car-
bide, VC, occurs. This precipitate is nucleated on the interface between the ferrite and the
austenite. The boundary between the austenite and the ferrite is frequently planar, but this
is not always true. The transformation of the austenite to the ferrite occurs primarily 
by the movement of ledges that sweep along the boundary as suggested in Fig. 16.16. 16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 513

aging the specimen at this temperature for 
5 min. (From Batte, A. D., and Honeycombe,
R. W. K., J. Iron Steel Inst ., 211284 [1973].)In the general case, these ledges can have a height of between 5 and 50 nm depending
on the isothermal transformation temperature and the composition of the specimen.
As a ledge moves across the interface, a band of metal is transformed from austenite to
ferrite, with a thickness equal to the ledge height. The ledge front is believed to move
too rapidly for the alloy carbide precipitates to nucleate on the front itself. However,
this is not true of the gamma-alpha interface, which lies behind the moving ledge front.
This interface remains effectively stationary until the next ledge sweeps across so
that the precipitates have time to form on this interphase boundary. They nucleate on
the interface and then grow into the alpha phase. The precipitates continue to grow
as the ledge front moves away from them with the result that the sizes of the particles
increase as the front continues to move. The transformation of austenite into ferrite is a
repeating process so that as the transformation continues additional ledges appear in a
regular fashion and move across the interface. A schematic ﬁgure due to Honeycombe
that shows this process appears in Fig. 16.16. A photomicrograph showing a regular
arrangement of precipitates, in rows due to interphase precipitation, in a low-alloy
steel containing 0.15 percent C and 0.75 percent V is shown in Fig. 16.17. This speci-

ature for 5 minutes.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 514

movement of dislocations through a crystal 
containing precipitate particles16.9 THEORIES OF HARDENING
The crystallographic nature of the precipitate particles that form during the various
stages of precipitation are now much better understood than they were a few years ago.
However, the exact nature of the hardening process is still not completely resolved. It
appears that there are at least several hardening mechanisms, and that what is predom-
inant in one alloy is not necessarily important in another. In general, however, it
may be said that an increase in hardness is synonymous with an increased difﬁculty of
moving dislocations. Either a dislocation must cut through the precipitate particles in
its path, or it must move between them. In either case, it can be shown that a stress
increase is needed to move the dislocations through a lattice containing precipitate par-
ticles. Thus, the Orowan mechanism illustrated in Fig. 16.18 was proposed to explain
the interaction of dislocations with precipitate particles that have grown large enough
for dislocation segments to be able to bend and pass between adjacent particles. It is,
accordingly, applicable to the later stages of aging. In this mechanism the dislocation is
assumed to form expanding loops around the precipitate particles, which cancel as in
a Frank-Read source. This cancellation permits the dislocation to continue its motion,
but leaves a dislocation ring around the particle whose stress ﬁeld adds resistance to the
motion of the next dislocation.
It is believed by many that an important factor in the interaction between precipitate
particles and dislocations is the presence of stress ﬁelds surrounding precipitate particles.
This is especially true when the precipitate particle is coherent with the matrix.
Overaging is softening resulting from prolonged aging (see Fig. 16.6). In some age-
hardening alloys, it appears concurrently with the loss of coherency by the precipitate. In
any case, it may be stated that it is connected with the continued growth of precipitate
particles. Growth will continue as long as the metal is maintained at a ﬁxed temperature.
This does not mean that all particles continue to grow, while others (the smaller ones)
disappear. It merely means that certain particles (the larger ones) continue to grow, while
others (the smaller ones), disappear. As aging progresses, the size of the average particle
increases, but the number of particles decreases. Maximum hardening is associated with
an optimum small-particle size and a corresponding large number of particles, while
overaging is associated with few relatively large particles.
The growth of precipitate particles is directly related to the surface tension at the
interface between the matrix and the particles. Because of the boundary-surface energy,
the free energy per atom in a large precipitate particle is lower than that in a small
particle. This free-energy difference is the driving force that causes the dissolution of
small particles and the growth of large ones. A simple derivation of this relationship will
now be given.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 515

First, assume that the precipitate has a spherical shape, like that shown in Fig. 16.19.
The energy of a particle can then be expressed by Eq. 15.2, assuming that the strain energy
is small enough to be ignored. Thus,
/H9004G/H11005A1r3/H11001A2r216.1
This is the total energy of a given amount of precipitate. The energy per unit volume of
the precipitate is the above quantity divided by the volume of the particle, or

where /H9004G/H11032is the energy per unit volume,
The energy per atom of the precipitate is proportional to the energy per unit volume,
so that

where /H9004GAis the free-energy change per atom. This quantity varies inversely as the radius
of the particle. The larger the radius, the more negative the free energy of the second-
phase atom and, therefore, the more stable it is in the precipitate. Conversely, the smaller
the radius, the less stable it is. Under conditions such as these, solute atoms tend to leave
smaller particles and enter the matrix, while at the same time they leave the matrix to
enter the larger particles. Diffusion of solute through the matrix makes it possible for this
process to continue.
16.10 ADDITIONAL FACTORS IN PRECIPITATION HARDENING
In many alloys, precipitation-hardening phenomena are made even more complicated
by the fact that nucleation occurs both homogeneously and heterogeneously. Preferred
locations for heterogeneous nucleation in these alloys are grain boundaries and slip
planes. Since heterogeneous signiﬁes easier nucleation, precipitation tends to occur/H9004Ga/H11015A/H110321/H11001A/H110322

Depleted matrix FIG. 16.20 Heterogeneous nucleation at grain
boundaries. (A) Moderate rate of cooling may
result in both heterogeneous nucleation at grain
boundaries and homogeneous nucleation in the
centers of the grains. (B) Very slow cooling may
result in the precipitate occurring only at grain
boundariesmore rapidly at these locations. This introduces a time lag between the aging responses
in areas undergoing heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleations, and overaging fre-
quently occurs at the grain boundaries long before precipitation in the matrix has had
a chance to develop fully. Another effect of rapid precipitation at grain boundaries is
that precipitate particles may grow large in size and, as a result, deplete the solute from
the areas adjacent to the boundaries. A band of metal, free of precipitation, is then left
on each side of the boundary (see Fig. 16.20A). This effect can be greatly magniﬁed if
the alloy is heated to the solution-treating temperature and slowly cooled. On slow
cooling, nucleation starts at temperatures just below the solvus line at points of easy
nucleation, as for example, grain boundaries. At the same time, homogeneous nucle-
ation is prevented because of the negligible rate for this form of nucleation at tem-
peratures close to the solvus line. On continued slow cooling, the grain-boundary
precipitate continues to grow through diffusion of solute from the matrix to the
precipitate. At the same time, the solute concentration in the matrix is continually
reduced and the solution never becomes greatly supersaturated. In this manner, nearly
all of the solute ﬁnds its way to the second phase in the boundaries and general
precipitation in the matrix does not occur. Figure 16.20B is representative of a slowly
cooled alloy with grain-boundary precipitation.
Heterogeneous nucleation on slip planes is frequently induced by quenching stresses
that develop when the metal is rapidly cooled from the solution-treating temperature.
Relief of these stresses through plastic deformation by slip leaves large numbers of dislo-
cation segments along slip planes, which act as loci for heterogeneous nucleation.
Precipitation phenomena are sometimes further complicated by the occurrence of
recrystallization during the formation of the precipitate. When this happens, it is the matrix
that recrystallizes; matrix atoms regroup to form new crystals.
Finally, it should be pointed out that precipitate particles are not always spherical in
shape. Frequently, the precipitate has a plate-like, or even a needle-like, form. In many
cases plate- or needle-shaped precipitate particles grow in such a manner that they are
aligned along speciﬁc crystallographic planes or directions of the matrix crystals.
Interesting geometrical patterns may result from this type of precipitate growth. It is cus-
tomary to call such formations Widmanstätten structures . Figure 16.21 shows schemati-
cally a typical Widmanstätten structure.16Ch16.qxd  11/6/08  3:55 PM  Page 517

16.7 The Orowan mechanism, which explains the hard-

Thestrengthening arises from the fact that the dislocationsmust bow out between two neighboring precipitate par-ticles. This bowing out is opposed by the line tension ofthe dislocations. Ashby has deduced an equation givingthe stress needed to move dislocations under conditionsconforming to the Orowan model. An equation givingthis stress, which assumes that the precipitate particlesare spherical and that the system involves iron contain-ing carbon, may be found in Leslie, W.

521We shall now consider two apparently unrelated types of phenomena that actually have
much in common. One, deformation or mechanical twinning, is a mode of plastic defor-mation, while the other, comprising martensite reactions, is a basic type of phase transfor-mation. Twinning, like slip, occurs as the result of applied stresses. Sometimes stress maybe inﬂuential in partly triggering a martensitic transformation, but this is an effect of sec-ondary importance. Martensite reactions occur in metals that undergo phase transforma-tions, and the driving force for a martensite reaction is the chemical free-energy differencebetween two phases.
The similarity between martensite reactions and twinning lies in the analogous way
twins and martensite crystals form, for, in both cases, the atoms inside ﬁnite crystallinevolumes of the parent phase are realigned as new crystal lattices. In twins this realignmentreproduces the original crystal structure, but with a new orientation. In a martensite plate,not only is a new orientation produced, but also a basically different crystalline structure.Thus, when martensite forms in steel quickly cooled to room temperature, the face-centered cubic phase, which is stable at elevated temperatures, is converted into smallcrystalline units of a body-centered tetragonal phase. On the other hand, when twinningoccurs in a metal such as zinc, both the parent crystal and the twinned volumes still havethe close-packed hexagonal zinc structure. In both twinning and martensite transforma-tions, each realigned volume of material suffers a change in shape that distorts the sur-rounding matrix. The changes in shape are quite similar, so that martensitic plates anddeformation twins look alike, taking the form of small lenses, or plates. Examples of defor-mation twins and martensite plates are shown in Fig. 17.1. Actually, as shall presently beseen, it is quite possible to convert large volumes of the parent structure into elements ofone of the new structures, but the plate-like shapes shown in Fig. 17.1 are much morecommon.
17.1 DEFORMATION TWINNING
The deformation accompanying mechanical twinning is simpler than that associated withmartensitic reactions because there is no change in crystal structure, merely a reorientationof the lattice. The change of shape associated with deformation twinning is a simple shear,as shown in Fig. 17.2A, where, for simplicity, it is assumed that the twin traverses the entirecrystal. The difference between twinning and slip should be carefully recognized since, inboth cases, the lattice is sheared. In slip, the deformation occurs on individual lattice planes,as indicated in Fig. 17.2B. When measured on a single slip plane, this shear may be manytimes larger than the lattice spacing and depends on the number of dislocations emitted by

the dislocation source. The shear associated with deformation twinning, on the other hand,
is uniformly distributed over a volume rather than localized on a discrete number of slip
planes. Here, in contrast to slip, the atoms move only a fraction of an interatomic spacing
relative to each other. The total shear deformation due to twinning is also small, so that17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 522

FIG. 17.3 Schematic representation showing
how a twin may be produced by a simple 
movement of atomsnormally slip is a much more important primary mode of plastic deformation. Nevertheless,
the importance of mechanical twinning is becoming increasingly more apparent in explain-
ing certain elusive mechanical properties of many metals. For example, when a metal
twins, the lattice inside the twin is frequently realigned into an orientation where the slip
planes are more favorably aligned with respect to the applied stress. Under certain condi-
tions, a heavily twinned metal can be more easily deformed than one free of twins. On the
other hand, lattice realignment, if conﬁned to a limited number of twins, can induce frac-
ture by permitting very large deformations to occur inside the conﬁned limits of twins.
Twins are also of importance in recrystallization phenomena, for the intersections of twins
are preferred positions for the nucleation of new grains during annealing.
A good insight into the mechanics of twinning can be gained by studying the simple
diagrams of Fig. 17.3. The twinning represented in these sketches is only schematic and
does not refer to twinning in any real crystal. The upper diagram represents a crystal17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 523

(B)shows a twinning shear that has occurred
as a result of the forcestructure composed of atoms assumed to have the shape of oblate spheroids. The lower
diagram represents the same crystal after it has undergone a shearing action that pro-
duced a twin. The twin is formed by the rotation of each atom in the deformed area about
an axis through its center and perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Three atoms are
marked with the symbols a, b, and cin both diagrams to show their relative positions
before and after the shear. Notice that individual atoms are shifted very little with respect
to their neighbors. While it is in no way implied that the atom movements in a real crys-
tal are the same as those shown in Fig. 17.3, it is true that in all cases the movement of
an atom relative to its neighbors is very small. The two parts of Fig. 17.3 show another
important characteristic of twinning: the lattice of the twin is a mirror image of the par-
ent lattice. The lattices of twin and parent are symmetrically oriented across a symmetry
plane called the twinning plane . The several ways that this symmetry can be attained will
be discussed in the next section.
17.2 FORMAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC THEORY OF TWINNING
The formal crystallographic theory of twinning in metals has been summarized by Cahn1
and the following treatment is largely based on his presentation.
Let us assume that shearing forces are applied to a single crystal specimen, as indicated
on the left in Fig. 17.4, and that, as a result of this applied force, the crystal is sheared. The
resulting shape of the crystal is shown in the second drawing. Furthermore, assume that
after deformation, the sheared section still has the structure and symmetry of the original
crystal. In other words, this region is to retain, after shearing, all the crystallographic prop-
erties of the metal of which it is composed, so that the size and shape of the unit cell must
be unchanged. According to crystallographic theory, the size and shape of the unit cell will
be unchanged only if it is possible to ﬁnd three noncoplanar, rational lattice vectors in the
original crystal that have the same lengths and mutual angles after shearing.
Figure 17.5 shows an edge view of a volume that has been sheared. The top surface
is displaced a distance eto the right with respect to the bottom surface, and crystallographic
planes with orientations perpendicular to the plane of the paper, such as B, C, and D, are
rotated to new positions. Original positions of the planes, in each case, are indicated by
dotted lines, and the ﬁnal positions by solid lines. The only plane whose dimensions have
not changed as a consequence of the shear is plane C. Plane Dhas been shortened and
plane Bhas been lengthened. The reason that Chas not suffered a change in shape is
because it makes the same angle /H9258with the base both before and after the shear. This plane
is unique and, except for the plane deﬁning the top and bottom surfaces of the sheared
section, it is the only plane whose shape is not changed by the shear.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 524

FIG. 17.5 The edge view of a small rectangular volume that has suffered a
shear deformation as a result of the applied shearing forces. The dashed
lines indicate the original shape of the volume; the solid lines its ﬁnal
shape. The ﬁgure is given to illustrate the change in shape of several
planes as a result of the shear. The original positions of the planes are
given with dashed lines. All three planes have orientations perpendicular
to the paper
The next three-dimensional ﬁgure, Fig. 17.6, shows several other arbitrarily chosen
planes with more general orientations than those shown in Fig. 17.5. Again the positions
of the planes before and after the shear are given (a change in shape is quite evident in
each case).
From the above, it is evident that there are only two crystallographic planes in a shear-
ing action that do not change their shape and size as a consequence of the shear. The ﬁrst
is the plane deﬁning the upper and lower surfaces of the sheared volume. This plane con-
tains the shear direction. In the case of shear by twinning, it is known either as the twin-
ning plane or as the ﬁrst undistorted plane, and is given the symbol K1. The other plane,
designated Cin Fig. 17.5, intersects K1in a line that is perpendicular to the direction of
shear and makes equal angles with K1before and after shear occurs. This is called the sec-
ond undistorted plane and its crystallographic designation is K2. In Fig. 17.7, the relation-
ship between K1and K2is graphically illustrated. Several other quantities can also be
deﬁned in terms of this ﬁgure. The shear direction is shown with an arrow and labeled
with its customary designation /H92571. The plane that lies perpendicular to K1and contains the
shear direction is known as the plane of shear . The intersection of the plane of shear with
the second undistorted plane K2is also an important direction. It is designated with an
arrow and is given the symbol /H92572. Notice that there are two positions for /H92572corresponding
to the positions of K2before and after shearing.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 525

FIG. 17.8 In this ﬁgure, which corresponds to a
shear of the ﬁrst kind, notice that /H92572makes
equal angles with an arbitrary vector /H9255, which
lies in K1, both before and after the shear. The
sheared position of the second undistorted plane
is designated K/H110322Because all other planes suffer a change in size or shape during a shear, it is only in
planes K1and K2that vectors can be found which will not be distorted by a twinning
deformation. The basic problem is to ﬁnd the possible combinations of three noncoplanar
lattice vectors, lying in K1and K2, which retain their mutual angles and magnitudes after
the shear.
Let /H9255in Fig. 17.8 be any vector in plane K1; then there is only one vector in K2that
makes the same angle with /H9255before and after the shear. This is /H92572, which is perpendicular
to the intersection of K1and K2. Since /H9255is any vector in K1, /H92572must therefore make the
same angle before and after shear with all vectors lying in K1. Finally, if the assumption is
made that K1is a rational plane (so that it contains rational directions) and that /H92572is a
rational direction, then the conditions for the unit cell to have the same size and shape
before and after shearing will have been realized.
In the same manner, it is easily seen that /H92571is the only direction in plane K1that
makes the same angle with arbitrary vectors in K2before and after shearing. This follows
from the fact that /H92571is also perpendicular to the intersection of K1and K2. The relation-
ship between /H9254(an arbitrary vector in K2) with /H92571is shown in Fig. 17.9. It can, therefore,
be concluded that another condition for preservation of the lattice structure during twin-
ning is that /H92571and K2be rational.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 526

The sheared position of the second undistorted 
plane is designated K/H110322
It follows from the above that there are three ways that a crystal lattice can be sheared
while still retaining its crystal structure and symmetry:
1. When K1is a rational plane and /H92572a rational direction. (A twin of the ﬁrst kind)
2. When K2is a rational plane and /H92571a rational direction. (A twin of the second
kind)
3. When all four elements K1, K2, /H92571, and /H92572are rational. (A compound twin)
The lattice rotations that occur as a result of twinning are different, depending upon
whether a twin of the ﬁrst or the second kind is formed.
In a twin of the ﬁrst kind, the lattice in the sheared section is related to that in the
unsheared section by a rotation of 180° about the normal to K1. This effect is shown in 
Fig. 17.10. The corresponding 180° rotation in a twin of the second kind is about /H92571as an
axis. This is illustrated in Fig. 17.11. On a stereographic projection, the two rotations
would appear as shown in Fig. 17.12. In a compound twin, due to symmetry considera-
tions, both types of rotation lead to the same ﬁnal orientation.

FIG. 17.12 Comparison of the lattice rotations in twins of the ﬁrst and second kinds. In 
(A), which corresponds to a twin of the ﬁrst kind, a rational lattice direction is rotated 180°
about the pole of K1. In (B), the rotation is 180° about /H92571for a twin of the second kind
The plane of shear is the plane that is mutually perpendicular to K1and K2and con-
tains /H92571and /H92572.
The composition plane is the plane separating the sheared and unsheared regions. In
actual twins, it is usually close to K1.
/H9253is the shear and equals the shear strain.
A twin that occurs inside another twin is called a second-order twin .
Twins of the second kind are relatively rare in metals and occur only in crystals of
low symmetry. Cahn1has identiﬁed one such twin in uranium. They are also found in
salts and minerals of orthorhombic or lower symmetry. In metals of high symmetry, with
cubic or close-packed hexagonal lattices, the twins generally belong to the compound
classiﬁcation.
From the above theory, it becomes apparent that the orientation of the lattice after
twinning is given by a rotation of 180° about either /H92571, or the normal to K1, depending
on the kind of twinning involved. On the other hand, the size and sense of shear are
determined by the second undistorted plane K2. It should also be noted that the shear
in twinning, as contrasted to slip, is polar, that is, it can occur in only one direction.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 528

FIG. 17.13 The cause for the difference in shear sense for {10 2} twin-
ning in zinc and magnesium. Notice that K2, before twinning, lies to the
left of the vertical in zinc, but in magnesium it is on the right. Symmetry
conditions require that K2rotate in different directions for these two
metals. The angles given in these ﬁgures have been expressed in whole
numbers for the sake of simplicity1The relationship between the shear and the second undistorted plane can be illus-
trated by a simple example. Consider the case of hexagonal metals. The common form of
twinning in these metals is a compound twin in which we have
In zinc the c/a ratio is 1.856, while in magnesium it is 1.624. Because of this difference
there is a 46.98° angle between the basal plane and the {10 2} planes in zinc, and a 43.15°
angle in magnesium. Figure 17.13 shows how this affects twinning in these two metals.
The parts of Fig. 17.13 are drawn so that the plane of the paper is the plane of shear.
Symmetry conditions require that the second undistorted plane, K2, be rotated clockwise
in the case of zinc, and counterclockwise in magnesium. This has the effect, in the former
case, of lengthening the crystal inside the twinned volume in a direction parallel to the
basal plane. In magnesium on the other hand, the effect is reversed and the crystal is short-
ened in this direction. Figure 17.14 illustrates the fact that a tensile stress parallel to the
basal plane in zinc favors {10 2} twinning. In magnesium, the sense of shear is such that
twinning is favored by compression and not tension in this direction.
Mechanical twins have been observed in all the basic metal crystal structures. This
includes both face-centered and body-centered cubic crystals. In some face-centered pure
cubic metals, deformation twins are observed only at very low temperatures and at very
large strains. Before Blewitt, Coltman, and Redman2observed twins in copper deformed
at 4.2 K in 1957, it was generally believed that fcc metals probably did not twin.
However, since that time, mechanical twinning has been observed in many fcc metals.
Twins in face-centered cubic metals form on {111} planes and the shear direction is /H2085511/H20856.
In body-centered cubic metals, the twinning plane, K1, is {112}, while /H92571is /H2085511/H20856.
Twins in body-centered cubic metals are also primarily observed at low temperatures
where they may be a signiﬁcant factor in the deformation and fracture mechanics.1211h1/H11005 [1011]        h2 /H11005 [1011]K1/H11005 (101 2)         K2 /H11005 (1012)17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 529

as tetragonal /H9252-tin, orthorhombic uranium, and rhombohedral arsenic, antimony, and
bismuth. A comprehensive review of twinning in various structures can be found in an
article by Christian and Mahajan.3
17.3 TWIN BOUNDARIES
Let us now consider the interface between a twin and the parent crystal. The atomic
arrangement at a twin boundary in a face-centered cubic metal is shown in Fig. 17.15. This
diagram assumes that the twin interface is exactly parallel to the twinning plane K1. In this
structure, the two lattices (twin and parent) match perfectly at the interface. Atoms on
either side of the boundary have the normal interatomic separation expected in a face-
centered cubic lattice. The stacking sequence of the close-packed planes is

The interfacial energy of the boundary is very small. In the case of copper, it has been
determined4to be 0.044 J/m2, which is very much smaller than the surface energy of a
copper-copper grain boundary,5which is 0.646 J/m2. Barrett6has drawn diagrams similar
to that of Fig. 17.15 for {10 2} twins in hexagonal metals and {112} twins in body-
centered cubic metals. He shows that in both cases a reasonable match between twin and
parent lattices can be made across K1. However, atoms on both sides of the interface are dis-
placed small distances from their normal lattice positions. Because atomic bonds are strained
in these twin interfaces, they must possess higher interfacial energies than the {111} twin
boundary of face-centered cubic metals. However, these energies are still much smaller than
those of normal grain boundaries. The fact that deformation twins invariably form on planes
of low indices may be explained in terms of the surface energy associated with the interface
between twins and parent crystals. In general, the higher the indices, the poorer the ﬁt at the
interface, the higher the surface energy, and the lower the probability of twin formation.
A twin boundary that parallels the twinning plane is said to be a coherent boundary.
Most twins start as thin narrow plates that become more and more lens-shaped as they
grow. The average twin boundary is, accordingly, incoherent.
In a coherent boundary it is usually quite possible to match the two lattices without
assuming the presence of dislocations in the boundaries. (See Fig. 17.15.) In an actual
boundary where it is not coherent, it is generally accepted that a dislocation array is nec-
essary in order to adjust the mismatch between lattices of parent and twin. This is demon-
strated in Fig. 17.16, which shows schematically segments of both a coherent boundary
and an incoherent boundary.
17.4 TWIN GROWTH
The formation of a twin involves not only the creation of a pair of surfaces, but also the
accommodation of the twinning shear by the lattice surrounding the twin. As the twin
grows, it normally becomes more lenticular and its surface acquires an array of twinning
dislocations. As may be seen by considering Fig. 17.16, the movement of the dislocations in
an incoherent twin boundary can result in growth of the twin. Thus, a horizontal move-
ment of the dislocations in Fig. 17.16 to the right will move the incoherent boundary to the
right, increasing the size of the twin, which is assumed to be at the bottom of the ﬁgure.
It is theoretically possible to conceive of the array of twinning dislocations lying in the
boundary of a lenticular twin as a single dislocation in the form of a helix. This is shown
schematically in Fig. 17.17. Such a dislocation can result from the dissociation of a regu-
lar lattice dislocation.
In the case of a body-centered cubic crystal, Cottrell and Bilby have proposed7that
a [111] total slip dislocation should be able to dissociate into a glissile twinning partial1

dislocation of Burgers vector [11 ] and a sessile partial dislocation [112]. This reaction
may be expressed by the equation
[111] :[112] /H11001[11 ] 17.3
In the ﬁgure, line xyrepresents the total [111] dislocation, which is assumed to be dissoci-
ated between points aand b. The straight dashed line between these two points represents
the sessile [112] partial, while the helical dislocation, with b/H11005[11 ], is the twinning dis-
location. This latter is assumed to lie on the ( 21) plane. The key to this entire picture is the
fact that the ( 21) plane spirals about the line xy. This occurs because all dislocations com-
prising the line (that is, line xaand bywhose Burgers vector is [111], and line abwith
Burgers vector [112]) have a component of their Burgers vector, normal to the ( 21)
plane, equal to the interplanar spacing of this plane. In other words, as far as the ( 21)
plane is concerned, line xyis a screw dislocation about which this plane spirals.
The schematic twin in Fig. 17.17 can grow in two ways. The twinning dislocation can
increase its number of spirals. This would correspond to a growth in thickness. The other
possibility is that the spirals themselves could expand, thereby increasing the length of the
twin lamellae. Figure 17.17 only represents a part of the Cottrell-Bilby twinning mecha-
nism. In their original paper, they also considered the nature of the original dislocation dis-
sociation that leads to this result. For the details, see the original paper.7
While there are some objections to this type of mechanism,8called a pole mechanism ,
it does indicate how a dislocation can be nucleated and grow. Pole mechanisms have also
been proposed for other crystal structures, of which a notable example is that of Venables9
for face-centered cubic crystals.
It is highly probable that if the pole mechanisms do work in metals, any given twin
probably grows as a result of a number of pole mechanisms acting together. There is no
reason why this should not be possible, and there is a good reason for assuming this;
namely the macroscopic size of the average twin is such that it must intersect a large num-
ber of slip dislocations, each of which should constitute a pole.
Twins grow in size by increasing both their length and thickness. Large volumes of
twinned material often form by the coalescence of separately nucleated twinned areas. The
speed of twin growth is primarily a function of two variables that are not entirely independ-
ent. The ﬁrst is the speed of loading that directly inﬂuences the rate of growth. The other is
the stress required to nucleate twins. If twins nucleate at very low stresses, the stress
required for their growth will be of the same order of magnitude as the nucleating stress.
In this case, a small submicroscopic twin may form and grow more or less uniformly with
an increasing stress until its growth is impeded by some means or other. On the other hand,111

if twins form under conditions that result in very high stress levels before nucleation, the
stress for growth may be much smaller than that for nucleation. When this happens, twins
grow at very rapid rates as soon as they are nucleated. Several interesting phenomena are
associated with this rapid growth. First, the rapid deformations that ensue set up shock
waves in the metal that can be heard as audible clicks. The crackling sound audible when
a bar of tin is bent is due to deformation twinning. The other effect is visible in tensile tests
of crystal specimens that undergo twinning during loading. The rapid formation of twins
results in sudden increments in tensile strain. In a rigid testing machine, this causes the load
to suddenly drop, giving the stress-strain curve a saw-tooth appearance in the region of
twinning. A stress-strain curve of this nature is shown in Fig. 17.18.
17.5 ACCOMMODATION OF THE TWINNING SHEAR
While the shear on a lattice plane is smaller in twinning than in slip, this shear becomes
macroscopic when the twin attains an appreciable width. The shear of a very thin twin
might possibly be accommodated elastically in the matrix surrounding a twin. However,
as a twin grows in size, the accommodation normally requires plastic deformation in the
surrounding metal. If the matrix is not able to accommodate the twinning shear of a twin
of ﬁnite size, then a hole may develop at the point where the accommodation was not
obtained. A well-known example occurs at twin intersections in iron and is known as a
Rose’s channel. This phenomenon was originally reported by Rose in 1868. Figure 17.19
shows one way of forming such a channel.
If a twin lies entirely inside a grain, it will usually be lenticular and thus taper to a
sharp edge at its periphery. This growth form may be assumed to be related to the shear
accommodation process, since it should be easier to accommodate the twinning shear by
slip in the matrix if the twin grows as a wedge. However, the twin shape is also undoubt-
edly inﬂuenced by the nature of the dislocation array that forms on the twin boundary.
The more tapered the twin proﬁle, the greater will be the separation between the disloca-
tions lying in the boundary.
The sharp leading edge of a twin is lost when a growing twin intersects a free sur-
face. If a twin meets a single free surface, it assumes the shape of a half-lens (Fig. 17.20),
and if it crosses a complete crystal, the twin acquires ﬂat sides parallel to the twinning
plane K1(Fig. 17.2A). In this last case, the twin can be accommodated in the lattice17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 533

where the lattice around the twins is forced to accommodate the shearing strain. In the
case of a half-lens, one commonly ﬁnds accommodation kinks adjacent to the twins. The
diagrams of Fig. 17.20 show the nature of simple accommodation kinks in the hexago-
nal metals zinc and magnesium, as viewed on a surface normal to the basal plane and
to the twins. In each case, the basal planes in the crystal adjacent to the twin are bent
or kinked so as to allow the lattice of the parent to follow the shear strain of the twin.
In some cases, serrated twin interfaces at the crystal surfaces have also been reported.10
In summary, because the twinning shear has to be accommodated, slip normally has to
play a very active role in twinning. From a broad viewpoint, we should therefore consider
twinning deformation in terms of the coupling between slip and twinning modes. It is highly
probable that twinning would not be a signiﬁcant practical means of plastic deformation in
metals such as titanium and zirconium if there was a lack of this coupling. Generally speak-
ing, this implies that twinning also involves slip. The reverse, of course, is not true.
17.6 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TWINNING IN PLASTIC
DEFORMATION
The existence of deformation twinning and its effects on mechanical properties has often
been ignored in dislocation dynamics studies. This is legitimate if deformation occurs by
slip alone. However, in many cases slip and twinning occur simultaneously and the result-
ing mechanical properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the twinning, as for example in the
important hcp metals, such as titanium, zirconium, and magnesium and in the commer-
cially signiﬁcant fcc alloys, such as brasses, bronzes, cupro-nickels, beryllium coppers, and
austenitic stainless steels.3,10–15Twin Twin

535 17.7 The Effect of Twinning on Face-Centered Cubic Stress-Strain Curves
A metal that deforms largely by deformation twinning is iron alloyed with 25 at. %
beryllium. This alloy has been extensively studied by Bolling and Richmond.16These
authors designated deformation that occurs repeatedly by twinning continual mechanical
twinning and state that it occurs when the ﬂow-stress for twinning is less than that for gross
slip. They have also shown that, at a constant strain rate, when twinning dominates over
slip the yield stress tends to rise when the temperature is increased instead of falling as isnormally the case in metals deforming by slip in the absence of dynamic strain aging.Second, at a given temperature, if the strain rate is increased, the ﬂow stress tends todecrease. This is also an inverse effect to that normally experienced when deformationoccurs primarily by slip. A third observation was that, when twinning dominates,increasing the temperature at constant strain-rate or decreasing the strain-rate at con-stant temperature can increase the work hardening rate. These are the reverse of theeffects normally expected when slip controls the deformation.
17.7 THE EFFECT OF TWINNING ON FACE-CENTERED 
CUBIC STRESS-STRAIN CURVES
It was long believed that twinning did not occur in fcc metals. However, it has been amplydemonstrated in recent years that twinning is a signiﬁcant factor in the deformation ofthese metals. In them the critical resolved shear stress for slip is normally smaller than thatto form twins. As a result, an fcc metal usually begins its deformation by slip. The workhardening resulting from this slip deformation increases the ﬂow-stress, and only after thelatter reaches the twinning stress does twinning begin.
An important factor is that the twinning stress in fcc metals depends strongly on the
stacking fault energy of these metals. This is because the surface energy of a twin bound-ary is closely related to that of a stacking fault and a large part of the work to form a twingoes into creating its boundaries. Thus, the lower the stacking fault energy of an fcc metal,the lower, in general, is the stress needed to nucleate twins.
In fcc metals, the stacking fault energy decreases with increasing concentration of a
solute in solid solution so that twinning becomes more and more signiﬁcant the higher thesolute concentration. Consequently, twinning is a signiﬁcant feature in a large number ofcommercially important and highly alloyed fcc metals. These include the brasses, bronzes,cupro-nickels, and many others.
In the low stacking fault energy fcc metals, it is possible to consider deformation twin-
ning and slip as competitive forms of plastic deformation. However, twinning differs fromslip in a number of signiﬁcant ways. Thus, the movement of a total slip dislocation leavesthe lattice behind it in perfect registry. Accordingly, there is no change in crystal orienta-tion due to the movement of slip dislocations. This is not true in twinning because thecrystal structure inside a twin has an orientation that differs from that of the parent crys-tal in which the twin formed. Although this orientation is twin-related to the matrix, andit can be shown that some slip dislocations can easily pass into the twin from the matrixor vice versa, experimental evidence strongly suggests that a twin boundary can frequentlyact like a grain boundary. Thus, twins can often be considered to reduce the grain size bysupplying additional grain boundaries.
Because slip is normally the more important of the two types of deformation, the
effect of twinning on metal plasticity is probably best considered in terms of how it per-turbs the stress-strain behavior expected from slip alone. In this regard, probably the most17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 535

hardening rate, with the true stress, /H9268, for Cu–4.9Sn at 298 Ksigniﬁcant aspect of twinning is its effect on the work hardening rate. This is particularly
true in the low stacking fault energy fcc alloys where the dissociation of the total disloca-
tions into widely extended dislocations should have a strong effect on work hardening.
There are two basic ways that twinning can inﬂuence the work hardening rate. When
twinning starts, the twins in a grain are initially aligned parallel to the primary slip plane.
This is because the slip and twinning planes in the fcc lattice are both {111}, and the most
highly stressed twinning plane is usually the same as the primary slip plane. In this case
the twins do not have a signiﬁcant effect on the movement of slip dislocations. As a result,
in a given increment of deformation, the twins add a small contribution to the strain but
not to the stress. Thus, as suggested by Vohringer,17we may write
d/H9255/H20862d/H9268/H11005(d/H9255s/H11001d/H9255t)/H20862d/H9268s17.4
where d/H9255/H20862d/H9268is the reciprocal of the work hardening rate, d/H9255sis the strain contribution due
to the slip, d/H9255tis the strain increment due to twinning, and d/H9268sis the rise in the stress due
to the slip increment. Vohringer chose the reciprocal of the work hardening rate instead
of the work hardening rate, d/H9268/H20862d/H9255, in his equation because it has some advantage in pre-
senting the experimental data. Equation 17.4 clearly implies that after twinning starts, the
reciprocal of the work hardening rate should increase (meaning that the work hardening
rate decreases). This has been conﬁrmed15by experimental data as may be seen in
Fig. 17.21, where the reciprocal of the work hardening rate, d/H9255/H20862d/H9268, is plotted against the
true stress, /H9268, for a Cu–4.9 at. % Sn specimen deformed at room temperature, 298 K. Note
that the slope of this curve rises sharply as it passes from the region marked Stage 1, where
deformation occurs by slip alone, into Stage 2, where twins form parallel to the active slip
plane. This increase in slope of the reciprocal of the work hardening rate at the transition17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 536
537 17.8 Martensite
from Stage 2 to Stage 3 signiﬁes a decrease in work hardening rate after the transition so
that with continued deformation the work hardening increases at a reduced rate. Thisslower but nevertheless continuous rise in the ﬂow stress eventually causes twins to formon twinning planes that intersect the primary twinning or slip plane. When this happens,an effective decrease in grain size occurs and the work hardening rate again increases.
17.8 MARTENSITE
When the temperature of a metal capable of undergoing a martensite reaction is lowered,it eventually passes through an equilibrium temperature separating the stability ranges oftwo different phases. Below this temperature, the free energy of the metal is lowered if themetal changes its phase from that stable at high temperatures to that stable at low temper-atures. This free-energy difference is the primary driving force for a martensite reaction.
The phase change that occurs in a martensite transformation is brought about by the
movement of the interface separating parent phase from the product. As the interfacemoves, atoms in the lattice structure of the parent phase are realigned into the lattice ofthe martensite phase. The nature of the individual atomic movements in the region con-stituting the interface are not known, just as they are not known in deformation twin-ning. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly true that the displacement of atoms, relative to theirneighbors, is small in magnitude and probably more complicated than those in deforma-tion twinning. Because of the manner in which martensite forms, no composition changeoccurs as the parent lattice is converted into the product phase and diffusion in either theparent phase or product phase is not required for the reaction to continue. Martensitereactions are, accordingly, commonly referred to as diffusionless phase transformations .
The atomic realignments associated with martensite reactions produce shape deforma-
tions just as they do in mechanical twinning. Because the new lattice that is formed has asymmetry different from that of the parent phase, the deformation is, of necessity, more com-plicated. In mechanical twinning we have seen that the distortion is a simple shear parallelto the twinning plane or the symmetry plane between twin and parent crystal. As previouslypointed out, the twinning plane is an undistorted plane; all directions in this plane areunchanged by twinning with respect to both their magnitudes and their angular separations.The habit plane or plane on which martensite plates form is also usually assumed to be an
undistorted plane. The macroscopic shape deformation in the formation of a martensite plateis believed to be a shear parallel to the habit plane plus a simple (uniaxial) tensile or compres-sive strain perpendicular to the habit plane. A strain of this nature, known as an invariant
plane strain , is the most general that can occur while still maintaining the invariance of the
habit plane. Neither a shear parallel to the habit plane, nor an extension or contraction per-pendicular to it will change the positions or magnitudes of vectors lying in the habit plane.
Data showing magnitudes of the shear and normal components of the invariant plane
strains associated with martensite reactions are difﬁcult to measure and are relativelyscarce. Some of the available information is given in Table 17.1. The normal componentof the strain in most martensite transformations is also smaller and harder to measure thanthe shear component, which probably explains the lack of data for this component inTable 17.1. Because the shape deformation is primarily a shear, martensite plates deformthe lattice of the matrix like deformation twins. Individual martensite plates, formed in theinterior of a crystal, are therefore lens-shaped, and if a martensite plate crosses a crystal,its boundaries are ﬂat and parallel to the habit plane.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 537

While the atomic movements involved in martensite reactions are small compared to
those in slip, there is considerable variation in their magnitudes from one alloy to the next.
Both the crystallographic features of a martensite transformation and the kinetics of the reac-tion are more easily studied in an alloy involving the smallest possible atomic displacement.Two well known martensite transformations ﬁt this category: those in gold-cadmium alloysand that in an indium-thallium alloy. The very important martensite reactions that occur inthe hardening of carbon and alloy steels involve relatively large atomic displacements. In thefollowing sections we shall consider an example of both an alloy in which the atomic move-ments are small (indium-thallium) and another (iron-nickel, 70%-30%) in which they arelarge. In this way, a better understanding of the various phenomena involved in martensitictransformations can be obtained. An overview of martensitic transformations and theirmicrostructure can be found in two comprehensive review articles by Wayman.

17.9 THE BAIN DISTORTION
A face-centered cubic lattice can also be considered as a body-centered tetragonal lattice. See Fig. 17.22 in which (in the upper diagram) a tetragonal unit cell is delineated in the face-centered cubic structure. In a tetragonal structure, the crystallographic axes lie at right anglesto each other, as in a cubic structure, but one lattice constant cdiffers in magnitude from the17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 538

other two. These latter dimensions of the unit cell are usually designated by the symbol a.
When considered as a body-centered tetragonal structure, the normal face-centered struc-
ture has a c/aratio of . Similarly, a body-centered cubic structure can be considered a
body-centered tetragonal structure with a c/aratio of unity. In 1924, Bain20suggested that a
body-centered cubic lattice could be obtained from a face-centered cubic structure by a com-
pression parallel to the caxis and an expansion along the two aaxes. Any simple homoge-
neous pure distortion of this nature, which converts one lattice into another by an expansion
or contraction along the crystallographic axes, belongs to a class known as Bain distortions .
The Bain distortion indicated above converts a face-centered cubic lattice into a body-
centered lattice with a minimum of atomic movements. However, there is no undistorted
plane associated with this Bain distortion (as we shall presently see), so that the invariant
plane strain associated with martensitic transformations cannot be explained by a Bain
distortion. The Bain distortion does, however, give an approximate measure of the mag-
nitude of atomic movements involved in a transformation. Thus, in the iron-nickel alloy
(30 percent Ni) of Table 17.1, which undergoes a face-centered cubic to body-centered
cubic transformation, the caxis is shortened by a factor of approximately 0.8, while the a/H112291.417Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 539

martensite transformations given in Table 17.1; 0.20 and 0.024, respectively.
17.10 THE MARTENSITE TRANSFORMATION 
IN AN INDIUM-THALLIUM ALLOY
We shall now consider in some detail the martensite transformation in the indium-thallium
alloy, where the small size of the observed shear makes for easier understanding of the
observed phenomena. Studies made of single crystals of this alloy are of special interest.
Provided that the crystals are carefully annealed and not bent or damaged, they undergo
martensitic transformations involving the motion of a single interface between the cubic
(parent phase) and the tetragonal (product phase).21,22This transformation does not occur
by the formation of lens-shaped plates, or even parallel-sided plates, but by the motion of a
single planar boundary that crosses from one side of the crystal to the other. On cooling, an
interface ﬁrst appears at one end of a specimen and, with continued cooling, moves down
through the entire length of the crystal. Because of dimensional changes accompanying the
reaction, its progress can be followed23with the aid of a simple dilatometer that permits
measurements of the specimen length to be made as a function of temperature. A typical set
of data is shown in Fig. 17.24. Notice that on cooling, the length of the specimen begins to17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 540

change at approximately 345 K, signifying that the martensite transformation started at this
temperature. It is customary in all martensite transformations to designate, by the symbol Ms,
the temperature corresponding to the start of the transformation. The curve also shows thatthe specimen did not transform completely until the temperature was lowered to about 340 K. This latter temperature is designated as the M
f, or martensite ﬁnish temperature. In
order to move the interface from one end of the specimen to the other, it was necessary todrop the temperature 5 K below the M
stemperature. During this temperature interval
between Msand Mf, the interface, or habit plane does not move steadily and smoothly, but
rather in a jerky fashion. It moves very rapidly for a short distance in a direction normal toitself and then stops until a further decrease in temperature gives it enough driving force tomove forward again. The irregular motion of the interface is not apparent in the dilatome-ter measurements of Fig. 17.24, but may be readily observed by watching the movement ofthe interface under a microscope. The necessity for an ever-increasing driving force to con-tinue the reaction is an unusual phenomenon because it implies the existence of a volumerelaxation,
24or an energy term opposing the transformation which is proportional to the
volume of metal transformed. An explanation for the effect can be given in terms of theintersection of the interface with obstacles. It is now believed that martensitic and deforma-tion twin interfaces can be composed of dislocation arrays. It is also recognized that a movingscrew dislocation, which cuts through another screw dislocation, acquires a jog or discontinu-ity that produces a row of vacancies or interstitials as the moving dislocation continues itsadvance. While the geometry of the dislocation arrays in the crystals and in the interfaces isnot known, the screw-dislocation-intersection picture gives us a tentative picture
25of how a
moving interface can develop a resistance to its motion proportional to the distance throughwhich it moves. The screw components in an interface should cut other screw dislocations ina number proportional to the distance through which the interface moves: each intersectionadding its own contribution to the total force holding back the boundary.
17.11 REVERSIBILITY OF THE MARTENSITE 
TRANSFORMATION
The indium-thallium transformation is reversible for, on reheating, the specimen revertsnot only to the cubic phase, but also to its original single-crystal orientation. If recooled,the original interface reappears and the cycle can be completely reproduced (provided thespecimen is not heated to too high a temperature or held for too long a time betweencycles).
The reverse transformation is shown in Fig. 17.24 by the return of the specimen to its
original dimensions. It does not, however, retransform in the same temperature intervalas that in which the forward transformation occurred, but in one averaging about 2 Khigher. A hysteresis in the temperature dependence of the transformation is characteristicof most martensite transformations.
17.12 ATHERMAL TRANSFORMATION
In the single-crystal experiments discussed in the preceding paragraph, we have seen thatthe martensite transformation in indium-thallium occurs as a result of temperature changesthat increase the driving force for the reaction (free energy). The progress of transformationis, accordingly, not time dependent. In theory, the faster one cools the specimen, the fasterthe interface moves, with equal amounts of transformation resulting at equal temperatures.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 541

Time does, however, have a secondary, though negative, effect on this transformation, for
isothermal holding of the specimen at any temperature between the start and end of the
transformation tends to stabilize the interface against further movement. This effect is
demonstrated in Fig. 17.25, where the indicated transformation curve corresponds to a
specimen whose heating cycle was interrupted at 345 K and held at this temperature 6 hr.
Not only did the holding of the specimen at this temperature not induce additional trans-
formation, but it also stabilized the interface. In order to make the interface move again, it
was necessary to increase the driving force by approximately 1 K. An equivalent phenom-
enon occurs on cooling, so that it can be concluded that the formation of martensite in the
present alloy depends primarily on temperature. A transformation of this type is said to be
athermal, in contrast to one that will occur at constant temperature (isothermal transfor-
mation). Although isothermal formation of martensite is observed in some alloys, marten-
sitic transformations tend to be predominantly athermal.
17.13 PHENOMENOLOGICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC THEORY 
OF MARTENSITE FORMATION
The nature of the atomic mechanisms that convert one crystal structure into the other
in the narrow conﬁnes that we deﬁne as the interface are not known. Wechsler,
Lieberman, and Read26have shown, nevertheless, that the crystallographic features of
martensite transformations can be completely explained in terms of the following three
basic deformations:
1. A Bain distortion , which forms the product lattice from the parent lattice, but
which, in general, does not yield an undistorted plane that can be associated with
the habit plane of the deformation.
2. A shear deformation , which maintains the lattice symmetry (does not change the
crystal structure) and, in combination with the Bain distortion, produces an undis-
torted plane. In most cases, this undistorted plane possesses a different orientation
in space in the parent and product lattices.
3. A rotation of the transformed lattice , so that the undistorted plane has the same
orientation in space in both the parent and product crystals.
No attempt is made in this theory to give physical signiﬁcance to the order of the
steps listed here, and the entire theory is best viewed as an analytical explanation of how
one lattice can be formed from the other. As such, the Wechsler-Lieberman-Read theory17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 542

FIG. 17.26 In the cubic to tetragonal transformation, the Bain
distortion does not possess an undistorted planeis a phenomenological crystallographic theory of the martensite transformation. This
approach to explaining martensitic transformation in metals has been successful in most
instances.18,19In those cases where the theory appears to work best the martensite plates
have a typically lenticular shape. It should be noted that the lens shape is generally asso-
ciated with a minimum strain energy and is similar to that observed in deformation twin-
ning. However, martensite has also been observed to take several other more intricate
shapes. Among the other morphologies are the segmented plates observed in the alloy 
Fe-8Cr-1C, where “sideplates” are frequently seen to extend out from the principal inter-
face of the martensite plates. In another case, the martensite lenses appear to have a
midrib, which is believed to be a region where there is an increased concentration of
transformation twins. Still another variant from the typical lenticular morphology is
observed in Fe-Ni-C alloys. In this case the martensite plates are parallel sided and not
lens shaped. This is known as thin plate martensite. Martensite can also be nucleated at
the surface and not penetrate deeply into the specimen in some martensitic materials,
giving rise to the term surface martensite. Alloys of Fe-Ni-C can also exhibit a morphol-
ogy that has been described as butterﬂy martensite.
The indium-thallium transformation will now be considered in terms of the Wechsler,
Lieberman, and Read theory. The Bain distortion for the indium-thallium transformation
is shown in Fig. 17.23, where the very small actual deformation is magniﬁed in order to
show the effect more clearly. The original structure is cubic, while the ﬁnal is tetragonal,
so that the Bain distortion consists of an extension (2 /H9255) along one axis (the caxis) and a
contraction ( /H11002/H9255) along the other two axes. Simple geometrical reasoning will show that
the given distortion does not possess an invariant plane. Consider ﬁrst the set of lines
drawn on the front face of the cube in Fig. 17.26. Lines aband cdrepresent those direc-
tions on this surface, the lengths of which do not change in the transformation. In the cube
shown on the left and in the prism shown on the right, these lengths are the same. All
other directions on this surface, such as efand gh, have their lengths increased and short-
ened respectively by the distortion. Now assume that the distortion actually possesses an
invariant plane that passes through the front surfaces of each of the two geometrical
ﬁgures. To be an invariant plane, it must contain one of the two lines whose lengths do
not change. For our purpose, assume that this line is aband that the trace of the plane on
the right side of each geometrical ﬁgure is bm, where bmis a direction on these latter faces
whose length is also not changed by the deformation. The plane deﬁned by abmpossesses17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 543

FIG. 17.27 The Bain cone in the cubic and tetragonal structures corresponding
to the indium-thallium transformation. The distortion shown is exaggerated in
order to emphasize its naturethe characteristic that before and after the distortion the two distances aband bmare
unchanged. However, the angle /H9251between these two directions is obviously changed by the
distortion. Plane abmcannot be an undistorted plane, for not only must the magnitudes of
vectors be maintained, but also the angles between the vectors must be unchanged. If we
now take into account the symmetry of the Bain distortion, it becomes quite evident that
there is no undistorted plane associated with it.
The directions that are undistorted in the above Bain distortion form a cone whose
positions in the cubic and tetragonal structures are indicated in Fig. 17.27. Notice that the
vertex angle of the cone decreases during the Bain distortion as the cube is drawn into
the right prism. In each of the two sketches of Fig. 17.27, a plane is drawn intersecting
the Bain cone in two lines designated as opand oq. The lengths of these lines are
unchanged by the distortion since they lie on the Bain cone. Their angular separation,
however, changes. The given plane is drawn to represent the habit, or interface, plane of
the transformation in its positions before and after the Bain distortion, and lies very close17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 544

We shall now turn our attention speciﬁcally to the tetragonal structure that is indi-
cated again in Fig. 17.28, where the position of the (101) plane which also passes through
line qois shown. Let us also consider that this is the ﬁrst undistorted plane ( K1) of a shear
(in the same sense as in twinning). A second plane, which lies at almost 90° to K1, is also
given in the diagram. This plane belongs to the same zone as (101) and ( 01) and lies very
close to the latter plane. This second plane contains line poand is the second undistorted
plane ( K2) of the desired shear. The shearing action is indicated in Fig. 17.29. As a result
of this operation, point pis translated to p/H11032, with no change in the length of opas it rotates

inal cubic structure, and the plane deﬁned by p/H11032oqis now an undistorted plane. This fol-
lows from the fact that the vectors poand qoare unchanged in length and angular relation117Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 545

(noncollinear) vectors in plane are undistorted (unchanged in length) and the angle
between them is unchanged by a transformation, all vectors in that plane are undistorted
(and all angles are unchanged), that is, the plane is one of zero distortion.” Actually, line
p/H11032odoes not lie strictly in plane poq, so that this line and line oqdeﬁne a new plane, which
is the true habit plane. In other words, plane poqis not the habit plane. However, the angle
between plane p/H11032oqand poqis so small that we shall consider p/H11032oto lie in poqand that
this latter is the true habit plane. The position of line p/H11032ois, accordingly, plotted in the
lower diagram of Fig. 17.27. The plane containing both p/H11032oqand poqof this ﬁgure can now
be taken as representing the approximate position of the undistorted plane after both the
Bain distortion and the shear have occurred. A careful comparison of this sketch with the
one above it shows that the undistorted plane in the cubic structure and in the tetragonal
structure have different orientations in space. For this reason, p/H11032oqdoes not yet satisfy the
requirements of a habit plane. It must not only be undistorted by the transformation, but
it must also be unrotated. A rotation of the tetragonal structure must now be added, which
brings plane p/H11032oqinto coincidence with plane poqin such a manner that lines op/H11032and oq
of the tetragonal phase fall on lines opand oqof the cubic phase, respectively. No effort will
be made to demonstrate this rotation with diagrams, for the primary purpose of this dis-
cussion has only been to demonstrate the need for considering the three basic steps (Bain
distortion, shear, and rotation).
There remains the problem of explaining the nature of the arbitrary shearing process
that is needed during the second step of the deformation. In martensitic deformation, the
required shear can occur in one of two basic ways: either as a result of slip or as a result
of mechanical twinning. Assuming that the deformation is conﬁned to the product lattice,
Fig. 17.30 shows how this may accomplished by slip. Glide occurs more homogeneously
distributed over a group of slip planes parallel K1. In the case of mechanical twinning, what
usually happens is that the shear (strain) required to produce the habit plane of the defor-
mation does not equal the shear (strain) that occurs when the product lattice undergoes
mechanical twinning. In the present example, mechanical twinning, not slip, furnishes the
shear. The twinning occurs in the tetragonal lattice of indium-thallium on {110} planes
and with a shear of about 0.06. Notice that the indicated K1(101) is a twinning plane. The
shear needed on this same plane in order to make angle p/H11032oqequal to poqis one-third of
the twinning shear. Clearly, if the entire lattice is twinned after suffering a Bain distortion,
it will not be possible to produce the desired undistorted habit plane. This difﬁculty is17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 546

bands parallel to the twinning plane. Thus, the desired macroscopic shear will be obtained
if the net width of the twinned areas is one-third that of the untwinned. This is shown in
Fig. 17.31, and the resulting transformed structure is shown in Fig. 17.32. It is very impor-
tant to note the difference between the two shears involved in the above discussion. In
one case, we have considered the shear parallel to the tetragonal twinning planes. The
sense of this shear is shown on the right face of the specimen shown in Fig. 17.32. The
other shear is the macroscopic shear of the total transformation. This is the net deforma-
tion that we observe when we take the resultant of the three distortions (Bain, shear, and
rotation) and represents motion parallel to the habit or interface plane. The latter (plus a
distortion normal to the habit plane) is what one observes when one considers the speci-
men as a whole. As a result of the macroscopic shear, the specimen as a whole is tilted at
the habit plane. This is demonstrated in the sketch of Fig. 17.32, which also shows the
sense of this shear with the aid of vectors located on the front face of the specimen. The
shear associated with twinning is on a very much ﬁner scale than the macroscopic shear
and is visible on the surface in the tetragonal structure only where it appears as a series of
ﬁne parallel surface tilts. Figure 17.33 shows an actual photograph of an indium-thallium
alloy illustrating the ﬁne twinned structure in the tetragonal phase. Finally, it should be
noted that the twinning that occurs in the tetragonal region is on an extremely ﬁne scale.
This is necessary in order to minimize the distortion at the habit plane. A little though17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 547

shows that the habit plane on a microscopic scale is not a plane of zero distortion, for
where each one of the tetragonal bands intersects the interface (Fig. 17.32), the lattice isdistorted as the tetragonal structure tries to match the cubic lattice on the other side of theboundary. The habit plane is actually a plane of zero distortion only on a macroscopicscale. The distortion at the interface corresponding to any one of the tetragonal bands iscompensated by that of the neighboring bands, which are in a twinned relationship to theﬁrst band and distort the interface in the opposite sense. We may thus conclude that theﬁner the tetragonal twinned bands, the less intense the distortion in the interface.
17.14 IRRATIONAL NATURE OF THE HABIT PLANE
One of the nice features of the Wechsler, Lieberman, and Read26theory is that it shows
quite clearly why the habit plane in martensitic transformations is usually irrational. Thischaracteristic is in sharp contrast to the twinning plane in deformation twinning, which isalmost invariably a plane of low rational indices. Let us now reconsider line oqin 
Fig. 17.28. This line is actually deﬁned as the intersection of the ﬁrst undistorted ( K
1) plane
of the shear (twinning plane) and the Bain cone. In the ﬁgure it is a rational [ 1] direc-tion. However, line opis not a rational direction, but diverges slightly from the [1 1] 
direction. It would coincide with [1 1] if the shear were exactly equal to the simple twin-ning shear on the {101} plane, because then the second undistorted plane K

have seen, and the K2plane, therefore, makes a small angle with ( 01). Since opis not a
rational direction, neither is op/H11032its position after shear. The ﬁnal result is that since the
habit plane is determined by op/H11032and oq,it is not a rational plane [that is, (011)]. The diver-
gence of the habit plane from a rational plane in the indium-thallium alloy is, however,
almost negligible, for it lies only 26 /H11032away from the (011) plane21and has the indices
(0.013, 0.993, 1). The ﬁgures illustrating the theory have, of course, been made consid-
erably out of scale for the speciﬁc purpose of making the distortions more readily appar-
ent. Distortions of the order used in the ﬁgure are, however, observed when larger atom
displacements occur in the transformations. The indices of the habit planes in these
alloys, accordingly, diverge widely from simple low-induce planes. Additional details on
the crystallography of habit planes can be found in References 28 and 29.
It is now necessary to say a word about the multiplicity of the orientations that can be
obtained in a martensitic transformation. The number of possible habit planes can be quite
large in most reactions. In the indium-thallium alloy there are 24 possible habit planes, all
of which lie very close to {110} planes (within 26 /H11032), which signiﬁes that there are four
habit plane orientations closely clustered about each of the six {110} planes.
17.15 THE IRON-NICKEL MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION
While the above discussion of the martensitic transformation in indium-thallium alloys
has been somewhat lengthy, it has touched on many of the important aspects of marten-
sitic transformations. The reversible characteristic of the transformation is duplicated in
most other alloys that undergo martensitic transformations. The athermal nature of the
transformation is also a typical martensitic property, and the same holds true for the sta-
bilization phenomenon, the irrational nature of the habit plane, and the complexity of the
deformation. There remains now, among other things, a consideration of the effect on the
transformation of an increase in the deformation associated with the transformation. For
this purpose, let us return to the previously mentioned iron-nickel alloy (70 percent Fe–30
percent Ni).30Figure 17.34 shows the temperature dependence of the transformation of
this alloy (athermal characteristics). In this particular case, the transformation was fol-
lowed by resistivity measurements. This is possible because the resistance of the body-
centered cubic product is lower than that of the face-centered cubic parent phase and the
resistance of a mixture of the phases is proportional to the amount of martensite formed.
The diagram shows a much larger hysteresis effect than is found in the indium-thallium1117Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 549
Chapter 17 Deformation Twinning and Martensite Reactions 550
FIG. 17.35 Martensite plates that formed in a burst in an
iron-nickel specimen. 500 /H11003. (Courtesy of John F. Breedis.)alloy. In indium-thallium the reverse transformation occurs only a few degrees above the
forward transformation. In the iron-nickel alloy, martensite begins to form at Ms/H11005243 K.
The reverse transformation commences at a temperature designated As(austenite start
temperature) which is 420 K higher than Ms. The 420 K temperature difference is indica-
tive of the large driving force needed in this alloy to nucleate the transformations.
The difﬁculty associated with the formation of martensite plates in the iron-nickel
alloy appears quite plainly in another respect: the size of the plates that form. These areextremely small and typically ellipsoidal, or lens-shaped. At temperatures slightly belowM
s, an interesting phenomenon occurs in these alloys: a large fraction (about 25 percent)
of the austenite transforms to martensite in a burst.31It occurs so rapidly that a shock wave
results which Machlin and Cohen report as capable of occasionally shattering the Dewarﬂask that contained the transforming specimen suspended by a thread in a refrigeratingliquid. This is excellent evidence of the large driving force for the reaction. The plates thatform in the burst (Fig. 17.35) are still small in size, but have a somewhat greater thicknessthan those formed prior to the burst.
The burst phenomenon can be looked upon as an autocatalytic effect. At an early state
in the transformation, a point is reached where the formation of a few more plates trig-gers the formation of a large number of additional plates.
The progress of the athermal transformation in this alloy is quite different from that in
the indium-thallium alloy. In the latter, the transformation was accomplished by the move-ment of a single interface through the length of the entire specimen and a decreasingtemperature was required in order to drive the interface. In the iron-nickel specimens,martensite plates, even in a single crystal of the parent phase, form and grow very rapidly17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 550

plates, which is accomplished by lowering the temperature and increasing the driving force.
The limited growth of the martensite plates in this alloy is undoubtedly associated
with the magnitudes of the strains connected with their growth. These latter are large
enough to cause plastic ﬂow to occur in the matrix surrounding the martensite plate, and
it has been proposed31that this deformation causes the plates to lose their coherency with
the parent lattice. On this basis, it is proposed that growth stops with the loss of coherency.
Finally, it should be mentioned that the orientation relationship between the martensite
and the parent austenite phase in Fe-Ni alloys depends on the alloy composition.32
17.16 ISOTHERMAL FORMATION OF MARTENSITE
Martensite has been observed to form isothermally,33as well as athermally, in 30 percent
iron-nickel specimens. In either case, reaction proceeds as the result of the nucleation of
additional plates, and not through the growth of existing plates. Curves showing the
amount of isothermal martensite formed as a function of time are given in Fig. 17.36.
These curves also serve another useful purpose because they demonstrate the interrelation
between the athermal and isothermal transformations. The intersection of each isothermal
curve with the ordinate axis gives the amount of martensite formed on the quench to the
holding temperature.
17.17 STABILIZATION
The phenomenon of stabilization is also observed in iron-nickel alloys. The mechanism dif-
fers from that observed in the indium-thallium alloy, but the effect is the same; isothermal
holding of the specimens at a temperature between Msand Mfstabilizes the transformation
so that additional supercooling is required in order to start the transformation again. In the
indium-thallium specimens, stabilization occurs as a result of a retardation of the movement
of the interface, whereas in the iron-nickel alloy, stabilization is manifested by an increased
difﬁculty in the nucleation of additional plates. In order for the reaction to continue, an addi-
tional increment of driving force is needed to nucleate more plates. Stabilization is also17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 551

observed during the reverse transformation when martensite is reacted to form austenite. In
this case, no observable isothermal reaction occurs, so that the stabilization effect appears
clearly in a resistivity-temperature curve. Such a curve is shown in Fig. 17.37.
17.18 NUCLEATION OF MARTENSITE PLATES
The nucleation of martensite plates is a subject of great interest and also of considerable
controversy. The available experimental evidence favors the belief that martensite nuclei
form heterogeneously, as in most other phase transformations. Theoretical calculations
also support the concept of the heterogeneous nucleation of martensite nuclei. In this
regard, a straightforward calculation34gave a value of about 8 /H1100310/H1100216J for the energy
required in a nucleation event. This is about 105times greater than the value of kTat tem-
peratures where martensite is known to nucleate. Consequently, it is so large that it is
unlikely that martensite could be nucleated homogeneously by heterophase ﬂuctuations.
The exact nature of the lattice defects, at which martensite nucleates heterogeneously,
is still an unsolved problem. Experimental information about these sites is still inadequate.
Over the years, a number of theoretical models for these sites have also been proposed but,
while they may adequately describe the martensitic behavior of a speciﬁc alloy, they lack
generality.
It has often been suggested that dislocations and grain boundaries may act as favor-
able nucleation sites. Kajiwara,35has described some interesting results that tend to clar-
ify the role of dislocations and grain boundaries in martensite nucleation. He used ten
different ferrous alloy compositions of the types Fe-Ni, Fe-NI-C, and Fe-Cr-C and con-
cluded that while dislocations themselves were not favorable sites for the nucleation of
martensite, their existence in the metal could aid in the accommodation of the shape
strain of the martensite. On the other hand, it was observed that if the dislocation den-
sity in the austenite is too high, the accommodation of the shape strain becomes difﬁcult
due to the higher level of work hardening so that martensite nucleation tends to be sup-
pressed. Certain grain boundaries were found to act as nucleation sites. However, the spe-
ciﬁc crystallographic nature of these boundaries was not determined. Finally, it was
concluded, quantitatively, in agreement with the qualitative observations of other inves-
tigators, that decreasing the grain size of the parent austenite lowers the Mstemperature.
This relationship between the austenite grain size and the martensite start temperature
can be rationalized simply in terms of the fact that decreasing the austenite grain size
makes it more difﬁcult to accommodate the shape change of a martensite plate in an
austenite grain. Therefore, a greater driving force, available at a lower temperature, is
required for nucleation.17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 552
553 17.20 The Effect of Stress
No simple theory of martensite nucleation is yet available.36This is probably due to
the fact that martensite can form under two extremely different sets of conditions. First, it
can form athermally, which means that it can form in a very small fraction of a second
provided the temperature is lowered sufﬁciently to activate those nuclei that will respond
in this manner. This type of nucleation apparently does not need thermal activation. The
ability of martensite to form without the aid of thermal energy is also demonstrated by the
fact that martensite plates can be nucleated in some alloys at temperatures as low as 4 K,
where the energy of thermal vibrations is vanishingly small. On the other hand, marten-
site is also capable of forming at constant temperature. The fact that in this case it has a
nucleation rate that is time dependent shows that thermal energy can also be a factor in
the nucleation of martensite.
17.19 GROWTH OF MARTENSITE PLATES
The growth of martensite plates does not have the twofold nature of nucleation, for here
it appears that thermal activation is not a factor. The evidence leading to this conclusion
includes the fact that plates grow to their ﬁnal sizes with great rapidity. Measurements
show that the growth velocity is of the order of one-third the velocity of sound in the
matrix. To this must be added the fact that the growth velocity is independent of temper-
ature. If the growth of martensite plates occurred as the result of atoms jumping over an
energy barrier from the parent phase to the product phase, then the jump rate should be
a decreasing function of the temperature, and at some ﬁnite temperature a noticeable
dropping off in the martensitic growth rate should become apparent. This does not occur.
Martensite has been observed to form with great rapidity even at 4 K.
17.20 THE EFFECT OF STRESS
Because the formation of martensite plates involves a change of shape in a ﬁnite volume
of matter, applied stress can inﬂuence the reaction. This is entirely analogous to the for-
mation of deformation twins by stress. However, because the formation of a martensite
plate involves both shear and normal components of strain, the dependence on stress is
more complicated than in the case of twinning. Nevertheless, theoretical predictions of the
effect of various stress patterns on the formation of martensite have been found to agree
quite well with experiment.37We shall not discuss this theory in detail, but it is important
to note that the Mstemperature can be either raised or lowered as a result of applied
stresses. This may be understood in terms of the following, perhaps oversimpliﬁed, picture.
Suppose, as shown in Fig. 17.38, the macroscopic strain associated with the formation of
a martensite plate is a pure shear (normal component zero). Then if the sense of an applied
shear stress is the same as the strain, the stress should aid the formation of the plate. A

lower driving force for the reaction is to be expected and Msshould be raised. Similarly, if
the shear-stress vector is reversed, the formation of the plate becomes more difﬁcult and
the temperature at which the plate forms should be lowered. It is important to note that,in respect to the latter, a simple applied shear stress may not necessarily lower M
sbecause
of the multiplicity of the habit planes on which martensite can form. While the indicatedplate might not be favorably oriented to the stress, it is quite probable that there are otherplate orientations in the crystal that are.
17.21 THE EFFECT OF PLASTIC DEFORMATION
Plastic deformation of the matrix also has an effect on the formation of martensite, which isprimarily to increase the sizes of internal strains and make the nucleation of martensite eas-ier. As a result, martensite can form when the metal is plastically deformed at temperatureswell above the M
stemperature. The amount of martensite thus formed decreases, however,
as the temperature is raised, and it is common practice to designate the highest temperatureat which martensite may be formed by deformation as the M
dtemperature. In reversible
martensitic transformations, plastic deformation usually has a similar effect on the reversetransformation. The temperature at which the reverse transformation starts is lowered byplastic deformation. The M
dand Ad(austenite start temperature for plastic deformation) are
shown plotted as vertical dashed lines in Fig. 17.34. Notice that plastic deformation bring thestart of the forward and reverse transformations much closer together—within approxi-mately 100 K. The corresponding difference between M
sand Asis 420 K.
17.22 THERMOELASTIC MARTENSITE TRANSFORMATIONS
The formation of a martensite plate normally involves a change in shape of a ﬁnite volumeof material. Because the martensite platelet is coherent with the parent crystal matrix, astate of strain is set up in the martensite particle and the matrix. The strain in the lattice ofthe parent is called an accommodation strain . This accommodation strain can be either elastic
or plastic or a combination of both. Whether or not the shape strain is accommodated inthe parent elastically or with a sizeable amount of plastic deformation is an important con-sideration. If the strain in the matrix is elastic, the boundaries between the martensite andthe parent phase are normally able to move both easily and reversibly. Thus, if martensiteis formed as a result of lowering the specimen temperature, and the accommodation strainin the parent phase is elastic, then on reheating the specimen, its martensite platelets sim-ply shrink back and disappear. Following this, if the specimen is cooled again so as to reformthe martensite, the same martensite platelets will normally reappear as on the ﬁrst quench.Furthermore, this cycle can often be repeated again and again.
On the other hand, if plastic deformation is induced in the matrix during a martensitic
transformation, then the boundaries between the martensite and the parent tend to becomelocked in place by the dislocation structure that results from the growth of the martensite. Inthis case, on reheating the specimen, the austenite is forced to nucleate inside the martensiticstructure. This means that it is normally difﬁcult to transform the martensite back to the par-ent phase so that a considerably higher temperature is required to start the reversed transfor-mation. In other words, in a metal where the accommodation strain is largely plastic thetemperature difference between M
sand Asis normally large. An example appears in Fig. 17.34,
which shows the martensitic transformation cycle of a Fe-29.5% Ni alloy where the shapechange is accommodated plastically. Note that the temperature difference between M
sand As
is 420 K. A typical metal where the accommodation strain is largely elastic is Au-50% Cd. 17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 554
555 17.22 Thermoelastic Martensite Transformations
Here, the formation of austenite on reheating does not require nucleation; it merely forms
as a result of the reversed motion of the martensite boundaries. Consequently, the differencein temperature between M
sand Asis very much smaller, being only about 16 K. The area
inside the Au-50% Cd hysteresis loop is also very much smaller than that in Fig. 17.34, signifying a much smaller energy loss during a complete cycle from austenite to martensiteto austenite.
Thermoelasticity during a structural phase transformation was originally predicted by
Kurdjumov in 1948. Some eleven years later, he suggested that during a thermoelastictransformation an equilibrium should exist between the chemical and non-chemical forceswhether a martensite plate grows or shrinks; the nature of this equilibrium depending onthe temperature and changing as the temperature is varied. An historical review of Kurdju-mov’s martensitic theory and laws can be found in an article by O. P. Maksimova.
38The
thermodynamics of the thermoelastic martensite transformation have been recently treatedby Ortin and Planes.
39Following their approach and notation, the equilibrium condition for
the forward transformation from the parent to the martensite phase may be written:
/H9004GP/H11002M/H11005/H11002 /H9004 GchP/H11002M/H11001/H9004GnchP/H11002M/H110050 17.5
where /H9004GP/H11002Mis the Gibbs free energy per mole of the moving plates, /H9004GchP/H11002Mis the chem-
ical component of the Gibbs free energy, and /H9004GnchP/H11002Mis the nonchemical component. The
nonchemical part of the free energy can consist of a number of parts; the most importantare the elastic energy /H9004G
elP/H11002Mand the work done against frictional forces, which is desig-
nated EfrP/H11002M. Thus, we have
/H9004GnchP/H11002M/H11005/H9004GelP/H11002M/H11001EfrP/H11002M17.6
Both the elastic and the frictional terms in Eq. 17.6 are composed of several parts. The elas-tic part of the free energy is primarily due to the energy stored in the interfaces between themartensite and the parent and to the elastic strains due to the creation of the martensite. Inturn, the frictional losses include the work done in moving the martensite interfaces, theenergy losses associated with the creation of internal defects induced by the transformation(such as stacking faults and twin boundaries), and the partial plastic accommodation arisingfrom volume and shape changes associated with the transformation. In general, with respectto thermoelastic transformation, the most important of these frictional losses are those dueto the motion of the interfaces. These frictional losses result in a thermal hysteresis loss.However, this hysteresis loss is much smaller than that of the non-thermoelastic transforma-tion exempliﬁed by the Fe-29.5% Ni alloy whose curve is shown in Fig. 17.34.
In light of the above, we may now write the thermodynamic equilibrium equation for
the forward direction of the transformation in the form:
/H11002/H9004GchP/H11002M/H11001/H9004GelP/H11002M/H11001EfrP/H11002M/H110050 17.7
It is important to note that Eq. 17.7 is concerned only with the local equilibrium or ther-
modynamic balance at a single-parent martensite boundary lying in a specimen that is onlypartially transformed at a speciﬁed temperature. In this equation, the ﬁrst term is assumed tobe a constant throughout a chemically homogeneous material. However, the latter two termsare not. As a result, thermodynamic equilibrium is not reached at the same time throughoutthe specimen and the specimen does not transform homogeneously. Also at the local level,one can assume that locally, there is a counterbalance at every temperature between thechemical free energy driving the transformation on the one hand, and the stored elastic strain17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 555
Chapter 17 Deformation Twinning and Martensite Reactions 556
energy and the irreversible frictional work that has been done, on the other . This simply means
that during cooling, when a given temperature is reached, the boundary of a plate moves
ahead through a distance such that just enough chemical energy is released to balance theelastic energy that is created plus the energy that is lost to friction by the movement.
Since Eq. 17.7 applies to all the interfaces that are moving at a given temperature, it is
possible to write a similar equation for a specimen that is undergoing a transformation at thistemperature by integrating the contributions from all of the moving interfaces in the speci-men. During the reverse transformation that occurs on heating, where the martensite isreverted to the parent phase, the stored elastic energy is recovered and aids the reverse trans-formation. It will now be assumed that the temperature during a reversed transformation isabove T
0, the equilibrium temperature between the product and the martensite where there
is no difﬁculty in either nucleating the martensite plates or causing them to grow. This, ofcourse, is the ideal condition and at T
0, the martensite transformation should be ideally
reversible and without any hystersis during a complete transformation cycle. The equilib-rium condition for the reversed transformation assuming that T/H11022T
0may now be written:
/H11002/H9004GchM/H11002P/H11002/H9004GelM/H11002P/H11001EfrM/H11002P/H110050 17.8
Note that in Eq. 17.8 both the chemical and elastic free energies are negative while
the frictional loss is positive. This means that in the reversed transformation both thechemical and elastic forces act to overcome the frictional forces.
17.23 ELASTIC DEFORMATION OF THERMOELASTIC ALLOYS
Thermoelastic martensitic transformations have been observed in a number of nonferrousalloys. Among these are Cu-Zn, Ag-Cd, Au-Cd, Cu-Zn-Al, and Cu-Al-Ni. Normally thealloys of Au, Ag, and Cu that show this behavior have compositions that place them in thebeta phase. However, a thermoelastic martensitic transformation has also been observedin a ferrous alloy, of iron with platinum, with a composition near Fe
3Pt. These alloys tend
to exhibit interesting behaviors when subjected to stress, and they can often be deformedelastically through relatively large strains. This has been observed both in the martensiticphase and in the austenitic phase above the martensite start temperature, M
s.
17.24 STRESS-INDUCED MARTENSITE (SIM)
If a stress is applied to a thermoelastic alloy at a temperature above its thermal Mstemper-
ature, in most cases the alloy is able to transform to martensite. This mechanically inducedmartensite reverses back to the austenitic phase upon removing the stress. Figure 17.39,from Schroeder and Wayman, shows a typical stress-strain curve obtained with a Cu-39.8%Zn specimen that was loaded and then unloaded at /H1100277°C (196 K). At 196 K this alloy is
well above its thermal M
s, which lies approximately at 149 K. Note that while the strain in 
Fig. 17.39 was essentially completely recovered so that the deformation cycle was elastic,the stress and the strain were not linearly related. This type of behavior is known as pseu-
doelasticity . A signiﬁcant feature of the data in Fig. 17.39 is the large magnitude of the elas-
tic strain that was observed: approximately 9 percent. The role that temperature can playin the stress-induced martensite transformation is shown in Fig. 17.40. In this diagram thestresses at which M
sand Aswere observed are plotted against the temperature at which the
specimens were put through a loading and unloading cycle. Note that the stresses required17Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 556

the greater the stress required to start either the transformation to martensite or the rever-
sion of the stress-induced martensite (SIM) to parent phase.
17.25 THE SHAPE-MEMORY EFFECT
If an alloy that is ordered in both the parent and martensitic phases and capable of undergo-
ing a thermoelastic martensitic transformation is deformed in a tensile test below Ms, one nor-
mally obtains a stress-strain curve like that shown schematically in Fig. 17.41. Note that unlike
the SIM stress-strain curve in Fig. 17.39, where the specimen was deformed above Ms, the
strain is not recovered on unloading. However, heating the specimen into the austenite region
allows this strain to be recovered and the specimen to regain its original shape. This is known
as the shape-memory effect . The ability of the martensite to undergo strains of the order of 6 to
8 percent is now reasonably understood. It is largely due to the 24-fold multiplicity of the

possible for a single austenite grain to be transformed into a region containing 24 martensite
orientations. In general, one of these martensite variants will have a shape deformation that
is the most favorable for the deformation of the specimen; that is, the one that makes the max-
imum contribution to the tensile deformation of the specimen. This orientation allows the
stress to do the maximum amount of work. As the specimen is deformed, the remaining 
23 variants will be converted into this preferred orientation. This conversion can occur either
by movements of the interfaces between the martensite variants or as result of twinning that
rotates the structure of a given variant into that of the variant best aligned for the deforma-
tion. Thus, in effect, the deformation converts the multivariant martensite structure into the
equivalent of a single crystal. On heating, the single-crystal deformed martensitic structure
transforms into a single crystal of the parent. This “unshearing” of the martensite during the
reversion to the parent phase restores the specimen to its original shape. An outline of 
the shape-memory process, due to Wayman, is shown in Fig. 17.42. Shape-memory alloys are
used in a variety of applications, from automotive to aerospace and medical devices.40,4117Ch17.qxd  11/6/08  3:57 PM  Page 558

FIG. 18.1 The iron-carbon phase diagram. (From Chipman, J.,
Met. Trans ., 355 [1972] with kind permission from Springer
Science and Business Media.)18.1 THE IRON-CARBON DIAGRAM
We shall now consider alloys of iron and carbon in some detail. There are several reasons
for this: ﬁrst, carbon steels constitute by far the greatest tonnage of metal used by man;
second, no other alloy system has been studied in such detail; and third, the solid-state
phase changes in steel are varied and interesting. Further, it is becoming increasingly evi-
dent that the solid-state reactions of the iron-carbon system are similar in many respects
to those that occur in other alloy systems. A study of the iron-carbon system is valuable
not only because it helps explain the properties of steels but also because it provides a
means of understanding solid-state reactions in general.
The iron-carbon diagram shown in Fig. 18.1 is not a complete diagram in that it is plot-
ted only for concentrations (in weight percent) of less than 12 percent carbon. It does,

however, cover that part of the diagram of primary interest in the study of steels and cast
irons. It is due to Chipman1and is currently accepted, with minor changes, as the standard
iron-carbon diagram.2This version of the diagram is complicated because it shows the equi-
librium relationships not only between iron and carbon (graphite) but also between ironand two iron-carbides; cementite (Fe
3C) and the Hägg carbide (Fe2.2C). Included in this dia-
gram are three nearly horizontal lines in the upper left-hand part of the diagram. Theselines represent the boundaries between the liquid and gaseous phases at three pressures;1.0, 0.1, and 0.01 atmospheres. They thus indicate the dependence of the boiling point tem-perature on composition at each of the indicated pressures. The two carbides aremetastable. In other words, carbon or graphite is more stable than the carbides. However,the decomposition of the carbides does not occur easily and, from a practical point of view,one may consider that, in plain carbon steels, the breakdown of the carbides to form ironand graphite does not occur. Furthermore, when a steel is slowly cooled from the liquid tothe solid state, cementite is normally the easiest to nucleate so that when carbon is precip-itated from solid solutions of alpha (body-centered cubic) or gamma (face-centered cubic),the resulting precipitate is almost always cementite, if the temperature is above 350°C. Itshould be noted that once cementite has formed, it is very stable. As shown on the phasediagram, the Hägg carbide is actually the more stable carbide below about 350°C. This con-stituent, however, has been identiﬁed in puriﬁed iron specimens carburized below 350°C.Hägg carbides have been observed to transform to cementite when steels containing themwere heated above 500°C. It is still not clear whether cementite transforms to the Hägg car-bide in a reasonable period of time on cooling. In any event, it will be assumed that in thestudy of steels one may reasonably use the simpliﬁed phase diagram shown in Fig. 18.2.
The phase diagram in Fig. 18.2 is also not a complete diagram in that it is only plotted
for concentrations (in weight percent) less than 6.67 percent carbon, the compositionof Fe
3C, or cementite. Cementite is an intermetallic compound with negligible solubility
limits, and the iron-carbon diagram can be divided at its composition into two independentparts. That part of the diagram containing carbon concentrations higher than 6.67 percenthas little commercial signiﬁcance and is usually ignored. The iron-carbon diagram in Fig. 18.2is characterized by three invariant points: a peritectic point at 0.17 percent C and 1495°C,
an eutectic point at 4.32 percent C and 1154°C, and an eutectoid point at 0.77 percent Cand 727°C. The peritectic transformation occurs at very high temperatures and in steels ofvery low-carbon concentration (the upper left-hand corner of the phase diagram).
The peritectic transformation has only secondary effects on the structures of steels at
room temperature. All compositions that, as they freeze, pass through the peritectic trans-formation region, enter the single-phase face-centered cubic ﬁeld. Except for coring effects(segregation) caused by the complexities of the peritectic transformation, these alloys areequivalent to higher carbon compositions (above 0.53 percent C) that freeze directly to thegamma or face-centered cubic phase. With the assumption that sufﬁcient time is allowedas the alloys cool to permit diffusion to bring about a homogeneous solid solution, we maydisregard the peritectic transformation in considerations of phase transformations thatoccur at lower temperatures.
The face-centered cubic solid solution, or gamma phase, is given the identifying name
austenite . A study of the phase diagram shows that all compositions containing less than 2.11
percent C pass through the austenite region on cooling from the liquid state to room tem-perature. Alloys in this interval are arbitrarily classed as steels. Actually, most carbon steelscontain less than 1 percent carbon, with the greatest tonnages produced in the range 0.2 to0.3 percent C (structural steels used in buildings, bridges, ships, etc.). Only in very rare18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 563

instances is steel used with more than 1 percent C (razor blades, cutlery, etc.) and then the
composition never rises more than a few tenths of one percent above one percent.
Compositions above 2 percent are classiﬁed as cast irons. However, it is necessary to notice
that cast irons of commerce are not simple alloys of iron and carbon, for they contain rela-
tively large quantities of other elements, the most prevalent of which is silicon. In general,
cast irons are better considered as ternary alloys of iron, carbon, and silicon. They also differ
in another important respect from steels. The presence of silicon promotes the formation of
graphite in them. As a result, cast irons may contain carbon in the form of both graphite and
cementite. The latter are called white cast irons, whereas the former are called gray cast irons
when graphite is in the form of ﬂakes. This fact signiﬁes an important difference between
cast irons and steels, for the latter contain only combined carbon in the form Fe3C.
While the phase transformations associated with the eutectic point at 4.32 percent C
are interesting and useful in a detailed study of the structures in cast irons, time does not
permit us to consider this section of the phase diagram.00100200300400500600700Temperature °C0.22%911.5%

565 18.2 The Proeutectoid Transformations of Austenite
A detailed analysis of the phase transformations at the peritectic and eutectic
points of the iron-carbon system are not essential in a study of steels. We shall focus
our attention, therefore, on the phase transformations that occur in the eutectoidregion of the phase diagram. This study is not simple, because we have to considernot only equilibrium phase transformations, but also those that occur under non-equilibrium conditions. With the assumption of slow-cooling, the phase changes insteels can be predicted with considerable accuracy using the equilibrium diagram. Onthe other hand, when the transformations do not occur under equilibrium conditons,such as when the metal is cooled rapidly, new and different metastable phases andconstituents form. Since these structures are important to the theory of the harden-ing of steels, the kinetics and principles of their formation are of considerable impor-tance. These will be considered later. For the present, the reactions that occur asaustenite is slowly cooled
3will be discussed.
18.2 THE PROEUTECTOID TRANSFORMATIONS OF AUSTENITE
The microstructures obtained when a steel is slowly cooled from the austenitic regiondepend on the original carbon concentration of the steel. If this concentration is less than0.77 percent, the eutectoid composition, then the microstructure will contain two pri-mary constituents: proeutectoid ferrite and pearlite. If the carbon concentration equalsthat of the eutectoid, the structure will consist only of pearlite, and if it is higher than0.77 percent, it will contain proeutectoid cementite and pearlite. Both the proeutectoidferrite and the proeutectoid cementite nucleate preferentially and heterogeneously onthe austenite grain boundaries. There are two basic reasons for this: the boundaries con-tain energetically favorable sites for nucleation and they are regions where the diffusionrates are higher. When a ferrite nucleus forms at an austenitic grain boundary, it normallydevelops a different orientation relationship with respect to the austenite grains on thetwo sides of the boundary. Generally, the nucleus will have a simple orientation relation-ship with one of its two neighboring austenite grains known as the Kurdjumov-Sachs
relationship (K-J). This is:
{111}/H9253/H20841/H20841{110}/H9251(habit plane)
18.1
/H20855110 /H20856/H9253/H20841/H20841 /H20855111 /H20856/H9251
In this relationship, a {110} plane of the alpha phase is aligned with a {111} plane ofthe austenite. The boundary between the nucleus and this austenite grain conforms tothe Kurdjumov-Sachs relation and is the habit plane. In this habit plane, a /H20855111/H20856direc-
tion in the ferrite nucleus is aligned with a /H20855110/H20856direction in the austenite. Since this
habit plane is a low-energy boundary it normally does not move during the growth ofthe nucleus. The ferrite grain, thus, grows into only one of the two austenite grainsassociated with the boundary. In this regard, the boundary that is created between theferrite nucleus and the austenite grain into which it grows is, in general, a high-energyor noncoherent boundary. However, it has been often observed that when a new phasegrows inward from a boundary, this phase may appear as long thin plates (or needles).This produces a morphology usually called a Widmannstätten plate structure . Such a struc-
ture is commonly observed when austenite transforms into ferrite. It is most readilyseen in steel specimens in which the austenite grain size was very large before thetransformation took place.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 565
Chapter 18 The Iron-Carbon Alloy System 566
It has been observed that the Widmannstätten plates or laths can both increase in
length and thickness as the transformation proceeds. There are two different types of
boundaries that actually separate a ferrite lath from the austenite grain into which the lath
grows: (1) the parallel sides of the lath, and (2) the edge or end of the lath. The sides of
the lath are normally assumed to be low-energy or coherent (or at least semicoherent)
boundaries and thus immobile. The boundary at the end of the lath, on the other hand, is
expected to be a non-coherent high-energy boundary in agreement with its observed
mobility. On this basis, one would normally expect that a lath should only grow in length
but not in thickness. However, a solution to the thickening problem of the laths has been
proposed by Aaronson.4This proposal, which is supported by experimental observations,
assumes that the laths thicken as a result of the lateral movement of small ledges or steps
along the coherent faces of the laths. A schematic drawing illustrating this type of growth
is given in Fig. 18.3. Part A of this ﬁgure shows the serrated interfacial structure of a fer-
rite grain growing in this manner, while Part B shows the elimination of the serrations as
a result of extensive further growth.
In the hypereutectoid steels with greater than 0.77 percent carbon, the proeutectoid
cementite also nucleates at the austenite grain boundaries. In this case, the cementite tends
to form as a layer that lies only on one side of a boundary and in some cases, under the
right conditions, it may actually form a continuous grain boundary network. Thus, it nor-
mally grows only into one of the two grains at the boundary. An orientation relationship
also exists between the cementite and the austenite grain into which the cementite does
not grow. Since cementite is tetragonal, this relationship is complicated and may be found
in the literature.5
18.3 THE TRANSFORMATION OF AUSTENITE TO PEARLITE
When the carbon concentration of an iron-carbon alloy is 0.77, it transforms on slow cool-
ing to the eutectoid structure, pearlite . For a more detailed historical review of the mecha-
nism and crystallography of pearlite, consult the article by Paul R. Howell.6In practice,
steels are almost always cooled so that the temperature falls continuously. Thus, annealed
steels are slowly cooled by leaving them in a furnace after the power to the furnace has
been shut off, or a normalized steel is cooled by removing the red hot metal from the
furnace and allowing it to cool in air. In continuous cooling processes, the nature of the
reaction changes with the decreasing temperature. This change is particularly marked
when the rate of cooling is appreciable. It goes almost without saying that the resultingLow-energy

FIG. 18.5 The eutectoid section of the iron-carbon diagrammicrostructures are very difﬁcult to analyze. Much more readily interpretable specimens
are obtained when austenite is allowed to transform at constant temperature. True isother-
mal transformation is possible because of the relatively small heat of transformation
involved; normally of the order of 4.2 J per mol, which is about one-fourth of the latent
heat of fusion ( LFfor pure iron /H1100515.5 J per mol). In addition, the use of small specimens
and the relatively slow reaction rates observed when austenite decomposes allow transfor-
mation heat to be removed fast enough to prevent appreciable temperature rises.
Figure 18.4 illustrates a simple experimental method of studying isothermal austenitic
transformations. As may be seen by examining Fig. 18.5 (an enlarged section of the iron-
carbon diagram containing the eutectoid point), a steel of eutectoid composition is
austenitic at temperatures above 727°C. Thus, if a small furnace containing a crucible ﬁlled
with a molten salt mixture is held at 730°C, eutectoid-composition steel specimens placed
in this bath can be maintained in the austenite phase and at a temperature just above that18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 567
Chapter 18 The Iron-Carbon Alloy System 568
at which they undergo the eutectoid reaction. This furnace is shown on the left in Fig.
18.4. Just to the right of this unit is a similar furnace that also contains a salt bath butmaintains it at a temperature below 727°C. In an experiment of this type, it is convenientto use specimens in the shape of ﬂat discs about the size of a dime. A short length of tem-perature-resistant wire forms a convenient handle for use in moving the specimens fromfurnace to furnace. Metal pieces of this size, when placed in liquid salt baths, very quicklyattain the temperature of the bath. Consequently, if a specimen originally in the left-handfurnace is quickly removed and inserted into the furnace to its right, we can assume thatits temperature changes instantly from just above the eutectoid temperature to just belowit. Since austenite is no longer stable below 727°C, it is now able to decompose into otherphases. If this solid-state reaction is carried out at temperatures not too far below theeutectoid temperature, the reaction occurs by nucleation and growth and is, therefore,time dependent.
The isothermal decomposition of the austenite is usually followed with the aid of
a number of specimens (generally about ten), all of which are quenched simultane-ously from the upper temperature to the lower temperature. Individual specimens arethen removed from the second bath at increasing time intervals (usually measured ona logarithmic scale) and quickly cooled to room temperature by quenching them in abath of cold water. This latter fast-cooling effectively stops the isothermal reaction andany austenite still untransformed, at the instant of the quench, undergoes a marten-sitic (athermal) transformation as the specimen approaches room temperature. Thenature of this martensitic transformation will be covered in detail later. It suffices tostate here that it is of the same basic type as the iron-nickel transformation consideredin Chapter 17. Fortunately, steel martensite has a different appearance under themicroscope than the high-temperature reaction products of austenite. After a suitablemetallographic polish and etch, the specimens, prepared as outlined above, may beexamined metallographically and the relative amount of the isothermal-transforma-tion product determined in each case.
If austenite is allowed to transform isothermally at temperatures just below
727°C, the reaction product is the same as that predicted by the iron-carbon diagramfor a very slow, continuous cooling process. As may be seen by examining Fig. 18.5,the stable phases below the eutectoid temperature are ferrite and cementite, and theeutectoid structure is a mixture of these phases. This constituent, called pearlite, con-sists of alternate plates of Fe
3C and ferrite, with ferrite being the continuous phase.
An example of a pearlite structure is shown in Fig. 18.6. Pearlite is not a phase, but amixture of two phases—cementite and ferrite. It is, nevertheless, a constituentbecause it has a definite appearance under the microscope and can be clearly identi-fied in a structure composed of several constituents. (See Fig. 18.34.) It should be fur-ther recognized that when austenite of eutectoid composition is reacted to formpearlite just below the eutectoid temperature, the two phases appear in a definiteratio. This ratio is easily computed by using the lever rule and assuming that ferritecontains zero percent carbon.

FIG. 18.6 Pearlite consists of plates of Fe3C in a matrix of ferrite. (From Vilella, J.R.,

Since the densities of ferrite and cementite are approximately the same (7.86 and 7.4,
respectively), the lamellae of iron and Fe3C have respective widths of about 7 to 1.
The decomposition of austenite to form pearlite occurs by nucleation and growth.
Nucleation takes place heterogeneously. If the austenite is homogeneous, nucleationoccurs almost exclusively at grain boundaries. A signiﬁcant observation is that a pearlitecolony normally grows into only one of the two austenite grains at the boundary. Whenit is not homogeneous, but has concentration gradients and contains residual iron-carbideparticles, nucleation of pearlite can occur both at the grain boundaries and in the centersof the austenite grains. This would be the case if austenite, once reacted to pearlite, werere-austenitized for too short a time and then decomposed to pearlite a second time.
It is difﬁcult to observe the actual nucleation of a pearlite colony in an unaloyed iron-
carbon steel. This is because the reaction occurs at a high temperature and tends to go tocompletion when the steel is cooled to room temperature, where it can be convenientlyexamined. To fully understand the nucleation event one needs to understand the orienta-tion relationships between the austenite, the ferrite, and the cementite at a grain-boundarysite where a pearlite colony is nucleated. Simply stated, the problem is that cooling toroom temperature effectively destroys the austenite structure, thereby making it very dif-ﬁcult to determine with certainty the relations between the three phases once the metalhas been returned to room temperature. A number of investigators have attacked thisproblem with the use of certain high-alloy steels. In these steels it is possible to obtain apartial transformation of austenite to pearlite at higher temperatures and then, on coolingto room temperature, to retain the remaining austenite without it undergoing any further18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 569
Chapter 18 The Iron-Carbon Alloy System 570
transformation. Dippenaar and Honeycombe5obtained signiﬁcant results in this manner
by using a steel containing 0.79 percent carbon and 11.9 percent manganese. The speci-
mens were austenitized at 950°C for 1 hour, which gave them an austenitic grain size of50
/H9262m. Quenching their specimens to room temperature completely suppressed the trans-
formation of the austenite so that specimens possessing a 100 percent austenitic structurewere obtained on reaching room temperature. This was possible because the high man-ganese concentration of the metal made the austenite much more stable. A simple iron-carbon steel with 0.79 percent carbon steel would have been almost completely convertedto martensite by the quench. Following the quench, the specimens were reheated tobetween 400 and 650°C and allowed to transform isothermally. Because of the large man-ganese concentration in their steel, the transformation to pearlite did not go to comple-tion, but stopped after about 15 to 20 percent transformation. This, however, was sufﬁcientto allow them to study the nucleation and early development of pearlite colonies. It shouldalso be mentioned that their alloy steel results are consistent with observations made onplain-carbon steels.
As a result of this study it was concluded that there were two basic orientation rela-
tions between the cementite and ferrite lamellae in a pearlite colony, on the one hand, andthe two austenite grains, at the grain boundary where the pearlite colony nucleated, onthe other. The deciding factor determining which of these relations existed for a particularpearlite colony was the type of site at which nucleation occurred, that is, whether it hadnucleated at a “clean” austenitic grain boundary or on one containing a proeutectoidcementite layer. In the former case, both the ferrite and the cementite lamellae obtain ori-entations related to that of the austenite grain, into which the pearlite does not grow. Thisaustenite grain will now be identiﬁed by the symbol 
/H92531. The orientation relationship of the
pearlite with the austenite in /H92531has been named the Pitsch-Petch relation and in it the fer-
rite in the pearlite has a relationship to the austenite in /H92531that is close to the Kurdjumov-
Sachs relation. On the other hand, both the ferrite and the cementite in the pearlite wereobserved to have no simple crystallographic relationship with respect to the grain intowhich a pearlite colony grows. For convenience, this latter austenite grain will be desig-nated by the symbol 
/H92532.
In the case where a pearlite colony nucleates at a proeutectoid austenitic grain-
boundary cementite layer, the cementite in the pearlite was found to have the same ori-entation as the cementite in the boundary layer. Since, as pointed out above, thegrain-boundary cementite has an orientation related to 
/H92531, the cementite in the pearlite
must also have this same orientation relationship with /H92531. The orientation of the ferrite in
the pearlite, on the other hand, was found to be unrelated to the orientations of either
/H92531or /H92532. In this case, where only the cementite of the pearlite has an orientation associ-
ated with /H92531, the orientation relationship is known as the Bagaryatski relation .
In summary, it is apparent that when a pearlite colony nucleates at an austenitic
grain boundary, it grows into only one of the two grains associated with the boundary. Ifthe nucleation occurs on a boundary that does not contain proeutectoid cementite, theorientations of both the ferrite and the cementite of the pearlite are related to that of thegrain into which the pearlite does not grow, that is, 
/H92531, as shown schematically in Fig. 18.7A.
The reason for this is that the boundaries formed at the site of nucleation between theaustenite of grain 
/H92531and the ferrite and cementite lamellae of the pearlite, are low-energy
boundaries with a very low mobility. Conversely, the boundaries formed at the otherends of the ferrite and cementite lamellae with the austenite in grain 
/H92532are high-energy
boundaries with a high mobility. Consequently, the pearlite colony grows only into /H92532.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 570

FIG. 18.8 Growing cementite and ferrite lamellae may nucleate each otherOn the other hand, if the pearlite is nucleated at a boundary layer of proeutectoid cemen-
tite, it forms on a band of cementite that has a low-energy interface with respect to /H92531
and a high-energy interface with respect to /H92532. Thus, the pearlitic cementite lamellae can
grow out into /H92532as extensions of the proeutectoid cementite layer. This is illustrated
schematically in Fig. 18.7B. At the same time, while the ferrite lamellae of the pearlite
colony cannot grow into /H92531because the proeutectoid cementite layer separates them
from /H92531, they are able to grow into /H92532because a simple orientation relationship between
this ferrite and the austenite of /H92532does not exist, so that the boundaries between the fer-
rite and the austenite, at the ends of the ferrite lamellae away from the layer of proeu-
tectoid cementite, should possess high energies. This work also conﬁrmed the general
conclusion that, normally, all the ferrite lamellae in a single pearlite colony have a com-
mon orientation, and similarly, all the cementite lamellae in a pearlite colony also pos-
sess a common orientation.
It was also deduced that the nucleation of a pearlite colony can occur by sympathetic
sideways nucleation of the ferrite and cementite lamellae as indicated schematically in
Fig. 18.8. In this regard, the nucleation of a ferrite lamella should increase the carbon con-
centration of the austenite in its vicinity and favor the nucleation of an adjacent lamella of
cementite. Similarly, the nucleation of a cementite lamella should lower the carbon con-
centration of the austenite next to it and promote the nucleation of another ferrite lamella.
This process is repeatable so that as the colony grows, both the lengths of the lamellae and
the number of the lamellae tend to increase. There is also evidence that the number of the
lamellae can be increased as a result of branching of both the ferrite and cementite lamel-
lae. This process is indicated schematically in Fig. 18.9.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 571

As pointed out above, Dippenaar and Honeycombe5used a hyper-eutectoid alloy steel
(0.79 percent C, 11.9 percent Mn) in their study of the phase relations that occur during
the transformation of austenite to pearlite. This steel had the advantage that the transfor-
mation of austenite to martensite could be avoided when the steel was cooled back to
ambient temperatures. Some very signiﬁcant results have also been reported by Hackney
and Shiﬂet,7–9as a consequence of another extensive transmission electron microscope
investigation of the pearlite transformation in this steel. Their study included the use of
hot stage electron microscopy, which allowed them to follow the growth of the pearlite
colonies in in situ .
These authors present strong evidence for the belief that the growth of the
pearlite-austenite interface involves the lateral motion of steps or ledges across the
interface.10This type of growth is illustrated for the growth of proeutectic ferrite
into austenite in Fig. 18.3. In the growth of the pearlite-austenite interface, the evi-
dence is consistent with an assumption that the ledges run continuously across the
ferrite and the cementite lamellae of the pearlite. This strongly implies that the
growths of the ferrite and cementite phases of the pearlite (into the austenite) are
coupled or interconnected. In other words, the growth of pearlite occurs by an edge-
wise growth mechanism in which steps sweep laterally across the austenite-pearlite
interface as a whole.
18.4 THE GROWTH OF PEARLITE
As indicated above, the growth of a pearlite colony is accomplished in several ways:
(1) by the addition of lamellae, (2) by the branching of the lamellae, and (3) through
the extension outward of the ends of the lamellae. Because the pearlite colony has an
almost equal rate of growth in directions parallel and perpendicular to the lamellae,
a large developed pearlite nodule is often spherical in shape. Thus, when viewed on
a plane surface with a microscope, a fully developed pearlite colony usually has a
circular shape.
Pearlite colonies grow unimpeded until they impinge on adjacent colonies. During
this period, the rate of growth, as determined experimentally, is constant. This is
illustrated in Fig. 18.10. The data for a curve of this type may be obtained by reacting
a number of specimens for different lengths of time. The specimens are prepared
for metallographic examination and the diameter of the largest pearlite nodule in
each specimen is measured. The slope of the curve, obtained when the diameter is18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 572

pearlite nodules can only grow into austenite remaining between nodules, which con-
sititutes the last stage of pearlite growth.
18.5 THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE PEARLITE
TRANSFORMATION
The Interlamellar Spacing and the Rate of Growth. The
interlamellar spacing /H9261is nearly a constant in pearlite formed from austenite at a ﬁxed
temperature and in a given specimen, varying only slightly about a mean. This mean
value is generally referred to in speaking of the interlamellar spacing of pearlite. The
actual variation about the average is considerably less than one would assume from an
examination of a metallographic surface, where the spacing between lamellae may
appear to vary widely. This is caused by the fact that the plane of the surface does not
intersect all pearlite colonies at the same angle. The true spacing is only observed when
the lamellae are perpendicular to the surface. A convenient method for determining this
quantity, which has been widely used, is to take the minimum spacing that can be seen
on a metallographic specimen surface as a measure of the true spacing. Figure 18.11,
from to Ridley,11illustrates the nature of the problem of determining /H9261. In this dia-
gram, /H9261is the spacing as measured on a surface that is not normal to the pearlite lamel-
lae, while /H92610is the spacing measured on a surface normal to the lamellae. Actually, the
true spacing is not the minimum spacing observed in the plane of polish, since the true
spacing is not a single ﬁxed value but corresponds to a distribution of spacings about a
mean true value /H92610. The line on the upper surface of the crystal in Fig. 18.11 represents
a random line laid down on this surface. The distance between the centers of two
adjacent lamella along this line is designated l. A mean pearlite intercept may be
obtained by superimposing many straight lines of known length on the microstructure,l18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 573

McElroy, D. L., Trans. AIME , 197219 [1953].)in such a manner that they intersect the pearlite lamellae in all directions. The total
number of lamellae intercepted by these lines are counted and then the mean intercept
is obtained by dividing the total length of these lines by the number of the lamellae
intercepted.
It can be shown,11with the aid of several simple quantitative microscopy rela-
tions, that:

lamellar spacing.
The temperature at which austenite is transformed has a strong effect on the inter-
lamellar spacing of pearlite.12,13The lower the reaction temperature, the smaller . The
spacing of the pearlite lamellae has practical signiﬁcance because the hardness of the
resulting structure depends upon it; the smaller the spacing, the harder the metal. Pearlite
formed from austenite at temperatures just below the eutectoid temperature (700°C) has
a pearlite spacing of the order of 1.0 /H9262m. The hardness of this structure is about Rockwell
C-15, while pearlite formed at 600°C has a spacing of about 0.1 /H9262m and a corresponding
greater hardness, Rockwell C-40.
The rate of growth or the growth velocity of pearlite ( V) is also a strong function of
temperature, as can be seen by examining Fig. 18.12. At temperatures just below the
eutectoid, the growth rate increases rapidly with decreasing temperature, reaching a
maximum at 600°C, and then decreases again at lower temperatures.l0l0ll/H110052l0l

575 18.6 Forced-Velocity Growth of Pearlite
18.6 FORCED-VELOCITY GROWTH OF PEARLITE
The data shown in Figs. 18.10 and 18.12 were obtained some years ago by isothermally
transforming austenite to pearlite. In addition to isothermal studies of the transformationof austenite to pearlite, there is another recently introduced technique for this purposecalled the forced-velocity method . In a typical experiment of this type,
14the specimen con-
sists of a high-purity steel rod of eutectoid composition with a diameter of about 6.4 mm.This specimen is placed inside a concentric assembly that can be moved at a controlledﬁxed rate along the length of the specimen. This unit contains an induction heating coilthat heats a short (1 cm) length of the specimen into the austenitic region. It also containssealed cold water cooling cylinders at each end of the heated zone that produce very steeptemperature gradients on both sides of this zone. Finally, it is capable of maintaining a pro-tective vacuum or argon gas atmosphere around the heated section of the specimen. Asthis assembly is slowly translated along the specimen, the heated zone of the specimen isforced to move along the specimen and, as it does so, the cross-section of the specimen atthe rear of the heated zone transforms from austenite into pearlite. In effect, this producesa pearlite front that moves with a ﬁxed velocity, and the steep temperature gradient at thisend of the heated zone suppresses pearlite nucleation in advance of the front. As pointedout by Ridley
11this procedure is similar to that used for the production of aligned lamel-
lar structures during the freezing of eutectic alloys.
In the isothermal transformation technique, the growth rate of the pearlite is a func-
tion of the temperature. That is, the temperature is the independent variable and thegrowth velocity is the dependent variable so that if a temperature is assigned to the exper-iment, the growth velocity is determined. On the other hand, in a forced velocity experi-ment, one assigns a growth velocity and determines a transformation temperature. Acomparison between the forced velocity and the isothermal transformation techniques isgiven by Pearson and Verhoeven
14in Fig. 18.13. This shows the pearlite growth velocity,
V, plotted against /H9004T, the difference between the eutectoid and transformation tempera-
tures, on double logarithmic coordinates. All of the data in the ﬁgure are from high-purityiron-carbon specimens. Note that the forced velocity data of Pearson and Verhoeven fallon a straight line whose slope is close to /H110012. A slope of /H110012 for the log-log plot in Fig. 18.13
strongly implies that /H9004Tis proportional to V
1/2or that we may write:
/H9004T/H11005K1V1/218.3
where K1is a constant. Equation 18.3 is equivalent to Eq. 14.51, which was deduced the-
oretically for the freezing of an eutectic alloy. The eutectoid transformation of austenite topearlite is analogous to the freezing of an eutectic alloy, so the theories of both transforma-tions are similar. Thus, it is not surprising that the empirical relation in Eq. 18.3 supportsEq. 14.51. Note that different symbols are used for the variables in these two equations.Thus K
1in Eq. 18.3 is equivalent to ABin Eq. 14.51 and the growth rate or growth veloc-
ity, V, in Eq. 18.3 is the same as Rin Eq. 14.51. As mentioned above, Fig. 18.13 also con-
tains data obtained from a number of isothermal transformation studies. These data arein good agreement with the forced velocity data for pearlite growth velocities less than20
/H9262m/s, which corresponds to a supercooling, /H9004T, of about 50 K. For velocities greater
then 20 /H9262m, the isothermal data scatter to both sides of the line of slope /H110012. This scatter
has been attributed by Pearson and Verhoeven to the fact that at higher growth velocitiesin an isothermal experiment, problems associated with measuring the growth velocity18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 575

occur since it is very difﬁcult to accurately measure the time variable of a transformation
when the total reaction time is very short, as is the case at large growth velocities.
In the eutectic freezing section in Chapter 14 on solidiﬁcation, it was predicted in
Eq. 14.50 that the interlammelar spacing in an eutectic alloy should vary as the inverse
square root of the growth velocity. In other words:
/H9261/H11005K2/H20862V1/218.4
where K2is a constant equivalent to B/Ain Eq. 14.50. When Eq. 18.4 is expressed in dou-
ble logarithmic notation by plotting log Vagainst log /H9261, one should obtain a straight line
with a slope of /H110022. As may be seen in Fig. 18.14, where forced velocity data from four
sources are plotted, the experimental data agree well with Eq. 18.4.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 576

Finally, it must be pointed out that there are three primary variables in the pearlite
transformation: (1) the undercooling, /H9004T; (2) the growth velocity, V; and (3) the inter-
lamellar spacing, /H9261. These variables are interrelated. The relation between Vand /H9004Tis

early with /H9004Twith a slope of /H110021. This conforms to:

Note that Fig. 18.15 contains both isothermal and forced-velocity data. The relationship
between the variables in Fig. 18.15 can also be obtained easily from Eqs. 18.3 and 18.4. If

18.7 THE EFFECTS OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS ON THE GROWTH
OF PEARLITE
Most commercial steels contain alloying elements. Even the class of steels called “plain-
carbon steels” may contain between 0.5 and 1.0 percent of manganese and between 0.15
and 0.30 percent of silicon. The existence of these elements in plain-carbon steels is nor-
mally required in order that they may be produced economically. The low-alloy steels,
which are also an important class, may contain additional alloying elements, such as
cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, and nickel in concentrations that in some cases may
equal or exceed several percent. Furthermore, in some low-alloy steels, the manganese
concentration may exceed that normally found in the plain-carbon steels and be as high
as 5 percent. Since all of these steels are normally capable of undergoing an austenite to
pearlite transformation, knowledge about how these alloying elements inﬂuence the
transformation is important.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 578
579 18.7 The Effects of Alloying Elements on the Growth of Pearlite
There are several well known effects that the common alloying elements can have on
the austenite to pearlite transformation. These are:
1. An alloying element can change the eutectoid temperature. Elements such as Ni
and Mn, which tend to make austenite more stable, act to decrease the eutectoid
temperature. On the other hand, elements such as Si, Cr, and Mo increase theeutectoid temperature.
2. The presence of an alloying element may change the rate at which the pearlite
reaction occurs. In general, the only element that is not known to appreciablyretard the pearlite transformation is cobalt. All others act to generally retard thetransformation. Since Si, Cr, and Mo raise the eutectoid temperature, the pearlitetransformation tends to occur earlier at high temperatures in steels with these ele-ments than it does in plain-carbon steels. However, at lower transformation tem-peratures, the transformation rates in these steels are usually slower than those inpure iron-carbon steels.
3. The various alloying elements may be partitioned between the ferrite and the
cementite in the pearlite as a result of the pearlite transformation. Thismeans that the alloying element that was in solution in the gamma phasedoes not remain solely in the alpha phase after the transformation. Part of itmay be incorporated into the cementite. Thus, the cementite in the pearliteis not simply Fe
3C but may have some iron atoms replaced by atoms of the
alloying element.
Tewari and Sharma15have summarized the signiﬁcant factors associated with the par-
titioning of the alloying elements. They point out that:
1. The partitioning of the alloying elements between the ferrite and the cementite
of the pearlite is required by thermodynamics when the transformation occursunder approximately equilibrium conditions. In effect, the redistribution of thealloying elements is a growth requirement for temperatures just below theeutectoid temperature. Thus, partitioning is favored by a low degree of supersat-uration or when the undercooling, /H9004T, is small. Alloying elements that have a
strong afﬁnity for carbon and are known as carbideforming elements shouldhave a strong tendency to partition to the cementite of the pearlite. Elements inthis class are manganese, chromium, and molybdenum. On the other hand, ele-ments such as silicon, nickel, and cobalt are expected to concentrate in the fer-rite of the pearlite.
2. If the supersaturation of the carbon is high, as with a large degree of undercool-
ing and a correspondingly fast rate of transformation, it may be possible tocompletely suppress the partitioning.
3. In the temperature interval where partitioning occurs, the pearlite growth
rate is controlled by the diffusion of the alloying element along the grainboundaries. On the other hand, at lower temperatures where partitioningdoes not occur, the growth rate is controlled by the volume diffusion of thecarbon atoms.
4. In general, a temperature may exist above which partitioning occurs and below
which it does not occur. This partition-no-partition transition temperature is char-acteristic of the composition of the alloy, and decreases for any given alloying ele-ment with an increase in its concentration.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 579

Some of the effects that alloying elements can have on pearlite are illustrated in
Figs. 18.16 and 18.17. In particular, Fig. 18.16 shows a set of 1/ /H9261against Tplots correspon-
ding to four eutectoid steels containing from 0.4 to 1.8 percent of chromium and two steels
with 1.08 and 1.08 percent of manganese, respectively. Note that with increasing
chromium the plots are displaced upward and to the right, while with increasing man-
ganese concentration they move in the opposite direction. In addition, the dashed line rep-
resenting an unalloyed iron-carbon eutectoid steel falls between those of the two alloy
classes. Finally, it can be observed that for all of these compositions the data fall reason-
ably well on straight lines.
Figure 18.17 is interesting since it shows the variation with temperature of three
important pearlite transformation parameters in a 1 percent manganese eutectoid steel.

on the right is the partitioning parameter. Note that the partitioning parameter is large,
that is, about 3.0, just below the eutectoid temperature and that it decreases as the
temperature is decreased so that at approximately 670°C its value is close to one. A parti-
tioning parameter of 1.0 signiﬁes that there is no partitioning. Thus, 670°C is approxi-
mately the no-partitioning temperature of this steel.
18.8 THE RATE OF NUCLEATION OF PEARLITE
The rate of nucleation is the number of nuclei that form in a unit volume (usually a cubic
millimeter) per second. As previously mentioned, in austenite of homogeneous com-
position, nuclei normally form heterogeneously at grain boundaries. Unlike the
isothermal growth rate, the isothermal rate of nucleation is a function of time. This is
shown in Fig. 18.18. In order to compare nucleation rates at different temperatures, it
is necessary to consider the average nucleation rate for each temperature. The varia-
tion of the average Nwith temperature is shown in Fig. 18.19. Plotted on this same ﬁg-
ure is the rate of growth as a function of temperature. Much about the changes in
pearlitic structure that occur as a function of temperature can be deduced from a study
of these curves.
Let us ﬁrst consider a temperature only slightly below the eutectoid temperature,
973 K (700°C). At this temperature, the rate of nucleation is very small, approaching
zero. The growth rate, on the other hand, has a ﬁnite value between 10/H110023and 10/H110024mm
per sec mm/s. Only a few pearlite nuclei form and, because of the relatively high growth
rate, the nuclei grow into large pearlite nodules. The nodules, in fact, grow to sizes much
larger than the original austenite grains; nodule growth proceeds across austenite grain
boundaries.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 581

Sons, Inc., New York, 1951, p. 545.)
Because of the scarcity of pearlite nuclei and the long distances between nuclei form-
ing at these high temperatures, they may be considered to form randomly throughout the
austenite in spite of the fact that they actually form at grain boundaries. If it is now
assumed, ﬁrst, that the rate of nucleation Nis constant (the average nucleation rate); sec-
ond, that the nodules maintain a spherical shape as they grow (until they impinge on each
other); and, third, that the growth rate Gis constant, then it has been shown by Johnson
and Mehl16that the fraction of austenite transformed to pearlite is given as a function of
time by the following reaction equation:
f(t)/H110051/H11002e(/H11002/H9266/3)NG3t418.7
where f(t) is the fraction of austenite transformed to pearlite, Nis the nucleation rate, Gis
the growth rate, and tis the time. The typical sigmoidal curve that results when the reac-
tion curve is plotted is shown in Fig. 18.20.
As the reaction temperature is lowered, the rate of nucleation increases at a
much faster rate than the rate of growth, and more and more pearlite colonies are
nucleated the lower the reaction temperature. One of the consequences is that at an
early stage in the transformation, the austenite grain boundaries become outlined
by the large number of pearlite colonies that form along them. Instead of one
pearlite nodule growing large enough to consume a number of austenite grains,
there are now a number of pearlite nodules growing into a single austenite grain.
Under these conditions, it is no longer possible to think in terms of random nucle-
ation. We should think, rather, in terms of grain-boundary nucleation. The analysis
of the transformation is now mathematically more difficult, but it has been carried
out.16For such cases, the transformation rate depends on the austenite grain size. It
has been shown that the transformation rate decreases with increasing the austenite
grain size.1718Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 582

18.9 TIME-TEMPERATURE-TRANSFORMATION CURVES
Information of a very important and practical nature can be obtained from a series of
isothermal reaction curves determined at a number of temperatures. First, consider the
theoretical curve of Fig. 18.20. Experimental counterparts of this curve are obtained by
isothermally reacting a number of specimens for different lengths of time and determin-
ing the fraction of the transformation product in each specimen. A plot of these data as a
function of the reaction time gives the desired curve, one of which is shown in the upper
diagram of Fig. 18.21.
From this reaction curve the time required to start the transformation and the time
required to complete the transformation may be obtained. This is done in practice by
observing the time to get a ﬁnite amount of transformation product, usually 1 percent,
corresponding to the start of the transformation. The end of the transformation is then
arbitrarily taken as the time to transform 99 percent of the austenite to pearlite. A plot of
these data for a series of temperatures gives Fig. 18.22, which is clearly not an equilibrium
diagram, but still a form of phase diagram. It shows the time relationships for the phases
during isothermal transformation. The area to the left of the ﬁrst C-shaped curve corre-
sponds to structures that are austenitic. Any point to the right of the second of these two
curves represents a pearlitic structure and is, consequently, a mixture of two phases
(cementite and ferrite). Between the two curves is a region of pearlite and austenite with
the relative ratios of these two constituents varying from all austenite to all pearlite as one
moves from left to right.
One of the signiﬁcant factors about the pearlite transformation is the very short time
required to form pearlite at temperatures around 873 K (600°C). This, of course, could
have been deduced from the information of Fig. 18.20, where it can be seen that at this
temperature both the rate of nucleation and the rate of growth have a maximum.
The time-temperature-transformation ( T-T-T ) diagram of Fig. 18.22 corresponds only
to the reaction of austenite to pearlite. It is not complete in the sense that the transforma-
tions of austenite, which occur at temperatures below about 823 K (550°), are not shown.
To complete this study, it is necessary to consider two other types of austenitic reactions:
austenite to bainite and austenite to martensite.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 583

The bainite reaction will be covered in the next section and the martensite reaction
in steels in Chapter 19. With regard to the martensite reaction, it can be stated that in
the present eutectoid steel, the reaction is primarily athermal. The horizontal lines
drawn in Fig. 18.22 show the Ms(martensite start) temperature and the temperatures at
which certain indicated fractions of martensite are obtained. It goes without saying that
martensite only forms if the steel, on cooling, does not transform to pearlite at higher
temperatures.
18.10 THE BAINITE REACTION
The bainite reaction is still perhaps the least understood and most controversial of all the
austenite reactions.18–21There are a number of reasons for this. Bainite is formed over a
rather wide temperature range. The morphology of the bainite microstructure is also very
diverse. It has long been recognized that there were signiﬁcant differences between
bainites formed at higher temperatures (roughly between 300 and 500°C) and those
formed at lower temperatures (approximately from 200 to 300°C). This has led to the des-
ignations upper bainite and lower bainite , respectively, for the bainites formed inside these
two temperature regimes. Furthermore, within each of these temperature intervals the
bainite morphology tends to be diverse. Thus, it has been recently shown that in a Cr-Ni18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 584

completion. (After Hehemann, R. F., and Troiano,
A. R., Metal Progress , 70, No. 2, 97 [1956].)alloy steel, upper bainite may assume three basically different morphologies.18Similarly,
the morphology of lower bainite may take different forms. The mechanisms by which
austenite transforms to bainite are also complicated and remain a source of considerable
controversy. It is particularly difﬁcult to investigate the bainite reaction in simple iron-
carbon steels because the bainite transformation tends to overlap the austenite to pearlite
reaction [at temperatures of the order of 773 K (500°C)]. Steels transformed in this tem-
perature range have structures containing both pearlite and bainite. In certain alloy steels,
the presence of the proper alloying elements in substitutional solid solution (in the austen-
ite) has the effect of separating the temperature ranges in which the respective pearlite and
bainite reactions occur. The bainite reaction is much more readily studied in these alloys.
Some of the conclusions obtained from these investigations are characteristic of bainite
reactions in general and can be applied to simple iron-carbon alloys.
The most puzzling feature of the bainite reaction is its dual nature. In a number of
respects, it reveals properties typical of a nucleation and growth type of transformation
such as the pearlite transformation. At the same time, it shows an equal number that
would classify it as a martensitic type of reaction. Like pearlite, the reaction product of the
bainite transformation is not a phase but a mixture of ferrite and carbide. In the bainite
transformation, the carbon that is uniformly distributed in the austenite is concentrated
into localized regions of high-carbon content (the carbide particles), leaving an effectively
carbon-free matrix (the ferrite). The bainite reaction thus involves compositional changes
and requires the diffusion of carbon. In this it differs markedly from a typical martensitic
transformation. Another property of the bainite reaction that differentiates it from marten-
sitic reactions is that it is not athermal. The formation of bainite requires time, and when
austenite is reached to bainite isothermally, a typical S-shaped reaction curve is obtained,
as can be seen in Fig. 18.23. The similarity of this curve to those obtained in simple nucle-
ation and growth transformations can be seen by comparing it with that previously pre-
sented in the discussion dealing with the pearlite reactions. Another set of isothermal
reaction curves are shown in Fig. 18.24. These were obtained by Okamoto and Oka22
using a high-purity hypereutectoid iron-carbon steel containing 1.10 percent of carbon
that was isothermally reacted at ﬁve temperatures between 663 and 422 K (390 to 149°C).
The progress of the reaction was followed at each temperature with a dilatometer. Since
the Mstemperature for this composition is about 450 K, Curve 5 lies below Msand the bai-
nite region. The other four curves lie in the lower bainite region. Note that all the curves
were ﬁtted to the Johnson-Mehl equation (Eq. 18.7). It is also interesting that these
authors identiﬁed two basically different lower bainite morphologies in their hypereutec-
toid steels, adding further evidence of the complexity of the bainite transformation.
While bainite and pearlite are both mixtures of ferrite and carbide, the mechanism of
bainite formation differs from that of pearlite. The resulting product also does not have the
alternating arrangement of parallel lamellae of ferrite and cementite found in pearlite.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 585

As we have seen, pearlite, due to almost equal growth rates in all directions, tends to
develop in the form of spheres. This is not true of bainite, which grows largely as plates or
lathes—a typical martensitic characteristic. When observed on a metallographic section,
bainite often has a characteristic acicular (needlelike) appearance, which in many respects
is similar to that of deformation twins and martensite plates. The formation of bainite
plates is also accompanied by surface distortions (surface tilts and accommodation kinks),
which has led many authors to conclude that lattice shear is involved in the formation of
the plates. A basic difference, however, between the bainite and martensite plates lies in
the speed of their formation. Martensite plates are in most cases formed under the condi-
tion of a high-driving force and they grow to their ﬁnal sizes in a small fraction of a sec-
ond, whereas bainite plates grow slowly and continuously. The growth of bainite plates is
apparently retarded by the time required for the diffusion processes that accompany the
reaction. However, if bainite forms by a process involving shear displacements, one has to
consider the possibility that the relaxation of the accommodation strains, associated with
the formation of bainite plates, should be a factor. Relaxation of these strains should be
possible by recovery processes at the temperatures where bainite forms. Their relaxation
might make either the continued growth of the bainite lamellae or the nucleation of addi-
tional lamellae possible.
A signiﬁcant paper relative to bainite has been published by Bhadeshia and Edmunds,23
who used a steel with 0.43 percent C, 3.0 percent Mn, and 2.12 percent Si. In this steel, the
bainite transformation occurred slowly and allowed a thorough study of the bainite reac-
tion to be obtained. Bhadeshia and Edmunds were able to produce evidence that the trans-
formation reactions leading to upper and lower bainite, respectively, were different. In
proof of this, two distinct “C” curves may be seen in the time-temperature-transformation
(T-T-T) diagram for their steel in Fig. 18.25. This diagram was obtained by isothermally
reacting their alloy specimens for different times at several ﬁxed temperatures. The solid
line curves correspond to the time to obtain a transformation of 5 percent at the various
temperatures. The dashed lines on either side of the solid line merely show the scatter of18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 586

their data. They are not boundaries showing other percentages of transformation. More
recent data for isothermal transformation of 1.2 percent C steel also gives two separate
curves for the upper and lower bainites.20
Normally, the microstructure of upper bainite is composed of lath- or plate-shaped
ferrite elements arranged in packets or sheaves with layers of carbide in between the fer-
rite laths. Because of the extremely ﬁne structure of this bainite, it is necessary to use an
electron microscope to resolve its components. Figure 18.26 shows several upper bainite
plates in an electron micrograph made at a magniﬁcation of 15,000 /H11003. The irregular dark
areas are ferrite regions, while the light areas inside them are the carbide particles. The
upper bainite shown in this photograph was formed at a relatively high transformation
temperature (approximately 733 K). Lower bainite differs in appearance from upper bai-
nite in that the structure is normally coarser and the carbides lie inside the ferrite plates.
This is illustrated in Fig. 18.27 for a specimen isothermally transformed at approximately
523 K, where the ferrite plates have a more regular and needlelike shape in the plane of
the specimen surface than those in Fig. 18.26. At the same time, the carbide particles,
which appear in this latter ﬁgure as rather coarse structures paralleling the length of the
ferrite plate, assume a different aspect. They become smaller in size and appear as cross-
striations,24making an angle of about 55° to the axis of the plate. (See Fig. 18.27.) The
net result of this change in the structure of bainite with transformation temperature is a
variation in its appearance under the light microscope (that is, at lower magniﬁcations).
To illustrate this point, Fig. 18.28 shows the appearance of bainite formed at two differ-
ent isothermal temperatures.
Something should be said about the nature of the carbides that appear in bainite. It
would seem that in carbon steels transformed to bainite at temperatures above 573 K
(300°C), the carbides are simply cementite, Fe3C.25It has been recognized for some time
that in bainite formed at lower temperatures [below 573 K (300°C)], carbide other than18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 587

cementite may form. Investigations have shown that this carbide is often epsilon ( /H9255)
carbide,25which has a hexagonal crystal structure instead of the orthorhombic structure
of cementite. The carbon concentration in epsilon carbide also differs from that of cemen-
tite and is about 8.4 percent instead of 6.7 percent.
With regard to the two basic forms of bainite, that is, upper bainite and lower bainite,
the habit plane of upper bainite is close to {111}/H9253while that of lower bainite is irrational.
According to Sandvik,26while a number of nonacicular forms of bainite, such as granular
bainite, columnar bainite, and grain-boundary bainitic allotriomorphs, have been
observed, these are detected only under special conditions. Consequently, we may assume
that the two major bainite forms are upper bainite and lower bainite.
An interesting feature of the bainite reaction is that in alloy steels, bainite does
not form until the temperature at which austenite is isothermally reacted falls below
a definite temperature, designated as Bs(bainite start temperature). Above Bsausten-
ite does not form bainite except in the presence of externally applied stresses. Further,
at temperatures just below Bs, austenite does not transform completely to bainite. The
amount of bainite formed increases as the isothermal reaction temperature is lowered,18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 588

as is shown schematically in Fig. 18.29. Below a lower limiting temperature, Bf
(bainite finish), it is thus possible to transform austenite completely to bainite. The
analogy between the temperature dependence of the bainite reaction and the temper-ature dependence of a martensitic reaction is apparent. The B
sand Bftemperatures are
the equivalent of the Msand Mftemperatures, and the curve of Fig. 18.29 is very sim-
ilar to those shown in Chapter 17 giving the amount of athermal martensite formedas a function of temperature.

tion of austenite that is untransformed when the steel is reacted between B

If cooled to room temperature, however,the remaining austenite, or some fraction of it, undergoes the martensite transformation.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 589

In simple iron-carbon alloys that undergo isothermal transformation in the region where
the pearlite-bainite overlap occurs, it can be assumed that the austenite that is not trans-
formed to bainite goes to pearlite.
The fact that the bainite transformation does not go to completion in the temper-
ature interval Bsto Bfimplies that in this range of temperatures both nucleation and
growth stop before all of the austenite is consumed. Thus, a ﬁnite number of nuclei
must form, which grow to typical bainite plates. The limitation on the growth of these
plates is not difﬁcult to understand. A bainite plate can grow until it intersects another
plate, or an austenite grain boundary. Alternatively, the growth of bainite plates can be
limited by a loss of coherency between the ferrite in the plate and the parent austen-
ite. On the other hand, the reasons why nucleation stops are not easy to determine.
At this point, it should be mentioned that the dual nature of the bainite transfor-
mation, that is, with both nucleation and growth as well as martensitic characteristics,
has produced proponents favoring either one or the other as the dominant factor in the
bainite reaction. This has resulted in a longstanding controversy which has run for over
half a century.27On the one hand, there are those who support the diffusion-controlled
reaction model, which views28the bainitic reaction as a nonlamellar eutectoid reaction
and considers that bainite is a nonlamellar counterpart of pearlite. This group consid-
ers that bainitic ferrite grows by the diffusion-controlled movement of ledges along the
alpha-gamma ferrite plate boundaries. This mechanism is the same as that proposed for
the Widmannstätten growth of proeutectoid ferrite, which is described in Sec. 18.2. The18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 590
591 18.11 The Complete T-T-T Diagram of an Eutectoid Steel
mechanism effectively assumes that the carbon concentration in the ferrite is low,
implying that the austenite should be enriched in carbon. Thus, the carbides areexpected to form on the austenite side of the austenite-ferrite boundary and grow intothe austenite. The experimental evidence tends to support the concept that the carbidesare precipitated in upper bainite on the austenite side of the boundaries. On the otherhand, in lower bainite, the empirical evidence gives some support to the belief that thecarbides precipitate in the ferrite.
The alternate view
28of the bainite transformation considers that bainite is formed by
a shear mechanism. It is primarily based on the many morphological and crystallographicsimilarities between martensite and bainite. Some of these were described earlier in thissection. These similarities have, in general, not conclusively established the shear or dis-placive theory as the basic mechanism for bainite. It has also been argued
28that these sim-
ilarities are consistent with the concept of a nonlamellar eutectoid bainite reaction. Morerecently, Yasuya Ohmori
29has concluded that bainite formation likely consists of two steps
of lattice deformations via individual atomic jump at the interface followed by latticeinvariant shear.
18.11 THE COMPLETE T-T-T DIAGRAM OF AN EUTECTOID STEEL
The time-temperature-transformation ( T-T-T ) diagram of Fig. 18.21 is shown again in
Fig. 18.30. In the latter ﬁgure, however, the curves corresponding to the start and ﬁn-ish of transformation are extended into the range of temperatures where austenitetransforms to bainite. Because the pearlite and bainite transformations overlap in asimple eutectoid iron-carbon steel, the transition from the pearlite reaction to the bai-nite reaction is smooth and continuous. Above approximately 800 to 900 K, austenitetransforms completely to pearlite. Below this temperature to approximately 700 K,both pearlite and bainite are formed. Finally, between 700 and 483 K, the reactionproduct is bainite only.
An interesting feature of the bainite reaction is that as the reaction temperature is low-
ered, the rate at which bainite forms decreases. Accordingly, very long times are requiredto form bainite just above the M
stemperature.
The signiﬁcance of the dotted line that runs between the two curves, marking the
beginning and end of isothermal transformations, should be mentioned. This represents,at any given temperature, the time to transform half the austenite to bainite or austeniteto pearlite, as the case may be.
Let us consider some arbitrary time-temperature paths along which it is assumed
austenitized specimens are carried to room temperature. These are shown in Fig. 18.31and represent exercises for showing the principles of the use of time-temperature-transformation ( T-T-T ) diagrams.
PATH 1 The specimen is cooled rapidly to 433 K and left there 20 min. The rate of cool-
ing is too rapid for pearlite to form at higher temperatures; therefore, the steel remainsin the austenitic phase until the Ms temperature is passed, where martensite begins toform athermally. Since 433 K (160°C) is the temperature at which half of the austenitetransforms to martensite, the direct quench converts 50 percent of the structure tomartensite. Holding at 433 K forms only a very small quantity of additional martensitebecause in simple carbon steels, isothermal transformation to martensite occurs only to a18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 591

very limited extent. At point 1, accordingly, the structure can be assumed to be half
martensite and half retained austenite.
PATH 2 In this case, the specimen is held at 523 K (250°C) for 100 s. This is not sufﬁ-
ciently long to form bainite, so that the second quench from 523 K to room temperature
develops a martensitic structure.

bainite and half austenite. Cooling quickly from this temperature to room temperature

18.12 SLOWLY COOLED HYPOEUTECTOID STEELS
The steel region of the iron-carbon diagram is reproduced again in Fig. 18.32. Alloys to the
left of the eutectoid point are arbitrarily designated as hypoeutectoid, while those to the
right are known as hypereutectoid. In the above discussion, attention has been directed
primarily to a consideration of the eutectoid composition. The transformations that
austenite undergoes in steels, whose compositions fall on the low, or hypoeutectoid, side
of the eutectoid point, will now be considered. A typical hypoeutectoid composition is rep-
resented by line ac. At point athis alloy is austenitic. Its transformation, on very slow cool-
ing, starts when the temperature reaches point b. At this time the alloy enters a two-phase
ﬁeld of ferrite and austenite. When this happens, ferrite begins to nucleate heteroge-
neously at the grain boundaries of the austenite, as indicated in Fig. 18.33A. With contin-
ued slow-cooling to point c, the ferrite grains grow in size. Since the ferrite is very low in
carbon ( /H110210.02 percent C), its growth is associated with a rejection of carbon from the
interface back into the austenite, and a corresponding increase in the carbon content of
the austenite. The two-phase mixture that is obtained when the alloy is cooled to point c
is shown in Fig. 18.33B. Notice that each austenite grain is now surrounded by a network18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 593

of ferrite crystals. The pertinent data concerning this two-phase mixture are easily deduced
from Fig. 18.32. By the lever rule, we have:
and the intersections of the tie lines with the single-phase boundaries show us that the
ferrite must contain 0.02 percent C and the austenite 0.77 percent C. The structure thus
consists of two-thirds austenite and one-third ferrite in which the austenite has the
eutectoid composition and is just above the eutectoid temperature. Slow cooling of
this metal through the eutectoid temperature transforms the remaining austenite to
pearlite, so that the structure at point dconsists of a mixture of ferrite and pearlite. (See
Fig. 18.33C.) The ratio of ferrite to pearlite is, of course, the same as the ratio of ferrite to
austenite which obtains at point c, namely, 1 to 3. Continued cooling of the alloy to room
temperature causes no visible change in the microstructure. Theoretically, a change
should occur since the solubility of carbon in ferrite decreases with temperature, but the
quantity of carbon involved is very small, since at the eutectoid temperature ferrite only
dissolves 0.022 percent C.
For most practical purposes, in making lever-rule computations one can assume that
the carbon content of ferrite is zero. If this assumption is made, then the part of the struc-
ture of a hypoeutectoid steel that is pearlite varies directly as the ratio of the carbon con-
tent of the steel divided by the eutectoid composition 0.77 percent. Thus, a 0.2 percent C
steel should have a structure with approximately one-fourth pearlite, and a steel with a
structure composed of half pearlite should have a carbon content of about 0.4 percent C.
The microstructures of several slowly cooled hypoeutectoid steels are shown in Fig. 18.34.
The structure of a hypoeutectoid steel serves to show the difference between the
phase and constituent concepts. In any one of the photographs of Fig. 18.34, two basic
types of structures are clearly evident: the white ferrite areas and the dark pearlitic areas.
The constituents of these specimens are, accordingly, pearlite and ferrite. The phases in The amount of austenite /H110050.52/H110020.02

these structures are, however, ferrite and cementite. In each specimen, cementite is local-
ized in the pearlitic areas, while the ferrite occurs both in the pearlite and in the simple
ferrite grains. While there is no basic difference between the two forms of ferrite, it is
sometimes convenient to differentiate between them. Ferrite that appears in the pearlite
is called the eutectoid ferrite , while the other is the proeutectoid ferrite . The Greek preﬁx “pro”
is used to designate the latter because, on cooling, it forms before the eutectoid-structure
(pearlite) forms.
The relative amounts of the two phases in a steel are also found by the lever rule. In
this case, the levers extend to the compositons of the phases (ferrite 0 percent and cemen-
tite 6.7 percent), instead of to the compositions of the constituents (proeutectoid ferrite 0
percent C and pearlite 0.77 percent C).
18.13 SLOWLY COOLED HYPEREUTECTOID STEELS
Steels having a carbon content that falls above the eutectoid point transform in a fash-
ion similar to those laying below the eutectoid composition. The proeutectoid con-
stituent in this case is cementite instead or ferrite which, for a typical composition
(1.2 percent C) (Fig. 18.35), forms between point hand ias the temperature is lowered18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 595

along line gk. At point i, the structure is a mixture of cementite (6.7 percent C) and
austenite (0.77 percent C). A lever-rule computation shows that 92.7 percent of the
structure is austenite and 7.3 percent is cementite. The precipitation of the proeutec-
toid cementite reduces the carbon content of the austenite to that of the eutectoid
point. As a result, slowly lowering the temperature of the specimen through the eutec-
toid temperature converts the remaining austenite to pearlite. Continued cooling of the
specimen to room temperature in this case also causes no visible change in the
microstructure, so that the structure obtained at point jmay be taken as representative
of that visible at room temperature, which is 7.3 percent proeutectoid cementite and
92.7 percent pearlite, which are the constituents of the structure. The phases are
cementite and ferrite. The latter can be determined with the aid of the lever rule and
shown to be 18 percent total cementite (eutectoid plus proeutectoid) and 82 percent
ferrite (all contained in the pearlite).
A typical hypereutectoid structure is shown in Fig. 18.36. Hypereutectoid microstruc-
tures usually differ in appearance from hypoeutectoid ones. The most important differ-
ence is in the amount of the proeutectoid constituent. In the above example (1.2 percent
C steel that lies 0.43 percent above the eutectoid point) there is only 7.3 percent proeu-
tectoid cementite. At an approximately equal distance in weight percent on the other side
of the eutectoid point, 0.4 percent C, the structure contains 50 percent proeutectoid fer-
rite. A particular characteristic of hypereutectoid microstructures is the small amount of
the proeutectoid constituent. In the photograph of Fig. 18.36, which is of a 1.1 percent C
steel, the proeutectoid cementite appears as a ﬁne network surrounding pearlite areas, as
may be seen by studying the boundary around the large pearlite colony occupying the
center of the photograph. Each pearlite region was a single austenite grain before the
transformation. The proeutectoid cementite thus forms heterogeneously at the austenite
grain boundaries.
Another important difference between the structures of low- and high-carbon steels
is that in steels ferrite is the continuous phase and cementite the surrounded phase. Thus,
the proeutectoid cementite, while outlining the austenite grain boundaries, still consists of
a number of disconnected plates. Conversely, proeutectoid ferrite often completely sur-
rounds pearlite areas in the form of a number of contiguous grains.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 596

18.14 ISOTHERMAL TRANSFORMATION DIAGRAMS 
FOR NONEUTECTOID STEELS
Isothermal transformation diagrams ( T-T-T ) for both a hypoeutectoid steel (0.35 percent C)
and a hypereutectoid steel (1.13 percent C) are shown in Figs. 18.37 and 18.38, respec-
tively. The similarity between these diagrams and that of the eutectoid steel are at onceapparent, but there are, nevertheless, important differences. Among the latter is the pres-ence in both ﬁgures of the line mncorresponding to the start of the isothermal transfor-
mation of the proeutectoid constituent. In each case, the designated line lies above and tothe left of those deﬁning the isothermal transformation of austenite to pearlite. Notice thatthese lines are asymptotic (at large times) to constant temperature lines made on each ﬁg-ure to pass through the temperatures at which the two given alloys are ﬁrst able to formthe proeutectoid constituents (ferrite and cementite, respectively) on very slow cooling.
The isothermal-transformation diagram for a hypoeutectoid steel is reproduced again
in Fig. 18.39. Several arbitrary cooling paths are made in this diagram in order to illustratethe complete signiﬁcance of all the lines shown.
In each case, it is assumed that the specimens are austenitized at 1113 K (840°C),
which is some 40 K above the temperature at which ferrite is able to ﬁrst form in this com-position. Along Path 1 it is assumed that the specimen is instantly quenched to 1023 K(750°C) and held at this temperature for 1 hr. During the ﬁrst second of this isothermal18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 597

treatment, the structure remains entirely austenitic, but at the end of this second the curve
designating the start of the ferrite nucleation is crossed and ferrite begins to form. From
this point on to the end of 10,000 s (2.8 h) the structure lies in the two-phase austenite-
ferrite region. Because of the large length of time at this temperature, the amount of fer-
rite formed should be close to that predicted by the equilibrium diagram for this
temperature. No pearlite should form because we are still above the eutectoid temperature
[1000 K (727°C)]. In the diagram, Path 1 is completed by a quench to room temperature,
which should transform any austenite left at 1023 K (750°C) almost completely to
martensite, so that the ﬁnal structure can be assumed to consist of ferrite and martensite.
Path 2 represents one in which the specimen is assumed to be isothermally transformed
at a temperature below the eutectoid temperature, and for this purpose 923 K (650°C) has
been selected. Because of the extreme rapidity with which ferrite forms from austenite in
this temperature range, even a very rapid quench (cooling time less than 0.5 s) cannot sup-
press the formation of some ferrite during the quench. As a result, the specimen starts its
isothermal transformation as a mixture of ferrite and austenite. The transformation to
pearlite in this temperature range is also very rapid and the latter begins to form at once.
During this period, from about 0.5 s (the assumed start of the transformation) to the end of
100 s, the austenite is transformed to pearlite. The specimen may be assumed to be com-
pletely transformed at the end of 100 s and to consist of a mixture of ferrite and pearlite.
Cooling to room temperature at any normal rate of cooling does not change this structure.18Ch18.qxd  11/6/08  3:59 PM  Page 598

Transformations of the type indicated above, in which a hypoeutectoid specimen
is quickly cooled to a fixed temperature and allowed to transform at this temperature,
represent a nonequilibrium irreversible transformation. One of the results is that the
ratio of ferrite to pearlite that is obtained is not the same as that obtained on a very
slow continuous cooling cycle approaching an equilibrium transformation. The
amount of ferrite in the irreversible process is usually smaller, which means that the
amount of pearlite in the final microstructure is greater. This increase cannot occur
without a corresponding change in the composition of pearlite: normally, on slow
cooling, cementite and ferrite. Transformations of hypoeutectoid steels at temper-
atures below the eutectoid point, therefore, tend to suppress the amount of proeutec-
toid ferrite and lower the carbon content of the eutectoid structure (the pearlite). At
this point it is well to point out that there is a corresponding effect in the case of
hypereutectoid compositions. Transformations that occur below the eutectoid temper-
ature tend to suppress the amount of the proeutectoid cementite and, accordingly, to
raise the carbon concentration of the pearlite.
The great rapidity with which ferrite and pearlite form in the particular alloy under
consideration precludes the formation of a microstructure that is all bainite. As Fig. 18.39
shows, a quench that takes even as short a period as 0.5 s to reach 673 K (400°C) still
passes through the lines designating the start of the ferrite and pearlite transformations. A
specimen quickly cooled and held at 673 K (400°C) for about 100 s (Path 3), accordingly,
contains bainite mixed with a small amount of ferrite and pearlite. Finally, a direct quench7

to room temperature should furnish a hardened specimen containing a high percentage of
martensite, but with also unavoidable small percentages of ferrite and pearlite.
An analysis similar to the above can be carried out for the hypereutectoid steel shown
in Fig. 18.38. The principal difference will be in the nature of the proeutectoid constituent—
cementite instead of ferrite.
PROBLEMS
18.1 The Johnson-Mehl equation, Eq. 18.7, can in
most cases adequately describe the kinetics of the
austenite to pearlite transformation. This can be
demonstrated by taking several sets of Nand Gvalues
from Fig. 18.19, which contains data from a 0.78 percent
C plain-carbon steel. This figure indicates that at
700°C, N/H110056.31/H1100310/H110024nuclei per mm3per sec and
G/H110053.16/H1100310/H110024mm per sec. On the other hand, at
550°C, N/H110051000 nuclei per mm3per sec andG/H110058.91/H1100310/H110023mm per sec. Substitute these values of
Nand Ginto Eq. 18.7, and with the aid of a computer
obtain the pearlite reaction curves for this steel at 700
and 500°C. Plot the fraction transformed, f(t),versus
log(t) as in Fig. 18.20.

19.1 CONTINUOUS COOLING TRANSFORMATIONS (CCT)
The isothermal transformation diagram is a valuable tool for studying the temperature
dependence of austenitic transformations. In even a single reaction, such as the austeniteto pearlite transformation, the product varies in appearance with the transformation tem-perature. A specimen that is allowed to transform over a range of temperatures, therefore,has a mixed microstructure that is very difﬁcult to analyze without prior information.Before the original work on isothermal transformations by Davenport and Bain,
1the basic
austenitic reactions were not clearly deﬁned and our knowledge of them was, to say theleast, confused. The time-temperature relationships that are mapped out on an isothermaltransformation diagram, however, are strictly applicable only to transformations carriedout at constant temperatures. Unfortunately, very few commercial heat treatments occurin this manner. In most cases, the metal is heated into the austenite range and then con-tinuously cooled to room temperature, with the cooling rate varying with the type of treat-ment and the size and shape of the specimen. The difference between isothermaltransformation diagrams and continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams is per-haps most easily understood by comparing these two forms for a steel of eutectoid com-position. This particular composition is chosen because of its simplicity, and the pertinentdiagrams are given in Fig. 19.1. Two cooling curves, corresponding to different rates ofcontinuous cooling, are also shown in Fig. 19.1. In each case, the cooling curves startabove the eutectoid temperature and fall in temperature with increasing times. Theinverted shape of these curves is due to plotting the time coordinate (abscissa) accordingto a logarithmic scale. On a linear time scale the curves would be concave toward the rignt,signifying a decreasing rate of cooling with increasing time.
Now consider the curve marked 1. At the end of approximately 6 s this curve crosses
the line representing the beginning of the pearlite transformation. The intersection ismarked on the diagram as point a. The signiﬁcance of point ais that it represents the
time required to nucleate pearlite isothermally at 650°C (the temperature of point a). A
specimen carried along line 1, however, only reached the 650°C isothermal at the end of6 s and may be considered to have been at temperatures above 650°C for the entire 6-sinterval. Because the time required to start the pearlite transformation is longer at temper-atures above 650°C than it is at 650°C, the continuously cooled specimen is not ready toform pearlite at the end of 6 s. Approximately, it may be assumed that cooling along path 1 to 650°C has only a slightly greater effect on the pearlite reaction than does an instan-taneous quench to this temperature. In other words, more time is needed before transfor-mation can begin. Since in continuous cooling an increase in time is associated with a dropin temperature, the point at which transformation actually starts lies to the right andbelow point a. (The location of this point may be estimated with the aid of several appro-
priate assumptions.

FIG. 19.1 The relationship of the continuous cooling diagram to the
isothermal diagram for an eutectoid steel (schematic). The dashed curves
represent isothermal transformation
it can be shown that the ﬁnish of the pearlite transformation, point d, is depressed down-
ward and to the right of point c, the point where the continuous cooling curve crosses the
line representing the ﬁnish of isothermal transformation.
The above reasoning explains qualitatively why the continuous-cooling-transformation
(CCT) lines representing the start and ﬁnish of the pearlite transformations are shifted with
respect to the corresponding isothermal-transformation lines. Why the bainite reaction in
this metal does not appear on continuous cooling also needs to be explained. This is not too
hard to understand and is related to the fact that the pearlite reaction lines extend over and
beyond the bainite-transformation lines. Thus, on slow or moderate rates of cooling (curve
1), austenite in the specimens is converted completely to pearlite before the cooling curve
reaches the bainite-transformation range. Since the austenite has already been completely
transformed, no bainite can form. Alternatively, as shown by curve 2, the specimen is in
the bainite-transformation region for too short a period of time to allow any appreciable
amount of bainite to form. An element in this latter conclusion is the fact that the
rate at which bainite forms rapidly decreases with falling temperatures. It is generally
assumed (as a ﬁrst approximation) in drawing the continuous-cooling-transformation19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 604

FIG. 19.2 The variation of microstructure as a function of cooling rate 
for an eutectoid steeldiagram for this particular alloy, that the transformation along a path such as curve 2 stops
in the region where the bainite and pearlite transformations overlap on the isothermal dia-
gram. As a result, the microstructures corresponding to path 2 should consist of a mixture
of pearlite and martensite, with perhaps a small amount of bainite, which we shall ignore.
The martensite, of course, forms from the austenite that did not transform to pearlite at
higher temperatures.
The continuous-cooling-transformation diagram of an eutectoid steel is shown again in
Fig. 19.2. A number of cooling curves are also shown on the diagram. The given curves are
not quantitative, but rather qualitative representations of how various cooling rates can
produce different microstructures. The curve marked “full anneal” represents very slow
cooling and is usually obtained by cooling specimens (suitably austenitized) in a furnace
that has its power supply shut off. This rate of cooling normally brings the steel to room
temperature in about a day. Here the transformation of the austenite takes place at temper-
atures close to the eutectoid temperature and the ﬁnal structure is, accordingly, a coarse
pearlite and close to that predicted for an equilibrium transformation. The second curve,
marked “normalizing,” represents a heat treatment in which specimens are cooled at19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 605
Chapter 19 The Hardening of Steel 606
an intermediate rate by pulling them out of the austenitizing furnace and allowing them to
cool in air. In this case, cooling is accomplished in a matter of minutes and the specimentransforms in the range of temperatures between 550°C and 600°C. The structure obtainedin this manner is again pearlite, but much ﬁner in texture than that obtained in the fullannealing treatment. The next cooling curve represents a still faster rate of cooling, such asmight be obtained when a red-hot specimen is quenched directly into a bath of oil. Coolingat this rate produces a microstructure that is a mixture of pearlite and martensite. Finally,the curve farthest to the left and marked “water quench” represents a rate of cooling sorapid that no pearlite is able to form and the structure is entirely martensitic.
In summary, CCT diagrams provide powerful road maps for predicting microstructural
development during normal or interrupted cooling conditions. As such, the diagrams canbe used to predict the mechanical properties which will result under a prescribed heattreatment process. Examples of such diagrams for various steels can be found elsewhere.
3,4
As will be discussed in the following sections, CCT diagrams depend on the alloy chem-istry and grain size of the parent austenite.
5CCT diagrams are determined, similar to the
isothermal diagrams, by conventional interrupted quenching and metallographic tech-niques,
6or by in-situ measurement of the magnetic permeability and volume change
during transformation.7The latter two techniques make use of the materials property
changes that take place when austenite transforms to pearlite, bainite, or martensite.Among these techniques, the volumetric change, which is accomplished by using adilatometer, is widely used. Computational modeling has also been employed to predictCCT diagrams.
8,9However, the modeling techniques require veriﬁcation by other exper-
imental measurements.
19.2 HARDENABILITY
Another curve is also shown in Fig. 19.2 as a dashed line—the critical-cooling-rate curve.Any rate of cooling faster than this produces a martensitic structure, while any slower rateproduces a structure containing some pearlite.
In a steel specimen of any appreciable size, the cooling rates at the surface and at the
center are not the same. The difference in these rates naturally increases with the severityof the quench, or the speed of the cooling process. Thus, there will be little difference, atany instant, between the temperature at the surface and at the center of a bar of some sizewhen it is furnace-cooled (fully annealed). On the other hand, the same bar, if quenchedin a rapid coolant such as iced brine, has markedly different cooling rates at the surfaceand at the center, which are capable of producing entirely different microstructures at thesurface and center of the bar. This effect is demonstrated in Fig. 19.3, where cooling curvesare plotted to represent paths followed by the surface and the center of a sizable bar (per-haps 2 in. in diameter) assumed to be quenched in a very rapid cooling medium. Twoother curves are also plotted on the diagram representing the critical cooling rate, and therate that gives a structure 50 percent martensite and 50 percent pearlite. It is signiﬁcantthat in the present example these two rates fall within the extremes denoted by the sur-face and the center of the bar. We may conclude that this specimen will have a structureat the surface that is martensitic, while the center will have a pearlitic structure. Thechange in the microstructure with distance along a diameter is accompanied by a corre-sponding variation in the hardness of the metal. This fact can be easily demonstrated bycutting a quenched bar in two on an abrasive cutoff wheel, while taking care to see thatthe specimen is cooled properly during the sawing so that the metal does not become19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 606

while the pearlitic structure near the center is considerably softer (Rockwell C-40). Also19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 607

plotted on the diagram is a horizontal line corresponding to the hardness of an eutectoid-
steel structure containing 50 percent martensite and 50 percent pearlite (C-54). Notice
that this intersects the hardness contour in the regions where it rises most steeply. This
means that the distance from the surface where the specimen cooled at a rate which pro-
duced 50 percent martensite is capable of rather precise experimental measurement. The
same position can also be determined by preparing the cross-section as a metallographic
specimen and observing it under the microscope. Alternatively, since the pearlite etches
darker than martensite, a macroscopic measurement of the position at which the structure
effectively changes from martensite to pearlite can be made in terms of a color change. At
any rate, the position corresponding to half-martensite and half-pearlite is easy to meas-
ure and is used as a criterion for measuring the depth to which a steel hardens with a given
type of quench.
The depth at which the 50 percent martensite structure is obtained in a bar of steel
is a function of a number of variables that include the composition and grain size of the
metal (austenitic), the severity of the quench, and the size of the bar. Let us consider
ﬁrst the effect of changing the diameter of the bar of steel. Suppose that a number of
bars of the same steel are given an identical quench in a brine solution and then
sectioned so as to obtain hardness contours. The results are shown schematically in 
Fig. 19.5. An investigation of these curves shows that there is one unique diameter, the
value of which is 1 in. The bar with this diameter hardens so that it has the 50 percent
pearlite–50 percent martensite structure just at its center. All bars with smaller diame-
ters are effectively hardened throughout, while any bar with a larger diameter has a soft
core containing pearlite. This particular diameter is called the critical diameter . Its value
depends on the steel in question and the means of quenching, and its importance lies in
the fact that it gives a measure of the ability of the steel to respond to a hardening heat
treatment. The particular steel being discussed has a moderate ability to harden, or, as it
is more properly stated, it has a moderate hardenability. According to Fig. 19.5, its
critical diameter Dis 1.0 in. The addition of suitable alloying elements to steels can greatly
increase their hardenability and this is shown by corresponding increases in their critical
diameters. The critical diameter Dof a steel is, consequently, a measure of its hardenabil-
ity (ability to harden), but it also depends on the rate of cooling (the type of quench). In
order to eliminate this latter variable, it is general practice to refer all hardenability meas-
urements to a standard cooling medium. This standard is the so-called ideal quench , which
uses a hypothetical cooling medium assumed to bring the surface of a piece of steel
instantly to the temperature of the quenching bath, and maintain it at this temperature.
The critical diameter corresponding to an ideal quench is called the ideal critical diameter
and is designated DI.

The ideal quenching medium is assumed to remove the heat from the surface as fast as
it can ﬂow out from inside of the bar. While such a quenching medium does not exist, its
cooling action on steels is capable of computation and comparison with those of ordinary
commercial quenching media, such as water, oil, and brine. Information of this type is fre-
quently presented in the form of curves such as those shown in Fig. 19.6, where the ideal
critical diameter DIis plotted as the abscissa, and the critical diameter Dis plotted as the ordi-
nate. A number of different curves are plotted on this chart, each corresponding to a differ-
ent rate of cooling. In each case, the rate of cooling is measured by a number known as its
Hvalue, or the severity of the quench. This value is also known as the Grossman number.10
Some of the values of this number for commercial quenches are given in Table 19.1. The

Number) for Some Typical Quenching Conditions.

use of the chart is easily illustrated by considering the example given above (Fig. 19.5),
where it was determined that the critical diameter D, obtained in a brine quench 
(H/H110052), was 1.0 in. The Hvalue for a brine quench with no agitation is 2.0. The inter-
section of the curve for this severity of quench with the 1.0-in. ordinate occurs at a DI
value (abscissa) 1.4. The ideal critical diameter, or hardenability of the steel in question,is D
I/H110051.4 in.
Table 19.1 shows the value of agitation during a quench. When hot metal is placed
in a liquid cooling medium, gas vapors are formed at the surface of contact between thehot metal and the liquid, which retard the heat ﬂow from metal to liquid. Agitation, ormovement of the specimen relative to the liquid, is instrumental in removing the bub-bles from the surface and increasing the rate of cooling. The fact that brine, water, andoil are better cooling agents in descending order is closely related to the removal ofvapor bubbles from the surface. The lower inherent viscosity of water allows the bub-bles to be moved faster in a water quench than in an oil quench. In a brine quench, thepresence of salt in the water causes a series of small explosions to occur near the hot sur-face and therefore violently agitates the cooling solution in the vicinity of the quenchedmaterial.
The Grossman method of determining the ideal critical diameter D
I, outlined above, is
too time consuming to be of wide practical application. It has been described as a meansof introducing the concept of hardenability and the quantity that we use to measure it,namely, D
I. A much more convenient and widely used method of determining hardenabil-
ity employs the Jominy end quench test.
In the Jominy test, a single specimen takes the place of the series of specimens
required in the Grossman method. The standard Jominy specimen consists of a cylin-drical rod 4 in. long and 1 in. in diameter. Since Jominy test specimen dimensions arefrequently speciﬁed in inches, rather than mm, the former units will be used in thissection of the text. For conversion, each inch is equal to 25.4 mm. In making a test, thespecimen is ﬁrst heated to a suitable austenitizing temperature and held there longenough to obtain a uniform austenitic structure. It is then placed in a jig and a streamof water allowed to strike one end of the specimen. The experimental equipment isshown in Fig. 19.7. The advantage of the Jominy test is that in a single specimen oneis able to obtain a range of cooling rates varying from a very rapid water quench at oneend to a slow air quench at the other end. After the complete transformation ofthe austenite in the bar, two shallow ﬂat surfaces are ground on opposite sides of thebar and a hardness-test traverse is made running from one end of the bar to the otheralong one of these prepared surfaces. The data thus obtained are plotted to give theJominy hardenability curve. A typical example is shown in Fig. 19.8, where it can beseen that the hardness is greatest where the cooling is most rapid—near the quenchedend. A great deal of effort has gone into the determination of the cooling rates expectedat various distances from the quenched end of a Jominy bar and to correlating thesedata with cooling rates inside circular bars and other shapes. Of particular importanceto our present discussion is the relationship between the size, or diameter, of a steel barquenched in an ideal quenching medium that has the same cooling rate at its center asa given position along the surface of a Jominy bar. This information is furnished inTable 19.2. The signiﬁcance of Table 19.2 is that if the position on the Jominy bar wherethe structure is half martensite is known, this table makes possible the determinationof D
I, the ideal critical diameter. For example, consider the Jominy curve in Fig. 19.8.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 610

In a 0.65 percent carbon steel, the hardness of 50 percent martensite should be HRC-52,
as may be seen in Table 19.3. This table gives the hardness of the initial structure, taken as
100 percent martensite, as well as that at a 50 percent martensitic structure, for steels of
different carbon concentrations. According to Fig. 19.8, HRC-52 lies at 3/16 in. from the
quenched end of the Jominy bar, and according to Table 19.3, the DIof the steel is 1.37 in.
This is within the experimental error of our previous value, 1.4 in. Additional details on
the use of Jominy bar tests to predict hardenability of steels can be found elsewhere.11–1319Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 611

19.3 THE VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE THE HARDENABILITY
OF A STEEL
The hardenability of a steel, which is expressed by its DI, is a function of its chemi-
cal composition and the size of the austenite grains it contains at the instant of
quenching. We shall now discuss the effect of these factors on the hardenability,but first a word should be said about the principles of changing hardenability. Ametal with a high hardenability is one in which austenite is able to transform tomartensite without forming pearlite, even when the rate of cooling is rather slow.Conversely, high rates of cooling are required to form martensite in steels of lowhardenability. In either case, the limiting factor is the rate at which pearlite forms atelevated temperatures. Any variable that moves the pearlite transformation lines tothe right in a continuous-cooling-transformation diagram, such as Fig. 19.3, makesit possible to obtain a martensite structure at a slower rate of cooling. A movementof the pearlite transformation nose to the right is thus associated with an increasein hardenability. From another viewpoint we can say that anything that slows downthe nucleation and growth of pearlite increases the hardenability of a steel.
19.4 AUSTENITIC GRAIN SIZE
When steel is heated into the austenite region in order to austenitize the metal, the low-temperature structure that is transformed to the gamma phase is, in general, an aggre-gate of cementite and ferrite (that is, pearlite, or decomposed martensite). In thisreversed transformation, the austenite grains form by nucleation and growth; the nucleiform heterogeneously at cementite-ferrite interfaces. Because of the large interfacialarea available for nucleation, the number of austenite grains that appear is usuallylarge. The transformation of steel upon heating is, therefore, characterized initially by asmall austenitic grain size. However, in the austenite range, thermal movements ofthe atoms are rapid enough to cause grain growth, so that extended times and high tem-peratures in the austenite range are capable of greatly increasing the size of the initialaustenite grains.
The size of the austenite grain that is attained before a metal is cooled back to
room temperature is important in determining a number of the physical propertiesof the final structure, including the hardening response of the steel. Before describ-ing this latter effect, let us explain the most commonly accepted method of desig-nating the austenitic grain size. The ASTM grain-size number is defined by therelationship
n/H110052N/H11002119.1
where nis the number of grains per square inch as seen in a specimen viewed at a magni-
ﬁcation of 100 times, and Nis the ASTM grain-size number. The usual range of austenitic
grain sizes in steels lies between 1 and 9. The number of grains per square inch in this inter-val is given in Table 19.4. Notice that as the grains get smaller (more numerous), the grain-size number increases.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 614

19.5 THE EFFECT OF AUSTENITIC GRAIN SIZE 
ON HARDENABILITY
The effect of grain size on hardenability has been explained2on the basis of the heteroge-
neous manner in which pearlite nucleates at austenitic grain boundaries. While the rate
of growth Gof pearlite is independent of the austenite grain size, the total number of
nuclei that form per second varies directly with the surface available for their formation.Thus, in a ﬁne-grain steel, ASTM No. 7, there is four times as much grain-boundary areaas in coarse-grain steel of grain size No. 3. The formation of pearlite in the ﬁne-grain steelis, therefore, more rapid than it is in the coarse-grain steel and, accordingly, the ﬁne-grainsteel has a lower hardenability.
The use of a coarse austenitic grain size in order to increase the hardenability of steel
is not generally practiced. The desired increase in hardenability is accompanied by unde-sirable changes in other properties, such as an increase in brittleness and a loss of ductil-ity. Quench cracks, or cracking of the steel due to thermal shock and the stresses incidentto the quenching operation, are also more common in large-grain specimens.
19.6 THE INFLUENCE OF CARBON CONTENT 
ON HARDENABILITY
The hardenability of a steel is strongly inﬂuenced by its carbon content. This fact is shownin Fig. 19.9, where the variation of the ideal critical diameter D
Iwith carbon content is plot-
ted for three different grain sizes. In addition to showing that the hardenability increaseswith increasing carbon content, these curves demonstrate the very low hardenability ofsimple iron-carbon alloys. For example, an eutectoid steel with about 0.8 percent C and asmall grain size (No. 8) possesses an ideal diameter 7.1 mm (0.28 in.). This means that themaximum theoretical diameter of a steel bar of this relatively high-carbon content that canbe hardened to its center (in an ideal quench) is about 6.9 mm ( in.). Any ordinaryquench will, accordingly, not harden even this size bar to its center. Fortunately, so-called commercial carbon steels always contain some manganese and sometimes smallamounts of other elements that increase their hardenability. The manganese in thesesteels is required in order that they can be manufactured economically. In this respect,
1
419Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 615
Chapter 19 The Hardening of Steel 616
the isothermal diagrams previously described were for steels containing manganese. The
hardenabilities of the latter are considerably higher than if simple iron-carbon alloys had
been considered.
Because increasing carbon content is associated with an increase in hardenability, it
is evident that the formation of pearlite and proeutectoid constituents becomes more
difﬁcult the higher the carbon content of the steel. This statement is true not only for
hypoeutectoid steels, but also for those with carbon contents greater than the eutectoid
composition (hypereutectoid steels), provided that each steel is completely transformed
to austenite before its hardenability is measured. It frequently happens in practice that
hypereutectoid steels are austenitized in the two-phase cementite plus austenite region.
When this happens, nearly all of the structure becomes austenitic, but a small amount
of cementite is stable and does not dissolve. On cooling, the residual carbide particles
encourage pearlite nucleation, resulting in lowered hardenability.
19.7 THE INFLUENCE OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS 
ON HARDENABILITY
Each and every one of the chemical elements in a steel has an inﬂuence on its hardenabil-
ity. The degree, of course, varies with the element in question. Of the common alloying
elements added to steel, cobalt is the only one known to decrease hardenability. The pres-
ence of cobalt in steel increases both the rate of nucleation and the rate of growth of
pearlite,14and steels containing this element are more difﬁcult to harden than those that
do not contain it.
Other common alloying elements, to the extent that they are soluble in iron, increase
the hardenability of steels. There are a number of ways that this effect can be demon-
strated. One of the simplest is by empirical hardenability multiplying factors. These useful
parameters were ﬁrst introduced by Grossman.15They make possible a ﬁrst-order approxi-
mation of the hardenability of a steel when only its chemical composition and its austenite
grain size are known. A short list of these factors is given in Table 19.5. In this table, col-

austenitic grain size 7. The ASTM table of the Grossman multiplying factors only consid-
ers this austenitic grain size on the basis that most commercial steels, designed for aquench and temper heat treatment, are produced with approximately this grain size. Itshould also be noted that in this table, the carbon concentration factors are different(smaller) for carbon concentrations below 0.35 percent C than they were in earlier multi-plication factor tables. These reﬁnements are based on analyses of experimental data fromthousands of heats of steel. A word should be said at this point about the difﬁculty that hasbeen encountered in determining the carbon multiplying factors when the carbon concen-tration is below about 0.3 percent.
16These factors are normally determined using iron-
carbon specimens of high purity. In these steels, the hardenability is very low, whichrequires that the specimens have small cross-sections in order to develop martensitic struc-tures. At the same time, there is a very critical dependence of the microstructure on thecooling rate in these low hardenability steels. A signiﬁcant factor also has to be that someof the carbon in the specimens may precipitate to dislocations during the quench, thuslowering the hardness of the martensite.
Another important feature of the ASTM Standard A255 is that it gives a procedure
which allows the boron concentration of a steel to be included in the determinationof the ideal critical diameter D
I. Boron is an element that can produce a signiﬁcant
increase in hardenability when added to a fully deoxidized steel. Even as small anamount of boron as 0.001 percent can have as strong effect on the hardenability. Its19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 617
Chapter 19 The Hardening of Steel 618
greatest effect is noticed in low-carbon steels. High-carbon steels show a smaller
response. The subject of boron will not be considered further here; for further informa-tion, consult ASTM A255.
17
As an example of the computation of the ideal critical diameter, DI, using the
Grossman multiplication factors, consider a steel with a carbon content of 0.40 and anaustenitic grain size 7. Table 19.5 indicates that for this carbon concentration the carbonmultiplying factor, or the base diameter , is:
DI/H110050.213 19.2
Suppose now that the steel in question conforms to that classiﬁed as an AISI 8640
steel in the American Iron and Steel Institute’s system. In this case its composition limitsshould fall within the following bounds:
carbon 0.38 to 0.43 percent
manganese 0.75 to 1.00 percentsilicon 0.20 to 0.35 percentnickel 0.40 to 0.70 percentchromium 0.40 to 0.60 percent
molybdenum 0.15 to 0.25 percent
Let us also assume, for the purpose of a simple illustrative calculation, that the steel
under consideration contains 0.40 percent carbon and the maximum concentration of all the
other indicated elements. The next step is to ﬁnd the value of the multiplying factor for eachelement. This is done in the same manner as is used for ﬁnding the base diameter. Thus,opposite 1.00 percent as read in the percent column, there appers in the manganese columnthe ﬁgure 4.333. The base diameter is multiplied by this factor to give the hardenability ofthe steel as determined by its austenitic grain size, its carbon content, and its manganese con-tent. In the same manner we ﬁnd that the multiplying factors for the other elements are
Percentage of Element Multiplying Factor
1.00% Mn 4.333
0.35% Si 1.2450.70% Ni 1.2550.60% Cr 2.296
0.25% Mo 1.75
The total hardenability of the steel in question is obtained by multiplying the base
diameter by every one of these factors, or
DI/H110050.213 /H110034.333 /H110031.245 /H110031.255 /H110032.296 /H110031.7519.3

The signiﬁcance of the above numerical value is worth considering. The addition of a total
amount of alloying elements equal to less than 3 percent produces a steel with an ideal19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 618

www.asminternational.org)critical diameter of 5.79 in. Even in a poor water quench ( H/H110051.0), a steel of this harden-
ability should have a critical diameter of about 5 in. An ordinary carbon steel of the same car-
bon content (C AISI 1040) contains manganese in the limits 0.60 to 0.90 percent Mn as the
only basic alloying element, assuming the maximum manganese content DIis 0.8 in. and the 
D(critical diameter) for a poor water quench ( H/H110051.0) is less than in. The importance of
the alloying elements in low-alloy steels in developing the hardenability is quite apparent.
Refer again to the allowable compositional limits in the low-alloy steel discussed above.
It is interesting to compute its hardenability in terms of the minimum compositional limits
rather than the maximum values. When this is done, one obtains a DIof 2.63 in. It is clear
that the hardenability of commercial steels varies within rather wide limits, corresponding
to the compositional variations dictated by the problems of manufacture.
The fact that different alloying elements have greatly different effects on hardenabil-
ity is clearly indicated in Table 19.5. An element that has no effect would have a multi-
plying factor of unity. For the elements listed in the table, nickel shows the least effect
and manganese the greatest. Phosphorus and sulfur, which occur in steels as impurities,
are generally considered to have factors of unity.
The hardenability of alloy steels is also visible in isothermal-transformation diagrams.
As an example, consider the steel designated AISI 4340. The isothermal transformation dia-
gram for this steel is shown in Fig. 19.10. The hardenability of this steel, for the composition1

of this steel is that the pearlite and bainite transformations both exhibit noses. At the upper
nose, the diagram shows that the minimum time required to form a visible amount of proeu-
tectoid ferrite is about 200 s (650°C), and just below this temperature the minimum time to
form pearlite is somewhat more than 1800 s (30 min). In the same manner, the minimum
time for the formation of a visible amount of bainite is slightly over 10 s at 450°C. This trans-
formation diagram should be compared with those for plain-carbon steels given earlier 
(Figs. 18.30, 18.37, and 18.38 in Chapter 18). The difference in the rapidity with which the
transformations occur is quite evident.
The continuous cooling transformation for the AISI 4340 steel is shown in Fig. 19.11.
It is apparent in the ﬁgure that any cooling rate that brings the steel to room temperature
in less than 90 s produces a martensitic structure. The effect of the high hardenability is
also clearly shown in the corresponding Jominy curve for this steel, which is shown in
Fig. 19.12. At a distance greater than 2 in. from the quenched end of the bar the struc-
ture is still 95 percent martensite.
The isothermal diagram of Fig. 19.10 is characteristic of those steels in which bainite
can be obtained during continuous cooling. In the diagram for a plain carbon steel consid-
ered earlier, measurable amounts of bainite do not form on continuous cooling because
the pearlite transformation region extends over the corresponding bainite region. In the19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 620

19.8 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HARDENABILITY
Is high hardenability desirable in a steel? The answer is that it is not always desirable. This
is especially true when steels are to be welded. Steels containing any appreciable amount
of added elements are notoriously difﬁcult to weld successfully. In making a weld, two
pieces of steel are joined by casting a section of molten metal between them. This opera-
tion naturally heats the metal adjacent to the weld and, for some distance to each side of
the weld center, steel is raised into the austenitic region. If the hardenability of the metal
is high, hard brittle martensite may form on cooling to room temperature. This is accen-
tuated by the quenching effect of the cold steel surrounding the heat-affected zone, for
heat ﬂows rapidly from the heated region into the surrounding metal. Because of the
above considerations, structural steels, intended for construction of bridges, buildings,
and ships, are usually designed to have moderate hardenabilities.
High hardenabilities are desirable in steels that are to be hardened as one of the ﬁnal
steps in their manufacture. It is generally believed that the best combination of physical
properties (strength plus ductility) is obtained if the metal is transformed completely to
martensite during the hardening treatment. In some cases, if the Mftemperature is below
room temperature, this may require that the metal be cooled to subzero temperature in
order to remove most of the residual austenite. However, the primary requirement for
obtaining a martensitic structure in a given steel object is that the steel have a sufﬁciently
high hardenability to harden under the required quenching conditions. Unfortunately,
hardenability is associated with alloying elements in the steel, whose presence raises its
cost. As a result, the basic problem is economic and requires the avoidance of the use of
steel with too high a hardenability (and too high a cost) for the job at hand. An important
factor in determining the required hardenability is the speed of quench that must be used.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 621

ing rates are also associated with severe thermal shocks. These can cause quench cracks
and warping of the ﬁnished object, leading to its rejection. Thus, in commercial practice,
oil and even air quenches are commonly used in order to reduce damage to steel parts
caused by the more rapid quenching processes. The added cost of the high-hardenability
steel in these cases is justiﬁed by the savings in the number of parts rejected.
19.9 THE MARTENSITE TRANSFORMATION IN STEEL
The martensitic structure in steels, in the ideal case, is a simple phase that marks it from the
aggregates of ferrite and carbides, which we call pearlite and bainite. The martensitic crys-
tal structure is body-centered tetragonal and can be assumed to be an intermediate struc-
ture between the normal phases of iron—face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic. The
relationship between the three structures has already been discussed in Chapter 17. The
Bain distortion in steel is shown in Fig. 19.13. In these drawings, the positions that carbon
atoms occupy are shown by black dots. It must be recognized, however, that actually in any
given steel specimen only a very small percentage of the possible positions are ever ﬁlled.
In the face-centered cubic structure there are as many possible positions for carbon atoms
as there are iron atoms. This means that if all positions were ﬁlled, the alloy would have a
composition containing 50 atomic percent carbon. The maximum actually observed is 
9.1 atomic percent (2.11 weight percent). Figure 19.13A represents face-centered cubic
austenite. In this structure, the carbon atoms occupy the midpoints of cube edges and the
cube centers. These are equivalent positions, for in each case a carbon atom ﬁnds itself
located between two iron atoms along a /H20855001/H20856direction. The equivalent positions in the
austenite, when it is considered a body-centered tetragonal structure, are shown in

c-axis edges and in the centers of the square faces at each end of the prismatic cell. Finally,
the martensitic structure is shown in Fig. 19.13C. In this last case, the tetragonality of the
cell is greatly reduced, but the carbon atoms are still in the same relative positions with19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 622

tetragonal only because carbon atoms are inherited from the austenite, and the transforma-
tion, which would normally proceed to body-centered cubic, is not able to go to comple-
tion. The carbon atoms can be considered to strain the lattice into the tetragonal
conﬁguration, and the extent of the tetragonality that occurs may be deduced from
Fig. 19.14. Notice that the lattice parameters are plotted as a function of carbon content in
both austenite and martensite, and, in each case, the parameters vary linearly with carbon
content. In martensite with increasing carbon content the c-axis parameter increases, while
the parameter associated with the two aaxes decreases. At the same time, the cubic param-
eter of austenite ( a0) increases with increasing carbon content. These relationships may be
expressed in terms of simple equations where xis the carbon concentration.

A simple computation of the c/aratio at 1.0 percent carbon yields 1.045. This number
should be compared to the corresponding ratio when face-centered cubic austenite is
considered as a tetragonal lattice. As mentioned previously, this ratio is 1.414, so that in19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 623
Chapter 19 The Hardening of Steel 624
most steels (less than 1.00 percent C), the martensitic lattice is certainly much closer to
body-centered cubic than to face-centered cubic.
The lattice parameter curves of Fig. 19.14 show that the tetragonality of martensite
varies with the carbon content. This should have a bearing on the crystallographic char-acteristic of the transformations. With reference to the Wechsler, Lieberman, and Readtheory of martensite formation, a change in tetragonality of the product phase means adifference in magnitude of the Bain distortion. This, in turn, implies a difference in thesize of the required shear and rotation. As a result, it might be expected that both thehabit plane and the orientation relationship between the parent and product should varywith carbon content. This is actually observed, as may be seen in Table 19.6.
The best data in Table 19.6 relates to the concentration range between 0.5 and 1.4 per-
cent C, which fortunately includes almost all of the commercially important carbon steelsthat are hardened to martensite. In this range of carbon contents, the habit plane of themartensite plates is very close to a {225} plane in the austenite. Since there are twelve {225}planes and two possible twin-related orientations of the martensite for each habit plane,there are 24 possible ways that an austenite crystal can form a martensite plate. The corre-sponding orientation relationship between the lattices in the martensite and in the austen-ite of these steels is known as the Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship . It states that the (101) plane
of the martensite is parallel to the (111) plane of the parent austenite, and, at the same time,the [11 ] direction in the martensite is parallel to the [1 0] direction of the austenite.
The martensite plates that form in the middle carbon region of steels are quite similar
in appearance to those that occur in iron-nickel alloys. They are, accordingly, small in sizeand lenticular in shape. The martensitic transformation in iron-carbon alloys is primarilyathermal. However, small amounts of austenite may be transformed to martensite isother-mally. A typical curve showing the formation of athermal martensite as a function of tem-perature is shown in Fig. 19.15. The similarity of this curve to that for the formation ofmartensite on cooling given for other alloys in Chapter 17 is apparent. However, oneimportant difference should be observed. There is no curve given for the reverse transfor-mation. The reason for this is quite simple: the martensitic reaction in steels is notreversible. Iron-carbon martensite represents an extremely unstable structure with a highfree energy relative to the more stable phases—cementite and ferrite. The entrapment ofcarbon atoms in what should be a body-centered cubic structure, capable of holding atequilibrium an inﬁnitesimal amount of carbon, produces a lattice with a high internalstrain. Even moderate reheating promotes its decomposition. The study of the phenom-ena of martensite decomposition will be considered in the section entitled “Tempering.”
Both the M
s(martensite start) and Mf(martensite ﬁnish) temperatures in steel are func-
tions of the carbon content, as shown in Fig. 19.16. The Mftemperature, however, is usually1 1

not clearly deﬁned. By this it is meant that the martensite reaction can never be theoreti-
cally complete even at absolute zero temperature. The transformation of the last traces of
austenite becomes more and more difﬁcult the smaller the total amount of austenite remain-
ing. Curves such as the Mfline shown in Fig. 19.16 are based on visual estimations of the
structures of metallographic specimens and small amounts of retained austenite are very
difﬁcult to measure in a structure composed of many small overlapping martensite plates.
The Mftemperature shown in Fig. 19.16 should thus be interpreted as the temperature at
which the reaction is completed as far as one can determine by visual means. One technique
for the measurement of retained austenite in quenched steels involves quantitative X-ray
diffraction measurements and is capable of measuring retained austenite in amounts as small
as 0.3 percent. This method has been used to determine the amount of retained austenite in
carbon steels quenched to room temperature. The results are shown in the curve at the bot-
tom of Fig. 19.17. This diagram also includes a plot of the Mstemperature versus carbon con-
centration as well as one showing the volume fraction of the low temperature form of
martensite, lath martensite, with carbon concentration. A corresponding curve showing the
variation of the volume fraction of the high temperature form, lenticular or twinned
martensite, with carbon concentration appears in Fig. 19.22. Notice in Fig. 19.17 that the
martensite ﬁnish temperature, Mf, occurs at room temperature (20°C) near 0.6 percent C.
The amount of retained austenite under these conditions is over 3 percent.
Substitutional alloying elements in steels also affect the martensitic transformation.
This may be reﬂected in the habit plane indices and the orientation relationships between
the martensite and the parent austenite. Unfortunately, there is very little data available on
these effects. The inﬂuence of alloying elements on the Mstemperature is much more eas-
ily recognized and measured.21,22As a typical example, consider the addition of manganese
to steels containing carbon where a very decided lowering of the Mstemperature occurs.
This is shown in Fig. 19.18. One of the interesting features of this set of curves is the very
rapid decline of the Mstemperature with increasing manganese content in steels that also
contain 1.0 percent carbon. For those compositions containing more than 6 percent man-
ganese, the Msis so far below room temperature that we can assume that a quench to roomMs

temperature produces a structure that remains austenitic indeﬁnitely at room temperature.
The famous Hadﬁeld manganese steel (10–14 percent Mn and 1–1.4 percent C) takes
advantage of this fact to produce a steel with an austenitic structure that work hardens very
rapidly and has an initial very high strength due to the presence of the manganese and
carbon in solid solution. This combination of properties makes for a very tough, hard,
abrasion-resistant metal. A typical application is in the buckets and teeth of power shovels.
The effect of other solid-solution elements on the Mstemperature varies with the ele-
ment concerned. Manganese has the strongest effect followed by chromium. All common
alloying elements (substitutional) lower the Mstemperature, except for cobalt and alu-
minum, which raise it.0–1000100200300

www.asminternational.org)it has become the practice to designate this type of hardness number by the symbol HV or
hardness Vickers. On the right-hand ordinate axis the corresponding Rockwell-C hardness
numbers are also given. Note that at lower carbon concentrations, the data from all sources
are in reasonable agreement. However, above 0.6 percent carbon an appreciable scatter
occurs in the data. Above this concentration the martensite ﬁnish temperature falls below
room temperature. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the high carbon scatter of the
data may be associated with differing amounts of retained austenite resulting from a differ-
ence in the quenching rates used by the various authors of the data in Fig. 19.19. If this is
true, then the upper bound of the data should be more representative of the hardness of
the martensite. Note that this boundary tends to rise continuously with increasing carbon
concentration. A schematic diagram consistent with Fig. 19.19 but that eliminates the data
points is shown in Fig. 19.20. Finally, the effect that retained austenite can have on the
hardness of very high carbon steels is clearly shown in Fig. 19.21. This plot shows that for
carbon concentrations in excess of 1.0 percent, the hardness of carbon steels, brine-
quenched to room temperature, falls continuously with increasing carbon concentration.
This is the result of a corresponding increase in the amount of retained austenite. In sup-
port of this assumption, as may be seen in Fig. 19.16, the Mstemperature approaches room
temperature for carbon concentrations above 1.4 percent.
The hardness of martensite results from the presence of carbon in the steel. In this
respect, it is signiﬁcant that the martensite product in alloys other than steels are not neces-
sarily hard. It is also evident from Fig. 19.19 that an appreciable amount of carbon (about
0.4 percent) is needed in steel to cause a marked degree of hardening. In order to obtain a
truly hardened steel, the two required factors are: ﬁrst, an adequate carbon concentration in
the metal, and second, rapid cooling to produce a martensitic structure.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 628
629 19.10 The Hardness of Iron-Carbon Martensite
Experimental work based on transmission electron microscopy has clearly shown
that the martensite in carbon steels can form by two reactions. One gives a structure
known as lath martensite ; the other is a lenticular martensite that is internally twinned. The
primary factor controlling the relative volume fractions of these two forms is apparently
the transformation temperature. A lower transformation temperature favors a higher
concentration of the twinned lenticular martensite. Since increasing the carbon concen-
tration generally lowers the Mstemperature, higher carbon steels tend to have large vol-
ume fractions of the twinned component. This is demonstrated in Fig. 19.22. On the
other hand, in low-carbon steels the martensite is primarily of the lath type.
The lath martensite is characterized by a high internal dislocation density of the order
of 1015to 1016m/H110022. These dislocations are arranged in plate-shaped cells. On the other
hand, the twinned martensite normally does not contain a high density of dislocations. The
observed two basic forms of martensite are consistent with an assumption that in the lath
martensite the macroscopic shear is accomplished by slip, while in the lenticular martensite
it occurs by twinning (see Figs. 17.30 and 17.31). The difference in the defect concentration
between the two martensite forms has an important bearing on the respective distribution
of the carbon atoms inside them. In lath martensite, the carbon atoms tend to diffuse and
segregate around the dislocations. Even in a very rapid quench there is ample time for this19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 629

density of dislocations, the carbon atoms are forced to occupy normal interstitial sites.
As may be seen in Fig. 19.19, the hardness of martensite for pure iron is about 200 HV.
An annealed pure iron has a hardness of the order of 100 HV. The high hardness of
martensitic pure iron is caused by the substructural strengthening effect of the ﬁnely
spaced cell walls and lath boundaries in the lath martensite. In effect, this is attributing the
hardness to the high dislocation density in this structure.
In iron containing carbon there is additional hardening due to the carbon. In this case
the carbon is believed to increase the hardness through its interaction with the dislocations.
This can occur by segregation of the dislocations in the cell walls and by solid-solution
strengthening. With regard to this latter effect, the martensitic transformation can be
viewed23as trapping an abnormally high concentration of carbon atoms in solid solution,
thereby producing a large hardening component.
A very important practical fact about the hardness of martensite in steels is that in all
of the so-called low-alloy steels (less than about 5 percent total alloying elements) the hard-
ness of martensite can be assumed to depend only on the carbon concentration of the
metal. Consequently, if the carbon content of any low-alloy steel is known, the approxi-
mate hardness of the steel when it has a martensitic structure can be determined (with the
aid of a curve such as Fig. 19.20).
The hardness of a steel containing some ﬁxed fraction of martensite, say 50 percent,
is also approximately a function of only its carbon content. In this respect, Fig. 19.23

WITH TRANSFORMATION OF MARTENSITE
When austenite transforms to martensite, there is a change in volume that can be com-puted by considering the Bain distortion and the lattice parameters of austentite andmartensite.

and the relative change in volume, assuming martensite to form from austenite at room
temperature, is
When a 1 percent carbon steel transforms to martensite, there is a volume increase of about
4.0 percent that can be considered to be an average value, representative of steels in gen-eral, that does not vary widely with the carbon content. This is because we are transform-ing from austenite with a c/aratio of 1.414 to martensite with c/aratios lying between
1.0 and 1.090, corresponding to the maximum range of carbon contents (0 to 2 percent C).
Because of the many orientations that martensite plates can take in a single austenite
crystal, it can be assumed that the volume expansion is isotropic in a specimen of sufﬁcientsize. Length changes may, accordingly, be used to measure the deformation associated withthe martensitic reaction. In this respect, as is shown in calculus, a small isotropic lengthchange is approximately equal to one-third the corresponding volume change. Therefore,

FIG. 19.24 Schematic tangential stress pattern in
a quenched cylinder when the surface is left in a
state of tension and the center in compression19.12 QUENCH CRACKS
When a piece of steel is cooled in such a way as to form martensite, two basic dimensional
changes occur. First, there is the normal thermal contraction due to cooling, but superim-
posed on this is the expansion of the metal as it transforms from austenite to martensite.
Under the right conditions, these volumetric changes can produce very high internal
stresses. If these stresses become large enough, they can produce plastic deformation and
the steel will be deformed or warped. While plastic deformation tends to reduce the sever-
ity of the quenching stresses, the degree to which this is accomplished depends on a num-
ber of factors, and it is quite possible to have large enough residual stresses remaining in
the metal to actually cause rupture. These localized fractures are called quench cracks .
The approximate nature of the residual stress pattern that develops in an actual steel
shape on quenching to martensite will now be considered. For this purpose, steel specimens
in the form of round cylinders will be considered. When quenched, the surface always cools
faster than the center and undergoes the martensitic transformation ﬁrst, which hardens 
the surface relative to the center. Supplementing this hardening is the fact that the yield
strength, or plastic ﬂow stress of the metal, increases with decreasing temperature. Now,
whether or not the surface will be set in tension relative to the center of the bar depends on
the sign of the net volumetric change that occurs in the interior of the bar after the surface
has hardened. If the expansion in this region, due to the martensitic transformation, is larger
than the remaining thermal contraction, the surface will attain a residual state of tension.
The center will, of course, remain in a state of compression and the nature of this stress pat-
tern is implied in Fig. 19.24. The reversed stress pattern, in which the surface ends in a state
of residual compressive stress and the center in a state of tensile stress, occurs when the ther-
mal contraction in the center of the bar subsequent to the hardening of the surface exceeds
the martensitic expansion. Which of these two basic stress distributions eventuates depends
on the relative cooling rates at the surface and at the center of the bar. This, of course, is a
function of both the size of the bar and the speed of the quench. When the product of these
two variables is large (large diameter and fast cooling), the surface hardens although the
center is still at a very high temperature. The magnitude of the thermal contraction in this
case is large and determines the sign of the volume change in the central regions of the bar.
In other words, thermal contraction usually exceeds the expansion of the martensite trans-
formation. When the difference between the cooling rates at the surface and center are only
moderate, the center is at a temperature only slightly above the surface when the latter
hardens. The thermal contraction in the central areas subsequent to the hardening of the
surface is then smaller than the expansion due to the formation of martensite.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 632
633 19.13 Tempering
Several factors help to determine the magnitudes of the residual stresses.24,25It should
be noted that residual stresses can be transient (developing during cooling) or locked-in
stresses remaining within the body.26It was shown in the previous section that the expan-
sion that occurs when steel transforms to martensite at room temperature involves a dilationof about 1.3 percent. Actually, during a quench, austenite does not transform completely tomartensite at room temperature, but over a range of temperatures starting at the M
stemper-
ature. It is also true that the higher the temperature at which the transformation occurs, theless the expansion due to the formation of martensite. This follows from a correspondingchange in the austenite and martensite lattice parameters. In steels in which the M
stemper-
ature is high, the speciﬁc-volume changes are smaller and, as a consequence, there is areduced tendency to form quench cracks. High-carbon steels and those containing alloyingelements that lower M
sare, conversely, more subject to quench cracking. In addition to low-
ering Ms, high-carbon contents also increase the danger of cracking because of the increased
hardness or brittleness that high-carbon concentrations impart to the steel.
The length of time that a steel is maintained at temperatures of the order of room tem-
perature to 100°C after quenching also has an effect on the formation of quench cracks:the longer the time, the more liable the formation of cracks. Several different explanationsof this phenomenon have been offered. One of the most attractive is related to the isother-mal transformation of retained austenite to martensite. The formation of isothermalmartensite adds an additional volumetric strain to an already badly strained metal, therebyincreasing the probability of crack formation, distortion, or deformation.
19.13 TEMPERING
Steels that have undergone a simple hardening quench are usually mixtures of austeniteand martensite, with the latter constituent predominating. Both of these structures areunstable and slowly decompose, at least in part, if left at room temperature; the retainedaustenite transforms to martensite and the martensite undergoes a reaction that will bedescribed shortly. Since speciﬁc-volume changes are connected with both reactions, hard-ened steel objects undergo dimensional changes as a function of time when left at roomtemperature. Of more general importance is the fact that a structure that is almost com-pletely martensite is extremely brittle and is also very liable to develop quench cracks if agedat room temperature. These factors lead to the conclusion that steels with a simple marten-sitic structure are of little useful value, and a simple heat treatment called tempering is almost
always used to improve the physical properties of quenched steels. In this treatment, thetemperature of the steel is raised to a value below the eutectoid temperature and held therefor a ﬁxed length of time, after which the steel is cooled again to room temperature. Theobvious intent of tempering is to allow diffusion processes time to produce both a dimen-sionally more stable structure and one that is inherently less brittle.
A number of basic phenomena that occur during the decomposition of martensite
have been identiﬁed. These are as listed next
27and tend to occur in the order presented.
However, many of the phenomena tend to overlap to some degree.

between room temperature and 100°C. There are several ways that this redistri-bution may occur:(i) A segregation of the carbon atoms to lattice defects such as dislocations and
twin boundaries.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 633

(b) The precipitation of a transition carbide or carbides. The most generally identi-
ﬁed transition carbide is epsilon, /H9255, carbide. However, in many cases this carbide
is not well resolved and it is sometimes referred to as ( /H9255/h) carbide , that is, epsilon
or eta carbide. The primary difference is that epsilon carbide is hcp and eta car-
bide is orthorhombic. (See Table 19.7.) The precipitation of the transition carbideleaves a matrix of iron still containing the carbon atoms that were segregated tothe dislocations.

This structure has often been called bainite or secondary bainite .

shaped cementite particles.

(f) Recovery of the ferrite structure.(g) Recrystallization of the ferrite structure.(h) Ostwald ripening of the cementite. In this process, the larger cementite particles
grow at the expense of the smaller particles. This further reduces the surfaceenergy and is accomplished by the diffusion of carbon atoms through the ironmatrix.
Classically, it has been the custom to talk about the three stages of tempering. The ﬁrst
stage was the precipitation of the transition carbide. It is, thus, the same as (b) in the abovecompilation of phenomena. The second stage was the decomposition of the retainedaustenite, that is, (c) above. Finally, the third stage corresponded to the formation ofcementite, (d) above. The difﬁculty of the three stages of tempering classiﬁcation is that astime goes on, additional stages are discovered. Because of this, various authors have19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 634
635 19.13 Tempering
tended to use stage notations not consistent with the original three-stage concept. This
should be recognized when reading papers on the subject of tempering.
To fully grasp the subject of the tempering of martensite, it must be remembered 
that there are two basically different forms of martensite: the lath martensite that formsprimarily in low-carbon steels and the lenticular martensite that is the primary form inhigh-carbon steels. As may be seen in Fig. 19.17, the lath martensite is the dominant mor-phological feature in steels with less than about 0.5 percent C. By Fig. 19.23, the lenticu-lar martensite dominates above 0.9 percent C. In the intermediate range between 0.5 and0.9 percent C one ﬁnds mixed structures containing ﬁnite fractions of both types ofmartensite. Because of differences associated with the tempering of the high- and low-carbon containing martensites, it is perhaps best to consider the tempering of high-carbonand low-carbon steels separately. With this in mind, we shall ﬁrst consider the temperingof a high purity, high-carbon steel containing 1.13 percent carbon. A recent compre-hensive analysis of the tempering of such a steel has been made.
30As may be seen
in Fig. 19.16, the Mftemperature of this steel lies well below room temperature.
Consequently, it was observed that brine quenching of this steel to room temperaturefrom a temperature (842°C) in the austenite range resulted in a structure containing 15percent of retained austenite. However, a subsequent quench into liquid nitrogen (77 Kor/H11002196°C) reduced the volume fraction of retained austenite to 6 percent. The data that
will now be considered comes from specimens which were given the double (brine andliquid nitrogen) quenching treatment. The tempering reactions were studied in thesespecimens using both calorimetric and dilatometric (change in length) measurements.These were supplemented by microhardness measurements. A differential scanningcalorimeter (DSC) was used to obtain the thermal data and a thermal mechanical ana-lyzer was used in obtaining the change in length data. Recent improvement
30,31in these
instruments has made them valuable for the study of the kinetics of tempering reactionsunder isochronal conditions; that is, where the specimens are annealed (heated) at a con-stant rate. This type of annealing is also known as non-isothermal annealing . It should also 
be mentioned that the non-isothermal investigations were supplemented by someisothermal experiments.
Figure 19.25 shows the isochronal dilation curve obtained using a double quenched
specimen heated from /H11002196°C (77 K), the temperature of liquid nitrogen, to 450°C at a
rate of 10°C/min. In considering this curve, it should be noted that the normal thermalexpansion of the steel, in the absence of a tempering thermal reaction, gives a nearly linearcurve that rises steeply as the temperature is increased. That part of the curve shown inFig. 19.25 between the regions marked Stage 1 and Stage 2 represents a temperature inter-val in which there is no apparent tempering reaction and thus, its slope is due only to thenormal thermal expansion of the steel specimen. Deviations from this slope such as occurin the 5 temperature intervals designated as Stages 1 to 5, represent regions in which thespecimen also underwent length changes due to martensitic tempering reactions. The slopeof the experimental curve in these regions is accordingly determined by both the thermalexpansion of the specimen and the changes in length associated with the thermal reactions.As may be seen in Fig. 19.25, the slope in Stage 1 is steeper than that due to thermal expan-sion alone. The tempering reaction in this region causes an expansion of the specimen. Itwas concluded that this expansion was due to the transformation of a part of the austenitethat was retained as a result of the double quench to /H11002196°C. It can also be concluded from
Fig. 19.25 that relatively large contractions occurred in Stages 2, 3, and 5.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 635
Chapter 19 The Hardening of Steel 636
A corresponding differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve for a double quenched
1.13 percent carbon steel is shown in Fig. 19.26. In this case, a similar fully tempered
specimen was heated at a rate of 20°C/min, along with the doubly quenched martensitic
specimen, and the difference in temperature between the two specimens was recorded.
This temperature difference was then plotted against the temperature. In an experiment
of this type, the heat released in the martensitic specimen as it undergoes a tempering
reaction causes a temperature difference between the two specimens. The undulating
solid line in Fig. 19.26 represents the temperature difference between the specimens,
while the dashed lines below it show that the experimental curve is resolvable into a set
of peaks representing stages of tempering. Four of these stages correlate well with those
of the dialametric curve in Fig. 19.25. Since the data in Fig. 19.26 covered only the inter-
val between room temperature and 450°C, Stage 1 was not represented. An additional
peak, marked Stage Xin the ﬁgure, was observed. The basis for this peak will be discussed
presently.
Activation energies associated with the various tempering processes were deduced in
terms of the dependence of the data pertaining to the stages upon the rate of heating. This–200 –100 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28

papers.32,33As a result of an analysis of all the dilatometric, calorimetric, and hardness data
obtained both isochronally and isothermally, the information displayed in Table 19.8 was19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 637

deduced. Note that in this table, Stage Xin Fig. 19.27 is suggested as being possibly due to
the precipitation of the Haggs carbide. This would indicate the formation of an additional
type of transition carbide that appears in a temperature interval different from that in
which the ( /H9255/h) carbide precipitates.
Finally, with regard to this study of the tempering phenomena in a high-carbon
steel, consider Fig. 19.27, which shows the hardness of the double quenched specimens
as a function of the tempering temperature at which each specimen was given a one
hour anneal. Note that the hardness of the specimens increases by about 150 HV 0.3
between room temperature and 100°C. (HV 0.3 signiﬁes a diamond pyramid hardness
measurement made with a 0.3 kg load). This increase in hardness with increasing
temperature is accredited to the clustering of carbon atoms in the martensite just
above room temperature and to the precipitation of ( /H9255/h) carbide just under 100°C. A
signiﬁcant factor with regard to the transition carbides is that they are extremely small
in size, as is to be expected considering the low temperature range in which they form.
They have, however, been identiﬁed with the aid of the electron microscope34and it
appears that the preferred position for their nucleation is the subgrain boundaries inside
the martensite. The average diameter of these subgrains is about 1.0 to 0.1 mm and the
thickness of the ( /H9255/h) carbide subgrain-boundary network is less than 20 nm. It is not
surprising that these carbides can cause an increase in the hardness.

639 19.14 Tempering of a Low-Carbon Steel
19.14 TEMPERING OF A LOW-CARBON STEEL
Several processes that occur during the tempering of high-carbon steels do not nor-
mally appear in the tempering of low-carbon steels. As may be seen in Fig. 19.16, themartensite ﬁnish temperature, M
f, lies above room temperature in steels with less than
about 0.6 percent C. This means that the amount of retained austenite in these steelsshould be small after quenching them from the austenite region, a fact conﬁrmed byFig. 19.17, which shows that the volume fraction of retained austenite is nearly zerobelow 0.4 percent C. Thus, Stage 3 in Table 19.8, which is accredited to the breakdownof retained austenite into ferrite plus cementite, should not be observed below approx-imately 0.4 percent C.
There is also a strong tendency to eliminate or suppress Stage 3 in Table 19.8, where
the precipitation of the transition carbide ( /H9255/h) takes place. This is because in a low-
carbon steel, most of the carbon atoms are able to segregate to dislocations during thequench, and the segregated carbon atoms are apparently too tightly bound to the dislo-cations for them to form transition carbide particles. The fact that in low-carbon steels,all or a large fraction of the carbon atoms are able to segregate during the quench, hasbeen clearly demonstrated by Speich
35using resistivity measurements. The electrical
resistivity of a steel is a function of the carbon concentration, whether the carbon atomsare in solid solution or segregated at dislocations. However, the increase in resistivitywith carbon concentration is greater when the carbon atoms are in solid solution. Thisis shown by the two dashed lines in Fig. 19.28, where the resistivity is plotted againstthe carbon content of the steels. Note that the calculated line marked No segregation has
a much steeper slope than that marked Complete segregation . The experimental data are
also plotted on this ﬁgure as a solid line curve that lies very close to the complete segre-gation line up to 0.2 percent C. According to Speich’s calculations, about 90 percent ofthe carbon is segregated below the 0.2 percent C concentration. Above 0.2 percent C,the slope of the experimental data curve becomes nearly equal to that of the no segre-gation curve. Therefore, it is concluded that in steels with less than 0.2 percent C, thecarbon of the martensite is almost completely segregated. In addition, because the plotof the experimental data effectively assumes the slope of the no segregation line above0.2 percent carbon, it is believed that at this concentration the dislocations in aquenched low-carbon steel become saturated with carbon atoms. A consequence of thisis that in low-carbon steels with greater than 0.2 percent carbon, the carbon availablefor precipitation as a transition carbide is about 0.2 percent smaller than the actual car-bon content of the steel.
Of the various stages listed in Table 19.8, it would appear that for steels with less
than 0.2 percent C, Stage 2, involving the segregation of carbon, actually occurs dur-ing the quench, and thus, is not a true stage of tempering. Stage 3, in which the tran-sition carbide is precipitated, is effectively suppressed because the carbon atoms aresegregated. Stage 4, where the retained austenite is decomposed to ferrite and cemen-tite, is eliminated because there is no retained austenite. This leaves only Stage 5, inwhich the segregated carbon forms small rod-shaped cementite particles and thehigher temperature phenomena, namely spheroidization of the cementite particlesand their growth by Ostwald ripening, and the recovery and recrystallization of theferrite matrix.19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 639

With regard to the tempering phenomena that occur at higher temperatures, Speich
has indicated that the rod-shaped particles dissolve near 400°C and are replaced by
spheroidal Fe3C particles. The Fe3C particles are nucleated at lath boundaries and for-
mer austenite grain boundaries, but there may also be general nucleation.
As for the reactions that occur in the ferrite matrix, the ﬁrst takes place between
500 and 600°C and involves the recovery of the dislocations in the lath boundaries.
This produces a low-dislocation-density acicular ferrite structure. On further heating to
600 to 700°C, the acicular ferrite grains then recrystallize to form an equiaxed ferrite
structure. This recrystallization occurs with greater difﬁculty at higher carbon cencen-
trations because of the pinning action of the carbide particles on the ferrite boundaries.
The end result of tempering in a plain-carbon steel is an aggregate of equiaxed ferrite
grains containing a large number of spheroidal iron-carbide particles. In the Ostwald
ripening stage the spheroidal carbide particles grow. This is accomplished by diffusion
processes and results from the fact that larger particles have lower free energies than do
smaller particles. A study36of the growth kinetics of the carbide particles in iron-carbon
alloys indicates that the growth rate is diffusion-controlled. However, the problem is com-
plex, as indicated by the fact that the effective diffusion constant for growth lies between19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 640

the diffusion coefﬁcients for the diffusion of carbon and for the diffusion of iron in the
ferrite. Figure 19.29 indicates some of the problems associated with studying the growth
of a precipitate. Note that the precipitate particles have a range of particle sizes and that
with increasing annealing time, while the average particle grows in size so that the num-
ber of particles decreases (Fig. 19.30), the range of particle sizes increases. An excellent
series of pictures is shown in Fig. 19.31. These are electron micrographs of the structures
of steel specimens tempered in the range where the carbide particles are coalescing.
19.15 SPHEROIDIZED CEMENTITE
Spheroidized cementite is the name given the structure consisting of cementite spheroids
embedded in a matrix of ferrite when the particles become large enough to be easily
visible under the light microscope. Such a structure is readily attained in a moderate
length of time, if the third stage of tempering is carried out at a temperature just below
the eutectoid temperature (727°C). A typical photograph (made with a light micro-
scope) of a spheroidized cementite structure is shown in Fig. 19.32. This structure is
perhaps the most stable of all the ferrite and cementite aggregates. Martensite, bainite,
and even pearlite can be transformed into this microstructure by holding the metal for
a sufﬁciently long time just below the eutectoid temperature. The formation of the19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 641

is also true that the coarser the pearlite structure the more difﬁcult it is to spheroidize it.
The spheroidized cementite structure is especially desirable in softened high-carbon
steels, for steels containing this microstructure are more readily machined and give better
results when heat-treated. Consequently, high-carbon steel sold under the label “annealed”
will almost always possess a spheroidized structure.
19.16 THE EFFECT OF TEMPERING ON PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
The microstructure changes that occur during tempering greatly change the physical prop-
erties of steel. The hardness of tempered steels will now be considered. The changes in this
property are functions of both tempering time and tempering temperature. Curves such as
those of Figs 19.33 and 19.34, where the hardness (as measured at room temperature after
the tempering heat treatment) is plotted as a function of tempering temperature, speciﬁ-
cally refer to constant tempering times (1 hr) at each tempering temperature. Curves for
both medium- and high-carbon steels are shown in Fig. 19.33 and in each case, the speci-
mens employed were refrigerated at /H11002196°C before tempering. The purpose of this treat-
ment was to reduce the retained austenite in the quenched metal to a negligible quantity,
so that the results plotted in Fig. 19.33 are truly representative of the effects of tempering
martensite. If the specimens had contained a ﬁnite amount of retained austenite, an addi-
tional hardening component would have been introduced due to the transformation of
austenite to martensite or bainite. This is frequently observed in hardness versus temper-
ing temperature curves and appears as a rise in hardness just above room temperature.
A slight increase in hardness (not due to retained austenite) may be observed in the
higher carbon steel (1.4 percent) as the tempering temperature is carried to about 93°C. This
is undoubtedly associated with the precipitation of ( /H9255/h) carbide. A similar rise is not
observed in the lower carbon steel (0.4 percent) because of the much smaller quantity of
(/H9255/h) carbide that can precipitate in this composition. It should also be mentioned that while
the precipitation of epsilon carbide undoubtedly contributes a hardening component to the
steel, the depletion of carbon from the martensite matrix can be expected to contribute a
softening component. The observed hardness, therefore, reﬂects the result of these two
effects. A decided softening of the specimen, however, occurs when reactions associated with19Ch19.qxd  11/6/08  4:00 PM  Page 643
Chapter 19 The Hardening of Steel 644
the formation of cementite become appreciable. This is shown by the marked drop in hard-
ness that starts at about 200°C. In the early parts of this stage, both the solution of epsilon
carbides and the removal of the carbon from the martensite (low-carbon form) should soften
the metal. However, at the same time, cementite precipitates contribute a hardening effect.
When the steel has attained a simple ferrite and cementite structure, further softening
results from the growth or the coalescence of cementite particles. This softening, due to
growth in size and decrease in number of the cementite particles, continues and becomes
more rapid the closer one approaches the eutectoid temperature (727°C). In effect, this
means that for ﬁxed tempering times the hardness of tempered martensite will be lower the
closer one comes to the eutectoid temperature. The curves of Fig. 19.33 are only drawn for
tempering temperatures below 375°C. Above this temperature to 727°C the three given
curves can be expected to continue to fall in hardness with approximately the same slope
as they exhibit in the temperature range from 200°C to 375°C. Figure 19.34 is from the
work of Speich.37It shows the effect of tempering on the hardness (DPH) of steels of low
to medium carbon concentration, and complements the data given in Fig. 19.33. In addi-
tion, this diagram also outlines the reactions that occur during tempering.
A comprehensive illustration of how the hardness of tempered martensite varies in
iron-carbon steels, with both carbon concentration and tempering temperature, appears in
Fig. 19.35. The data for this diagram were obtained by using small thin (2.5 mm thick)
specimens for the higher carbon steels and similar specimens with half this thickness for
the lower carbon steels. The small sizes of the specimens gave them a rapid cooling rateTemperature, °C0 100100200300400Hardness, dph5006007008000.39%C

except for those with the higher carbon concentrations. The volume fraction of retained
austenite in the specimens containing 0.5, 0.72, and 0.98 percent carbon were 3, 7, and
13 percent, respectively. The strong effect of carbon on the hardness of quenched steels is
clearly shown in Fig. 19.35. Note that the effect of carbon on hardness drops sharply as
the tempering temperature is increased.Carbon, percent704°C649°C538°C482°C427°C371°C316°C260°C204°C149°CAS-quenched

19.17 THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN TIME AND TEMPERATURE
IN TEMPERING
The fact that time and temperature have corresponding effects in tempering of steels, espe-
cially in the stage where aggregates of cementite and ferrite are involved, has been known
for a long time. This is demonstrated in a simple fashion in Fig. 19.36, where a number of
curves corresponding to different tempering temperatures are given. In each case, the
curve shows the dependence of hardness on the time at the indicated tempering temper-
ature. The same data can also be related by a simple rate equation
19.9
where tis the time to attain a given hardness, Qis an empirical activation energy for the
process, Ais a constant, and Rand Thave their usual signiﬁcance.
19.18 SECONDARY HARDENING
Most steels are used with either a pearlitic or a quenched and tempered structure consist-
ing of an aggregate of carbide particles embedded in a matrix of ferrite. In either case, a
two-phase ferrite and carbide structure is involved. When alloying elements are added to
steels, they may enter the ferrite or the carbides in varying amounts depending on the
alloying element concerned. Some elements, however, are not found in the carbides.
These include: aluminum, copper, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, and zirconium. Other ele-
ments are found in both the ferrite and the carbides. A number of these elements in the
order of their tendency to form carbides (manganese having the least and titanium the
greatest) are: manganese, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and titanium.
Most alloying elements in steels tend to increase the resistance of the steel to soften-
ing when it is heated, which means that for a given time and temperature of tempering,
an alloy steel will possess a greater hardness after tempering than a plain-carbon steel
of the same carbon content. This effect is especially signiﬁcant in a steel that contains1

647 Problems
appreciable amounts of carbide-forming elements. When these elements are tempered at
temperatures below 540°C, the tempering reactions tend to form cementite particles based
on Fe3C, or, more accurately, (Fe, M)3C where M represents any of the substitutional
atoms in the steel. In general, the alloying elements are present in the cementite particles
only in about the same ratio as they are present in the steel as a whole. However, when
the tempering temperature exceeds 540°C, appreciable amounts of alloy carbides are pre-
cipitated. The precipitation of these new carbides which, in general, do not conform to the
formula (Fe, M)3C, induces a new form of hardening that is believed due to
coherency.38,39A schematic comparison of the tempering curves of a plain-carbon steel
and a steel with large amounts of carbide-forming elements is shown in Fig. 19.37.
That the alloy carbides do not form readily at lower tempering temperatures is
undoubtedly related to the fact that at these tempering temperatures the rate of diffusion
of substitutional elements is too slow to permit their formation. Cementite can form
because the diffusion rate of carbon is still very large at temperatures below 540°C. The
formation of cementite depends only on the diffusion of carbon.
The use of carbide-forming elements in order to produce a steel with a high resistance
to tempering is best illustrated by the so-called high-speed steels. These are tool steels, whose
original purpose was for use as tool bits in lathes and other machines where the cutting edges
often get very hot during machining operations. Steels of this type retain their hardness for
very long periods of time even at a red heat. A typical high-speed composition is represented
by the composition designated 18-4-1, which contains approximately 18 percent tungsten,
4 percent chromium, 1 percent vanadium, in addition to approximately 0.65 percent carbon.
PROBLEMS
19.1 (a) Determine the ideal critical diameter, DI, of an

(b) Determine the DIof this steel.
(c) At what distance along a Jominy bar of this steel would
one expect to ﬁnd the HRC corresponding to 50 percent

19.3 What diameter of bar of the plain-carbon steel of
Prob. 19.2 will have a 50 percent martensitic structure at
its center after being properly austenitized and given avery good oil quench?
19.4 The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) speci-
ﬁcations for steels require only that the concentrations of
the alloying elements fall within speciﬁed limits. As anexample, consider the steel designated AISI 4135. Thespeciﬁcations call for a carbon concentration between0.32 to 0.38 percent, manganese between 0.60 to 1.00,silicon from 0.20 to 0.35, chromium from 0.75 to 1.20,and molybdenum from 0.15 to 0.25. Compute the D
Ifor
an AISI 4140 steel (grain size 7) containing only theminimum concentration of each alloying element.
19.5 Determine the D
Ifor AISI 4135 when it contains the
maximum concentrations of the various elements. Note: the
multiplying factor for 1.20 percent Cr is 3.592.
19.6 The answers to Problems 19.4 and 19.5 are DI/H110052.2
and 8.1, respectively. It is interesting to see how this is
reﬂected in their respective Jominy curves. This can bedemonstrated with the aid of tabulated distance hardnessdividing factors that are listed in ASTM A 255. With thesefactors it is possible to determine the hardness at variousdistances along a Jominy bar, given a value of D
Iand the
initial hardness at 1/16 in. from the quenched end of thebar. This initial hardness, designated as IH, is normally
assumed to equal that of a 100 percent martensitic structureand can be obtained from the carbon concentration of thesteel. The hardness at a given distance along the Jominy baris then computed by dividing the value of the IHby the dis-
tance hardness dividing factor corresponding to the distance in
question. The distance hardness dividing factors for steelswith D
I/H110052.2 and DI/H110057.0 are listed in the table below.
(a) Determine the two IHvalues.
(b) Divide the IHvalues by their respective distance hard-
ness dividing factors to obtain two sets of Jominy hardnessvalues, and plot these as two separate Jominy curves.19.7 Consider an AISI 4135 steel in which all of the alloy-
ing elements have the mean or average value of theirranges.
(a) Determine its ideal critical diameter.
(b) Determine the maximum diameter of a bar of this
material that can be quenched so as to obtain a 50
percent martensite–50 percent pearlite structure at itscenter when given a poor oil quench.
(c) Make the same computation, but now assume that
the bar is given a brine quench.
19.8 In certain cases the grain size of a metal may be of
the order of several tenths of a mm. Approximately what
is the ASTM grain size number of a metal whose grain
size is 0.2 mm?
19.9 (a) Determine the relative volume change when a
carbon steel containing 0.6 percent of carbon is reacted toform 100 percent martensite.
(b) What is the corresponding change in a linear dimension?
(c) Assuming that Young’s modulus is 206,850 MPa,
what tensile stress would have to be applied to this steel
in order to obtain a strain equivalent to that found in (b) of this problem?
(d) The compressibility of iron at room temperature is:
Determine the magnitude of the pressure increase that
would be needed in order to decrease the volume of the0.6 percent C steel specimen by an amount equal to theexpansion that occurs when it transforms from austeniteto martensite.

20.1 COMMERCIALLY PURE COPPER
Of all the metals, copper has the second highest electrical and thermal conductivities.
Only silver has higher abilities to transport electricity and heat. Thus, it is not strange thatthe most common use for copper is in applications where high electrical or thermalconductivities are required. Table 20.1 lists the room temperature electrical and thermalconductivities of copper, as well as those of a number of other metals. An important con-sideration is the fact that even small amounts of impurities adversely affect the conduc-tivities, because any irregularity inside the space lattice of a metal causes scattering ofelectrons and a reduction in their mean free path. Consequently, the purity of copperintended for use in wires and other shapes used in transporting electricity must be care-fully controlled. Figure 20.1 shows the effects of a number of alloying elements on theconductivity of copper. Note that almost all of the alloying elements reduce the conduc-tivity of copper, with silver having the least effect. It should be noted that the reductionof the conductivity does not depend on the conductivity of the alloying element, but onthe particular effect of the alloying element on the copper lattice. Because of this, whenit is desired to harden copper for electrical applications, silver is normally the best alloy-ing element to use. However, it is usually too expensive. Phosphorus, one of the bestdeoxidizers used during the melting and reﬁning of copper, unfortunately lowers theconductivity of copper very rapidly.
The three principal forms of commercially pure copper used for conductivity pur-
poses are: (a) electrolytic tough-pitch copper, (b) deoxidized low-phosphorus copper, and(c) oxygen-free electronic copper (OFHC). The ﬁrst, electrolytic tough pitch, which is alsoused for automobile radiators, gaskets, kettles, and pressure vessels, contains more than99 percent copper. It also has from 0.02 to 0.05 percent oxygen, which is added deliber-ately to remove soluble impurities by forming insoluble oxide particles (for example, Fein solid solution forms Fe
3O4precipitates). Since the maximum solubility of oxygen in
copper is approximately 0.004 weight percent at 1339 K, the remaining oxygen formscompound cuprous oxide (Cu
2O) in the interdendritic regions during solidiﬁcation of the
metal. This can be seen in Fig. 20.2A. Upon subsequent working and annealing, theseparticles tend to strengthen the matrix. However, the alignment of these particles alonggrain boundaries, as shown in Fig. 20.2B, can also lead to the embrittlement of the cop-per. Impurities also directly affect electrical conductivity and mechanical properties uponrecycling of copper.
1
Deoxidized low-phosphorus copper usually contains from 0.01 to 0.04 percent phos-
phorus. According to Fig. 20.1, this material has an approximately 15 percent lower con-ductivity than pure copper. Thus, it is widely used for piping and tubing applications ratherthan for electrical applications.

Oxygen-free electronic copper, on the other hand, contains more than 99.99 percent
copper with a maximum oxygen concentration of only 0.001 weight percent. This material
is melted and cast in a carbon monoxide atmosphere and is used in electrical applications.
Its conductivity is almost the same as tough-pitch copper, but it has the advantage that it
can be cold worked more extensively than tough-pitch copper.
There are other commercially pure coppers available, to which small concentra-
tions of alloying elements are added for specific applications. For example, there
are electrical applications that require an increased strength which can be obtained
by cold working OFHC. Unfortunately, however, pure copper has a low recrystalliza-
tion temperature. In order to increase the recrystallization temperature, a small
amount of silver, 0.03–0.05 weight percent, can be added. This addition reduces
the conductivity by only about 1 percent while increasing the recrystallization
temperature to approximately 600 K. The silver-bearing alloy , as it is called, is pre-
ferred in the manufacture of electric motors and commutators. Other examples
include arsenical copper containing about 0.3 percent arsenic which has improved20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 653

corrosion resistance, and free-cutting copper containing about 0.6 percent tellurium
which has excellent machining properties.
20.2 COPPER ALLOYS
The copper-zinc alloys, which are known as brasses, are the most widely used copper-based alloys. Brasses may contain from 3 to 45 percent zinc, with the balance being cop-per. However, other minor alloying elements, such as lead, tin, or aluminum, may beintentionally added to achieve a desired color, strength, ductility, machinability, corrosionresistance and/or formability. It is because of this variability that brass alloys ﬁnd a widevariety of applications in items such as coins, jewelry, cartridges, hinges, electrical connec-tors, terminals, bearings, gears, and springs.
2,3Table 20.2 lists some of the common brasses
and other copper alloys with their compositions. It should be noted that alloys containingup to about 36 percent zinc are normally called alpha brasses and those containing more
than 38 percent zinc are known as alpha plus beta brasses . Alpha brasses are frequently
single-phase solid solutions, although those containing more zinc may, under some cir-cumstances, contain some of the beta phase.
In general, the cost of a brass is lower, the higher its zinc content. Because of this,
“yellow or high brasses” are most commonly used in ordinary applications. “Low brass,” on

water pipes. With respect to corrosion resistance, red brass is even better. Cartridge brass (30percent zinc) and other deep drawing brasses are usually manufactured with a very lowimpurity level. Muntz metal, on the other hand, consists of two phases, alpha /H11001beta, and
is used mostly in the form of extrusions.
The term bronze is commonly used to describe copper-tin-zinc or other complex alloys.
Historically, multicomponent alloys of copper and zinc that contain less tin than zinc werecalled brasses , while copper and tin alloys that contain less zinc than tin were called bronzes .
However, other alloys that contain no tin, or relatively small amounts of tin, are also com-monly called bronzes . For example, the casting alloys in this category include aluminum
bronze (5 to 15 percent aluminum), silicon bronze (over 0.5 percent silicon), nickel bronze(over 10 percent nickel), lead bronze (over 30 percent lead), and beryllium bronze(around 2 percent beryllium). Some wrought alloys also contain no tin, but are still calledbronze. Examples include commercial bronze (alloy designation number C22000), whichconsists of 90 percent Cu and 10 percent Zn, and jewelry bronze (alloy number C22600),which consists of 87.5 percent Cu and 12.5 percent Zn.
The copper-zinc phase diagram has a retrograde character on its copper-rich side.
Thus, the solubility increases from 31.9 percent at the peritectic temperature (903°C) toabout 38.3 percent at 450°C and then decreases to about 28 percent around room temper-ature. The Cu-Zn phase diagram is shown in Fig. 11.23.
The extensive solubility of zinc in copper is due to the fact that the atomic size differ-
ence between these two elements is only about 4 percent. The atomic radius of copper thatcrystallizes in the fcc structure is 0.1277 nm, while that of zinc with the hcp structureis 0.1332 nm.
The alpha brasses are solid solutions at room temperature. The as-cast structures of
these alloys consist of cored solid-solution dendrites with the cores of the dendrite armscontaining less zinc than the sides. Upon annealing, the microsegregation due to coring iseliminated. If the alloy has been plastically deformed, or sometimes if it contains residualstresses due to cooling after casting, recrystallization also takes place during annealing. Therecrystallized structure commonly contains annealing twins, which appear as narrowbands with straight sides.
The alpha brasses are highly ductile at room temperature and can be easily deformed
into intricate shapes by a variety of deformation processes, such as deep drawing, coldrolling, and stamping. In general, brasses have mechanical properties that are superior tothose of copper. The solid-solution alloys have higher tensile strengths and elongations atfracture than commercially pure copper. This can be seen in Fig. 20.3, where the effectsof zinc additions on the tensile strength, hardness, and elongation of copper are illus-trated. This ﬁgure also shows the conductivity of the alloy as a function of its zinc con-centration. The tensile strength of alpha brass increases with increasing zinc content,whereas the electrical conductivity (and thermal conductivity, not shown in the ﬁgure)shows the opposite trend. The tensile strength of the alloy also depends on its grain size,as shown in Fig. 20.4. This behavior, as described earlier, occurs because the grain bound-aries inhibit slip and contribute to work hardening and the grain-boundary area per unitvolume increases as the grain size decreases. The strengthening follows the Hall-Petchrelationship, but the strengthening efﬁciency seems to decrease as the grain size isreduced to nanoscale.

The beta ( /H9252) phase is a body-centered cubic electron compound that is approxi-
mately centered about the composition CuZn. The homogeneity range of the compound20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 655

decreases with decreasing temperature from about 800°C. At 800°C the homogeneity
range is from 39 to 55 percent zinc, while at 500°C it is from 45 to 49 percent. The /H9252
phase undergoes ordering when the temperature falls below 470°C. The long-range
ordered /H9252/H11032phase has a bcc superlattice in which each zinc atom is surrounded by eight
copper atoms, and vice versa.
As discussed in Sec. 11.15, the /H9252and /H9252/H11032phases differ only in that the former has a 
disordered bcc structure, whereas the latter is ordered.
The disorder-order transformation is so very fast that even rapid quenching cannot
suppress ordering, with the result being that it is not possible to retain the disordered0010203040506070

phase at room temperature. The ordered phase commonly contains many domains that
are separated by antiphase domain boundaries. When a disordered phase transforms to
an ordered structure, the transformation involves the nucleation and growth of many
separate ordered regions (domains). In the CuZn system, two distinct types of ordered
domains are possible. For one type, the bcc structure can be thought of as having a zinc
atom at its center with copper atoms at the corners, whereas for the other, a copper
atom will be at the center and zinc atoms at the corners. When these two conﬁgurations
(“phases”) come together, a boundary, called an antiphase domain boundary , forms
between them.
The domain size depends upon the cooling rate. Very slow cooling from the /H9252
region allows the development of a relatively coarse domain size, whereas faster
cooling results in the formation of a finer domain size. Figure 20.5 shows the effect
of the cooling rate on the as-quenched hardness of Cu-48.5 percent Zn. It can be seen
that the hardness of the ordered alloy not only depends on the cooling rate during
quenching but also on the temperature from which the sample is quenched. The
quenching temperature that produces the maximum strength is also a function of the
quenching rate. The strength of the quenched ordered alloy is commonly attributed
to the size of the antiphase domain; the finer the domain size, the harder the mate-
rial. On the other hand, Brown5attributes the strengthening of quenched CuZn to
vacancies generated during the rapid disorder-to-order transformation. These vacan-
cies probably originate from interactions between dislocations during long-range
ordering.03040

20.3 COPPER BERYLLIUM
In some copper alloy systems, alloying additions are made that exceed the solubility limit on
cooling so that second-phase precipitates tend to form during cooling. The copper-beryllium
alloys are an example. As shown in Fig. 20.6, the maximum solubility limit of beryllium in
copper is 1.6 percent at 620°C (893 K), which decreases to less that 0.5 percent at 300°C
(573 K). Consequently, alloys with less beryllium than the maximum (1.6 percent) can have
a single phase at high temperatures, but two phases at room temperature; one of these phases
will be the alpha phase and the other the intermetallic compound /H9253with the composition
CuBe. The intermetallic phase will appear as precipitate particles within the matrix. These Cu-
Be alloys are able to undergo an age hardening reaction similar to those of the Al-Cu or Cu-
Al alloys. For example, when the alloy containing 1 percent beryllium is heated to 900 K,
it will contain only the alpha phase. Upon rapid quenching of this material to room temper-
ature, the formation of the /H9253phase will be suppressed, and the material will consist of a super-
saturated solid solution of beryllium in copper. If the alloy is now heated to 600 K, particles of
the equilibrium /H9253phase will eventually form in the alpha phase. However, as in many other
precipitation and age hardening processes, the formation of the equilibrium phase is preceded
by the formation of GP zones and a metastable /H9253/H11032precipitate. As discussed in Chapter 16 on
precipitation hardening, it should be noted that in some alloys, such as Al-Cu, the equilibrium
/H9258is preceded by GP zones and two metastable phases ( /H9258/H11032/H11032and /H9258/H11032). In the Cu-Be system, the
precipitation sequence is (1) disk-shaped GP zones, (2) /H9253/H11032, and (3) /H9253(CuBe).
As a result of precipitation hardening, a considerable strengthening of the alloy can
occur. For example, an alloy containing 1.9 percent Be can attain a hardness of about 42
Rockwell-C by aging at 618 K (345°C) for 4 hours.6This hardness is comparable to those
of some hardened steels. As discussed in Sec. 16.5, careful control of the precipitation time
and temperature must be exercised to attain the maximum strength level. Aging at higher
temperature or longer times may cause the particles to coarsen and soften the alloy. For20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 658

high strength, small and coherent precipitates, tightly bound to the matrix, are needed.
There are also indications that certain copper-Be alloys have another attractive character-
istic that needs to be mentioned. These alloys can experience martensitic transformations
similar to those that occur in some Cu-Al, Cu-Sn, and Cu-Zn alloys.7
20.4 OTHER COPPER ALLOYS
Other alloying elements, such as tin, aluminum, or nickel, are also added to copper to obtain
higher tensile strength or hardness, wear resistance, special corrosion resistance, or any com-
bination of these. A detailed discussion of these alloys can be found elsewhere.8–11The pres-
ence of a second phase in a copper alloy does not always produce an increase in strength and
hardness of the copper. The opposite might be the case in some alloys. For example, certain
leaded copper alloys contain soft, lead-rich particles. The relatively large size of these particles
and their noncoherent boundaries not only do not contribute to hardening of the alloy but also
tend to lower its overall strength. However, an advantage of leaded copper alloys is improved
machinability, which is an important factor in the manufacture of copper-based alloys.
20.5 ALUMINUM ALLOYS
Aluminum and its alloys possess many attractive characteristics including light weight, high
thermal and electrical conductivities, a nonmagnetic nature, high reﬂectivity, nontarnish-
ing nature, high resistance to corrosion, reasonably high strength with good ductility, and
easy fabrication. Nevertheless, probably the most important characteristic of aluminum is20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 659
Chapter 20 Selected Nonferrous Alloy Systems 660
its low density, which is about one-third that of steels and copper alloys. Because of this,
certain alluminum alloys have a better strength-to-weight ratio than high-strength steels.
Among the many alloying elements added to aluminum, the most widely used are
copper, silicon, magnesium, zinc, and manganese. These are used in various combinations,
and in many cases they are used together with other additions to produce classes of age
hardening, casting, and work hardening alloys as shown in Fig. 20.7. All age hardening
alloys contain alloying elements that dissolve in aluminum at elevated (solutionizing) tem-
peratures and precipitate at lower (aging) temperatures. An example of an age hardening
alloy is Al-Cu, which was discussed in Chapter 16. Most casting alloys contain silicon,
which improves the ﬂuidity and mold-ﬁlling capacity of aluminum alloys and reduces
their susceptibility to hot cracking and the formation of shrinkage cavities during solidiﬁ-
cation. Work hardening alloys frequently contain Mn and Mg, which form a ﬁne disper-
sion of intermetallic phases and/or impart solid-solution strengthening.
20.6 ALUMINUM-LITHIUM ALLOYS
Metallurgists have long been challenged with the task of developing lighter and stronger
alloys. One system that has received particular attention is the Al-Li system. Among the alloy-
ing additions, lithium has been identiﬁed as the only alloying element (besides beryllium) that
increases the elastic modulus of Al while at the same time reduces its density. Each weight
percent of lithium decreases the density of aluminum by approximately 3 percent while
increasing its elastic modulus by approximately 6 percent. These two characteristics have pro-
duced a great deal of interest in research and development work on the Al-Li alloys. Al-Li
alloys, however, suffer from both low ductility and fracture toughness. As will be discussed
later, the low ductility has been attributed to strain localization caused by precipitate-free
zones (PFZ) and/or shearable coherent precipitates. Hence, recent alloy developments haveAlMgZn

concentrated on modifying the structure of the alloy in order to alter its deformation mecha-
nisms. The most actively pursued method involves the addition of dispersoid forming ele-
ments, such as manganese, chromium, iron, and zirconium. Powder metallurgy is the primary
technique used in the production of dispersoid forming alloys; it achieves a ﬁne homogeneous
distribution of the dispersoids throughout the matrix. The powder metallurgy technique
involves the production of alloy powders from a liquid melt by atomization, followed by hot
pressing or hot extruding of powder preforms into ingots. Although improvements in ductil-
ity have been achieved, the addition of dispersoid elements undoubtedly affects adversely the
low-density characteristics of the Al-Li alloys that initially created interest in them.
Lithium has a signiﬁcant solubility in aluminum, with a maximum of 5.2 weight
percent (2.14 at. percent) at the eutectic temperature of 809 K (536°C). Figure 20.8 shows
the Al-rich corner of the Al-Li phase diagram. When Al-Li alloys are cooled slowly from
the single-phase ﬁeld, they decompose to form the equilibrium /H9251and /H9254phases, where the
latter is the intermetallic (AlLi) phase. However, when the alloy is quenched to lower tem-
peratures, the decomposition process goes through a continuous precipitation of /H9254/H11032parti-
cles that are ﬁnely distributed throughout the matrix. The age hardening sequence of the
Al-Li alloys can therefore be written as:
Supersaturated /H9251:/H9254/H11032(Al3Li) :/H9254(AlLi) 20.1
The metastable /H9254/H11032phase, with the composition Al3Li, is an ordered, coherent precipitate
with the Li2superlattice crystal structure. This fcc structure is similar to that of Cu3Au, with
the lithium atoms occupying the corners and the aluminum atoms the faces of the fcc unit
cell. The particles of /H9254/H11032form as spheres in a cube-to-cube orientation relationship with the
matrix. The misﬁt strain between the matrix and the precipitate is less than 0.2 percent and
the interfacial energy of the boundary between the matrix and the precipitate has been

particles have been observed to grow to a size of about 0.3 /H9262m without a breakdown in
their interfacial coherency. Attaining such a large size without losing coherency is due to
the relatively low misﬁt strain existing between the /H9254/H11032particles and the matrix.
Figure 20.9 shows the effect of aging time on the size of the /H9254/H11032precipitates in a
multicomponent Al-Li alloy containing 3 percent lithium, 5.5 percent magnesium, and0.2 percent zirconium. The behavior of these precipitates in this multicomponent alloy issimilar to that in the simple binary alloy. The growth, size, and distribution of the 
/H9254/H11032pre-
cipitate follow the Lifshitz-Wagner theory of the kinetics of precipitate coarsening andshow a classical change in the average particle radius with t
2/3, where tis the time.
The exact mechanism of the /H9254/H11032precipitate formation is still undetermined. Probable
formation mechanisms include either homogeneous nucleation or spinodal decomposi-tion. Some experiments show that step quenching to eliminate excess vacancies does notinﬂuence the 
/H9254/H11032precipitation, nor do grain boundaries or dislocations at low aging tem-
peratures. On the other hand, Noble and Thompson14reported an incubation time for /H9254/H11032
formation in an alloy containing 2 percent lithium, and no incubation time for lithiumconcentrations greater than 2 percent. This tends to support the spinodal decompositionmechanism, but direct conclusive evidence has not yet been found.
Overaging of Al-Li alloys results in the dissolution of the metastable 
/H9254/H11032and the nucle-
ation and growth of the semicoherent equilibrium Al-Li ( /H9254) phase. This phase has been
observed to nucleate heterogeneously in both the matrix and at grain boundaries, andindependently of 
/H9254/H11032.
The ordered coherent /H9254/H11032precipitate in the Al-Li alloys results in a unique failure
mechanism that depends on the microstructural state. In general, strengthening by agehardening is related to the size and distribution of the precipitates and their interactionwith dislocations. This is also true for Al-Li alloys. The plastic deformation of aluminumand most of its alloys occurs by the motion of dislocations on {111} close-packedplanes along /H20855110/H20856close-packed directions. Three failure modes have been identiﬁed in 
Al-Li alloys, and they are shown schematically in Fig. 20.10. The ﬁrst mechanism, inFig. 20.10A, involves the shearing of precipitates. Mechanical loading of a structure contain-ing ordered 
/H9254/H11032precipitates that are coherent can result in the passage of dislocations through
the precipitates. The passage of a dislocation through an unsheared precipitate lattice createsa disturbance in the order of this lattice and produces what is known as an antiphase bound-
ary(APB) in the precipitate. The extra energy associated with the APB normally should
impede the motion of other dislocations, and thus have a strengthening effect on the lattice.However, when a precipitate is sheared by the ﬁrst dislocation, the passage of a seconddislocation, lying on the same plane as the ﬁrst dislocation, restores the order disturbed bythe ﬁrst dislocation. Thus, dislocations in these alloys tend to move in pairs. Such a pair iscalled
14,15a superdislocation . After the passage of a superdislocation, the net cross-sectional
area of the precipitate on the slip plane is reduced by an amount proportional to the Burgersvector. As such, the size of the precipitate on the slip plane is effectively reduced and theenergy required for the movement of subsequent dislocations is lowered. Thus, once slipstarts on a particular plane, further slip on that plane becomes easier. Consequently, intenseplanar slip can occur leading to dislocation pile-ups at grain boundaries and subsequentgrain-boundary failure. This mechanism of failure is called strain localization .
The above-mentioned strain localization due to the shearing of precipitates is one
reason for the low ductility of certain precipitation-hardened aluminum alloys thatinclude the Al-Li alloys. The second failure mechanism, as shown in Fig. 20.10B, is due to20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 662

the formation of precipitate-free zones (PFZ) adjacent to the grain boundaries. The pre-
cipitate-free zones are softer than the matrix and can become the sites of concentrated
deformation that lead to rapid work hardening in these areas and subsequent brittle inter-
granular failure. Hence, numerous studies have been made concerning the formation of
the precipitate free zones.16,17From these studies, two different mechanisms of PFZ for-
mation have emerged; one involves vacancy depletion and the other solute depletion.
The formation of a vacancy-depleted PFZ can be explained if the solute concentration
is assumed constant throughout the matrix so that there is no segregation of solute at the
grain boundaries. In this case, after quenching from the solution temperature, a vacancy
concentration gradient will be established in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, as
demonstrated in Fig. 20.11A. This occurs because the grain boundaries are sinks for vacan-
cies. The vacancy concentration gradient at a grain boundary will be dependent on both
the solution temperature and the severity of the quench. As the quench rate decreases, the
concentration gradient decreases. A similar argument holds for the solution temperature;
that is, a higher solution temperature gives a steeper gradient. As discussed in Sec. 16.4,
vacancies play a very important role in the formation of GP zones and coherent precipi-
tates. In fact, in many cases, a critical vacancy supersaturation is necessary for the forma-
tion of these precipitates. Obviously, for a given set of aging conditions, if the vacancy
concentration falls below this critical limit, the nucleation and growth of the precipitates
may be so diminished that a precipitate-free zone forms at the grain boundaries.
A precipitate-free zone may also occur when solute is lost near the grain boundaries due
to the heterogeneous nucleation of precipitates at the grain boundaries. (See Sec. 16.10.)
Heterogeneous nucleation of the equilibrium /H9254(Al-Li) phase at grain boundaries is possible
when during cooling the temperature of the alloy drops below the solvus line. As a result, a
solute concentration proﬁle is established adjacent to a grain boundary, as shown in
Fig. 20.11B. The size of the solute-depleted zone and its gradient depend on the aging tem-
perature and time.18At low aging temperatures, the width of the PFZ formed is less than that
at high aging temperatures. When the vacancy or solute concentration adjacent to the grain
boundaries falls below a certain limit at a given aging temperature, homogeneous nucleation
of precipitates in these regions may become impossible. Consequently, a lithium-depleted
/H9254/H11032precipitate-free zone is formed along the grain boundary which contains relatively large
particles of the equilibrium /H9254phase. This yields a microstructure that is sometimes referred20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 664

to as a necklace structure . Since the precipitate-free zones are softer than the matrix that con-
tains precipitate particles, they become preferential sites of greater deformation; that is, strain
localization. This develops large stress concentrations at grain-boundary triple points and
leads to a lowering of the ductility and thus, to earlier fracture.
The third mechanism of failure in AL-Li alloys appears in Fig. 20.10C. In this case,
the presence of hard incoherent dispersoids, added as grain reﬁners or constituent phases
in the form of impurities, leads to microvoid nucleation and coalescence as a result of the
passage of dislocations. For example, it has been shown that the addition of magnesium
to aluminum-lithium alloys is capable of raising the yield stress, tensile strength, and duc-
tility if the magnesium content does not exceed 4 weight percent.19The particles formed
as a result of the magnesium additions provide strengthening by inhibiting dislocation
motion, but they also serve as sites for the nucleation of microvoids, which promote the
third mechanism of fracture. Higher concentrations of magnesium also result in increas-
ing amounts of intergranular fracture due to the formation of particles at the grain
boundaries.20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 665

Vol. 33, No. 8, 24 1981.)The problems associated with strain localization within the matrix can be minimized by
properly alloying and heat treating the alloy. The general purpose is to change the defor-
mation mode of the alloy from dislocation shearing of precipitates to dislocation looping or
bypassing of precipitates. Some of the additives also strengthen the matrix. Among the var-
ious alloying elements, Mg, Cu, and Zr are the most widely used. Figure 20.12 shows the

Magnesium additions increase the strength of Al-Li alloys by solid solution strength-
ening of the matrix and by enhancing the /H9254/H11032precipitations. In aged Al-Li-Mg alloys,
magnesium additions produce a 50 MPa increase in yield stress for each weight percent
addition if the magnesium concentration is less than 2 percent. Additions beyond 2 percent
give a 20 MPa increase for each weight percent addition, which is similar to the effect in
Al-Mg alloys. The latter is due to the fact that magnesium reduces the solubility of
lithium in the matrix and thus increases the precipitation of the /H9254/H11032phase. Magnesium
additions greater than 2 weight percent promote the formation of the equilibrium
Al2LiMg phase.20Its structure is fcc with a lattice parameter of 1.99 nm. The Al2LiMg
phase precipitates as rods with a /H20855110 /H20856growth direction. The orientation relationship
with the alpha matrix is:
(110)Al2LiMg/H20841/H20841(110)/H9251; (110)Al2LiMg/H20841/H20841(111)/H925120.2
Hence, Al2LiMg is semicoherent and exhibits accommodation dislocations. The formation
of Al2LiMg from solid solution has been reported to proceed as follows:

within the matrix and at grain boundaries, which implies it forms independently of the /H9254/H11032

Zirconium is added to Al-Li alloys primarily as a grain reﬁner. It forms an intermetal-
lic compound, Al3Zr, which has a tetragonal (DO23) structure. This intermetallic com-
pound is stable at high temperatures and resists coarsening. Hence, it cannot be
manipulated or affected by subsequent processing. It has also been reported that zirconium
reduces the solubilities of lithium and magnesium in aluminum.21
20.7 TITANIUM ALLOYS
Titanium and its alloys are widely used as structural materials in the aerospace and chem-
ical industries because of their lower density combined with high strength and corrosion
resistance. The low density of titanium, 4.5 Mg/m3, as compared with approximately 
7.8 Mg/m3for steels and superalloys, offers the possibility of substantial reductions in air-
frame weight and increased thrust/weight ratios of their jet engines. As shown in Fig. 20.13,20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 668
669 20.7 Titanium Alloys
the tensile strength/density ratios of titanium alloys are considerably higher than those of
steels and aluminum alloys at ordinary temperatures. The yield strength/density ratios of
titanium alloys are also higher than those of steels and aluminum and magnesium alloys.
It is because of this property that titanium alloys have been widely used instead of iron or
nickel-based alloys in aerospace applications. In addition, the high melting point of the
metal (2093 K) places titanium among the refractory metals, making it attractive for many
high temperature applications. However, the chemical behavior of the metal normally lim-
its the application of titanium alloys to low to moderately elevated temperatures. At low
temperatures, titanium passivates and becomes almost completely inert to most mineral
acids and chlorides. At high temperatures, on the other hand, titanium oxidizes quickly and
its properties are greatly altered by the adsorption of oxygen interstitials from the air. It
should be noted that heating titanium in air results not only in oxidation but also in disso-
lution of oxygen and nitrogen in the surface layers of titanium, causing solid-solution
hardening of the surface. The thickness of the “air contaminated layer” depends on the tem-
perature as well as the dissolution time. Normally, this layer is removed by machining or
other means prior to using the alloy because the presence of the air contaminated layer
reduces the fatigue strength and ductility. Pure titanium undergoes an allotropic transfor-
mation at about 1158 K; it changes from the close-packed hexagonal crystal structure to
the body-centered cubic crystal structure. The high-temperature bcc phase, called the beta
phase, has a lattice parameter of 0.332 nm at 1200 K and a density of about 
4.35 Mg/m3. For the low-temperature hcp phase, called the alpha phase, a/H110050.29503 nm,
c/H110050.468312 nm, and c/a/H110051.5873. The room temperature density of /H9251is 4.507 Mg/m3.
The beta to alpha transformation in pure titanium occurs very easily and cannot be
suppressed by rapid quenching. Because of this, it is widely believed that the transforma-
tion is a diffusionless martensitic transformation, rather than one that is diffusion con-
trolled. Figure 20.14 shows a proposed mechanism by which the bcc structure transforms

to hcp. In order to form the hexagonal cell, it is necessary to change the angle ABC from
70°32 /H11032to 60°. This can be accomplished by a shear on the (112) plane and in the /H20855111/H20856
direction of the bcc structure. Additional contraction and expansion of the cell edges, plus
displacement of the center atom, will then result in the formation of the hcp structure.
The allotropic phase transformation temperature of titanium depends strongly on
the amount and nature of the alloying elements. Some alloy additions tend to raise thetransformation temperature. These are called alpha (
/H9251) stabilizers . Others lower this tem-
perature and are called beta(/H9252) stabilizers . Among the former elements, carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen, and aluminum are the most important; their phase diagrams are shown in Fig. 20.15. Carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen are rapidly absorbed by titanium when the metalis hot, and consequently some of these elements are expected to be present in all of thecommercial grades of titanium. In addition, all of these elements harden and solutionstrengthen 
/H9251titanium. Aluminum has signiﬁcant solubility in both alpha and beta phases,
and because of this, it strengthens both phases.
The elements that lower the transformation temperature and stabilize /H9252can arbi-
trarily be divided into two classes: (1) those that undergo eutectoid transformations,such as chromium, iron, copper, nitrogen, palladium, cobalt, manganese, and hydrogen,and (2) those that are isomorphous with 
/H9252at high temperatures and form /H9251/H11001/H9252equi-
librium phases at ordinary temperatures. Examples of these two classes are shown inFig. 20.16. Among the latter are molybdenum, tantalum, vanadium and niobium. Theseelements have limited solubility in the alpha phase. In general, beta stabilizers impartsolid-solution hardening to the beta phase but, in contrast with the alpha stabilizers,affect the alpha phase very little. Consequently, a combination of alpha and beta stabi-lizers can be added to the two-phase alpha and beta alloys, in order to strengthen bothphases. Zirconium and hafnium are called sister elements of titanium because they areisomorphous with both the alpha and beta phases.
20.8 CLASSIFICATION OF TITANIUM ALLOYS
Commercial titanium alloys are classiﬁed as “ /H9251or near /H9251alloys,” “ /H9251/H11001/H9252” and “ /H9252” alloys.
Table 20.4 gives a summary of some of these alloys. The table also lists different grades ofcommercially pure titanium. It should be noted that the various grades of pure titaniumdepend on the impurity content, most notably oxygen and iron. Higher purity grades con-tain lower levels of interstitials and have lower strength, hardness, and transformationtemperatures than lower purity grades. As shown in Table 20.4, the yield strength of theunalloyed grades vary from 170 MPa to 485 MPa, depending on the impurity and inter-stitial contents. Unalloyed grades of titanium account for about 30 percent of total tita-nium production, as compared with 45 percent for the most widely used Ti-6Al-4V, and25 percent for all other remaining alloys.
20.9 THE ALPHA ALLOYS
Alpha alloys contain alpha stabilizers such as Al and Sn, singly or in combination, and arehcp at ordinary temperatures. Aluminum has a strong solid-solution hardening effect ontitanium, as may be seen in Fig. 20.17, but it also reduces the ductility. The addition of tinalso strengthens 
/H9251titanium, however, without a signiﬁcant loss of ductility. In many
instances, both alloying elements are added together as in the commercial Ti-5Al-2.5Snalloy. The 
/H9251titanium alloys are generally categorized by good strength, toughness, creep20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 670

resistance, and weldability. However, unlike other titanium alloys, alpha alloys cannot be
strengthened by heat treatment. They are generally annealed or recrystallized to remove
residual stresses induced during cold working.
Alpha alloys containing extra low levels of interstitials (ELI grades), such as Ti-5Al-
2.5Sn-ELI, retain ductility and toughness at cryogenic temperatures. Because of the
absence of a ductile-brittle transformation, a property of the bcc structure, these alpha
alloys have been extensively used in cryogenic applications. Some alpha alloys contain
small additions of beta stabilizers, such as Ti-4Al-1Mo-1V, and contain some retained beta
phase. Nevertheless, since the majority of the alloys consists of the alpha phase, they
behave more like alpha alloys than alpha-beta alloys.
20.10 THE BETA ALLOYS
Beta alloys generally contain one or more of the so-called beta stabilizers, such as molyb-
denum, vanadium, or chromium. These alloys are characterized by high hardenability and
forgeability. They are, however, susceptible to a ductile-brittle transformation and are
unsuitable for low-temperature applications.
In the solution-treated conditions, beta alloys have good ductility, toughness, and
excellent formability. The most important advantage of beta alloys over alpha alloys is
that they can be age hardened to cause partial transformation of the metastable beta
phase to alpha. The age hardening process, which is commonly accomplished at 700
to 900 K, results in the formation of finely dispersed alpha particles in the retained
beta phase.20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 676

Alloys , 3rd Ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, 1965. Used with permission.)20.11 THE ALPHA-BETA ALLOYS
Alpha-beta alloys contain mixtures of both the alpha and the beta stabilizers such that the
alloys retain a mixture of the alpha and beta phases at room temperature.
The dual-phase structure of these alloys makes them considerably stronger than
either the alpha or beta alloys. Moreover, the alpha-beta alloys can be further strength-
ened by heat treatment. This is accomplished by quenching the alloys from the /H9251/H11001/H9252
phase ﬁeld, followed by aging at a moderate temperature. The heat treatment cycle for a
typical alloy is schematically shown in Fig. 20.18. It should be noted that the maximum
heating temperature is in the two-phase /H9251/H11001/H9252region, as marked by point ain the 
ﬁgure, in contrast with the usual age hardening of other alloys such as Al-Cu. For the lat-
ter alloys, the maximum temperature is in the one-phase region, and a single-phase solid
solution is formed prior to quenching. For alpha-beta alloys, however, heating to the all
beta phase ﬁeld, to a point such as point bin Fig. 20.18A, would result in the formation
of the beta phase with excessively large grains. The subsequent age hardening would also
be mostly at the beta boundaries, and inhomogeneously distributed. These conditions
reduce the ductility of the alloys.
When this alloy is slowly cooled from the beta region, Widmanstätten plates of alpha
initially nucleate at the grain boundaries at about 980°C. The hcp plates form with their
basal planes parallel to the {110} plane of the bcc matrix. This orientation relationship is
similar to that shown earlier for the martensitic transformation of pure Ti. Figure 20.19
schematically shows the formation of Widmanstätten plates in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Note that
the partial phase diagram shown in the left of this ﬁgure is an approximate isopleth for an
alloy containing 6 percent aluminum. Upon continued cooling, the plates thicken rela-
tively slowly at their broad sides which are closely matching the matrix, but grow much20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 677

FIG. 20.19 Schematic illustration of the formation of a Widmanstätten structure in a
Ti-6Al-4V alloy by cooling slowly from above the beta transus. The ﬁnal microstruc-
ture consists of plates of alpha separated by the beta phase. (From Brooks, C.R.,

faster along the edge sides. The ﬁnal microstructure would consist of alpha plates with the
remaining beta in between them.
On the other hand, when the alloy is heated to the two-phase ﬁeld, the presence of
alpha grains inhibits excessive growth of the beta grains. Quenching of this alloy then sup-
presses the transformation of the beta phase, until it is reheated to the aging temperature.
During aging, alpha precipitate particles may form in a manner similar to that described in
the previous section on beta alloys.
It should be noted that upon quenching, beta may decompose by a martensitic type
reaction, forming a metastable phase. Depending upon the quenching temperature and
alloy composition, the spontaneous transformation product may be /H9251/H11032or /H9251”. The struc-
ture of /H9251/H11032has not yet been resolved, but it is indicated to be either face-centered cubic or
face-centered tetragonal22or hcp.23Similarly, /H9251/H11032has been identiﬁed as having either a
hexagonal22or orthorhombic23structure.
Similar to the martensitic transformation in iron base alloys, the formation of martensite
begins at the martensite start temperature, Ms, which depends on the alloy composition.
This is shown schematically in Fig. 20.20. If the amount of the beta stabilizer is such that20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 678

itsMsis lower than room temperature, quenching of the alloy will result in the retainment
of the metastable beta phase. On the other hand, when the Mstemperature is above
room temperature, quenching results in the partial or complete formation of one of the
martensites.
The formation of the titanium martensite produces some hardening of the alloy, but
greater strength can be attained if the quenched alloy is subsequently “aged.” During aging,
some of the /H9251/H11032or /H9251decomposes to alpha and beta, but a part of the retained metastable beta
phase also decomposes to form coherent alpha precipitates in the beta matrix. Additional
details can be found in other references.24–26
It should be recognized that during the aging heat treatment another phase called ( /H9275)
may form that has an undesirable embrittling effect on the alloy. The structure and details
of the formation of /H9275are not yet fully understood.23The omega phase precipitation occurs
athermally within a narrow composition range in many titanium alloys as a result of rapid
quenching from elevated temperatures. Its structures may be either hexagonal or trigonal
depending on the solute concentration.
20.12 SUPERALLOYS
One of the most demanding applications of materials is in gas turbines of military and
commercial aircraft, as well as in other industrial turbines. Gas turbines ingest air from the
atmosphere, compress it, add fuel, and burn the mixture to produce hot inlet gases that
drive the turbine section. The turbine components exposed to the hot gas are subjected to
high-temperature oxidation, hot corrosion, creep, high-cycle fatigue, and thermal fatigue.
The alloys being used for these components are nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-base superalloys.
In addition to gas turbines, super-alloys are also used in space vehicles, nuclear reactors,
submarines, and petrochemical equipment, as well as many other high-temperature appli-
cations. Among superalloys, the nickel-base alloys are most widely used. In this section,
the physical metallurgy of these alloys is brieﬂy discussed. More detailed analysis can be
found in other references.23,27–30
The nominal compositions of typical nickel-base superalloys are shown in Table 20.5.
The oxidation and hot corrosion resistance of the alloys depend mostly on the presence of
Cr. Chromium also imparts a solid-solution strengthening to the alloy. Molybdenum, alu-
minum, niobium, titanium, and other alloy additions also contribute to solid-solution
hardening, as well as serving other functions. The alloys, however, depend for their
strength mostly upon aluminum and titanium, which allow for precipitation hardening of
the alloy. The precipitation hardening results from the formation of an ordered compound20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 679

based on the chemical formula Ni3(Al, Ti), called /H9253/H11032. This phase and the matrix, which is
called /H9253, are fcc but they have different lattice parameters. The lattice mismatch between
the precipitates and the matrix creates coherency strains that impede dislocation migra-
tion, thus resulting in precipitation hardening. Therefore, the mechanical properties of thealloys depend, among other factors, upon the amount, size, and morphology of 
/H9253/H11032and the
elastic strain induced because of the lattice mismatch.
Another factor contributing to the strength and high-temperature stability of the
alloys is the presence of carbide phases such as M23C6, M6C, or MC, where M can be
chromium, titanium, molybdenum, or tungsten. The formation of the carbides has animportant effect on creep properties, but this effect is variable and depends on the alloycomposition, their size, and distribution and processing. The relative amounts of the car-bides also depend on the temperature and processing, as shown in Fig. 20.21. For exam-ple, MC forms upon solidiﬁcation of the alloy, but disappears during aging at lowertemperatures. On the other hand, M
23C6is stable at temperatures below 875°C, but not
at higher temperatures. The reaction between the two carbides can be written as

20.13 CREEP STRENGTH
Turbine blades generally experience longitudinal stresses to approximately 140 MN/m2
(/H1101520,000 psi) and temperatures of 650 to 1000°C in their airfoil section. The blade root,
on the other hand, is subjected to much higher tensile stresses, around 280 to 560 MN/m2,20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 680

but temperatures not exceeding 760°C. The blades not only have to be strong enough to
withstand such high stresses, but they must also have adequate creep resistance.
In order to produce higher creep strengths, the alloy composition can be adjusted to
yield larger amounts of /H9253/H11032. However, such an approach is often accompanied by a reduc-
tion in ductility, which may cause premature fracture. Therefore, traditional alloy devel-
opment is limited. Great improvements in the creep performance can be made by
modifying the grain structure of the alloy, however, particularly by eliminating grain
boundaries that are normal to the stress direction. In general, grain boundaries con-
tribute to creep and eventual failure of the materials by grain boundary sliding and void
formation. It is because of this that large-grain specimens generally have better creep
performance than ﬁne-grain ones, provided that the structure remains stable at high
temperatures.20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 681

FIG. 20.23 The technique used to obtain monocrystal high-temperature turbine
blades. ( ©Slim Films. From Kear, B.H., Scientiﬁc American , October, 1986.)For turbine blades, the stress is predominantly is one direction, the axial direction of
the blade, and so the creep performance can be improved by eliminating the grain bound-
aries perpendicular to the stress direction. This has been accomplished by using directional
solidiﬁcation techniques, rather than conventional casting methods, to cast the blades.
Directional solidiﬁcation results in a microstructure that is either columnar, with the long
axis of the grains parallel to the stress direction, or a monocrystal. Figure 20.22 shows a
comparison of the creep properties of a superalloy (Mar-M200) in the conventionally cast,
columnar grain, and monocrystalline microstructures. During conventional casting of an
object, the heat of fusion is removed from the casting more or less equally in all three
directions and at low temperatures (see Fig. 20.23A). As such, the microstructure consists
of equiaxed grains which have nucleated randomly and grown during solidiﬁcation. It
should be noted that each grain normally is formed by growth of a single dendrite colony.20Ch20.qxd  11/6/08  4:01 PM  Page 682

Metal failure in structural applications refers to the loss of load carrying capacity of a com-
ponent. Fracture, or separation of a component into separate pieces, is the most dramaticexample of such failure, which can lead not only to the loss of functionality of the com-ponent but also to catastrophic damages and personal injuries. Metal may also fail less dra-matically when it cannot hold its dimensions through creep deformation in applicationsthat require close dimensional tolerances.
Fracture is commonly categorized as ductile or brittle. The former is associated with a
failure that occurs at the end of an extensive plastic deformation. Brittle failure, on theother hand, is associated with a minimum plastic deformation. Alternatively, one maythink of ductile fracture as resulting from shear forces that produce deformation along cer-tain crystallographic planes, whereas brittle fracture is due to tensile forces that producecleavage (splitting) on certain crystallographic planes. However, there is considerableconfusion as to how to differentiate explicitly between brittle and ductile fractures. This ismainly because one tends to think in terms of the entire deformation process leading upto the ﬁnal act of fracture. To this must be coupled the fact that the word brittle is associ-
ated with a minimum of plastic deformation, while the word ductile connotes large plastic
deformation. However, metals can fail by cleavage (a basically brittle process) after a rela-tively large preceding macroscopic deformation. In the same manner, it is quite possible tohave a negligible macroscopic strain in a metal that fails by a ductile mechanism. In thelast case, the fracture usually occurs in some localized region in which the deformation isvery high. In viewing the problem of fracture, it would seem best, therefore, to reserve theterms “ductile fracture” and “brittle fracture” to refer to the actual act of propagatinga crack. Thus, a brittle fracture is one in which the movement of the crack involves very
little plastic deformation of the metal adjacent to the crack. Conversely, a ductile crack is one
that spreads as a result of intense localized plastic deformation of the metal at the tip of thecrack. There can, of course, be no sharp division between ductile and brittle failures, butthe extremes of these two methods of failure are quite distinguishable.
Fracture is considered the end result of plastic-deformation processes, and there are
many different ways that plastic deformation leads to failure, as can be seen by consider-ing just a few ways that single crystals fracture.
21.1 FAILURE BY EASY GLIDE
Let us consider the hexagonal metals that deform by easy glide on the basal plane (Zn, Cd,and Mg). In these metals, the single-crystal stress-strain curves depend upon the temper-ature of the test, as shown in Fig. 21.1A for magnesium. At low temperatures (291 K) theslope of the stress-strain curve rises very rapidly, while at higher temperatures (523 K)the slope of the stress-strain curves is small. The rate at which the metal hardens withstrain at lower temperatures is much greater than that at high temperatures. This differenceis undoubtedly due to dynamic recovery, with softening occurring more rapidly during a

emphasized by the fact that increasing the rate of testing has much the same effect on the

From the above it can be concluded that at higher temperatures and at very slow strain
rates basal glide involves very little, if any, strain hardening. Once deformation starts along
those slip bands in which it is easiest to activate dislocation sources, it can continue on them
without appreciable increase in their resistance to slip. This produces coarse, widely sepa-
rated slip bands, as is shown schematically in Fig. 21.2A. The notches formed where slip21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 687

fracturebands cut the surface are a factor in their development. The stress concentration at these
notches aids the slip process in the bands. Finally, as more and more deformation occurs
in the slip bands, the cross-section area of the bands becomes smaller and smaller. This
raises the effective shear stress, thereby increasing the tendency for the slip to remain
conﬁned to the operating bands.
Provided that another plastic deformation process, such as mechanical twinning or slip
on a plane other than the basal plane, does not occur at a late stage in the deformation
process, it is quite possible for a crystal, such as that indicated in Fig. 21.2, to shear com-
pletely in two along one of the coarse slip bands. Shearing in two along a slip band is one
possible mode of single-crystal failure.
21.2 RUPTURE BY NECKING (MULTIPLE GLIDE)
Outside of certain hexagonal metals, single glide is the exception rather than the rule in
single crystals. In cubic metals, after only a relatively small deformation, easy glide
breaks down into multiple glide on two or more systems. When deformation occurs by
slip on several slip systems in a single-crystal tensile test, the rate at which the metal
strain hardens can have an important effect on the fracture mechanism. What generally
happens is that early in the test, some part of the gage length deforms at a slightly more
rapid rate than the rest. The cross-sectional area in this region becomes slightly smaller
than in the rest of the specimen, with a corresponding increase in the shear stress. If the
rate at which the slip planes harden with increasing strain is small, then continued slip
in this reduced section will occur more easily than in the remainder of the specimen. In
this manner a neck can form in the gage length. The various steps involved in the devel-
opment of a neck are outlined schematically in Fig. 21.3 for an assumed case of double
glide. The slip planes are indicated in Fig. 21.3A and are assumed perpendicular to the
plane of the paper, with the slip directions in the plane of the paper. The neck is shown
in Fig. 21.3B, and the ultimate shape of the specimen can be observed in Fig 21.3C. Here21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 688

leading to fracture in twinit can be seen that continued growth of the neck results in a chisel-edge type of failure.
Such a failure is frequently observed in metal crystals.
If more than two slip systems operate during the deformation of a metal crystal and a
neck is formed, the ﬁnal fracture can occur when the cross-section at the neck pulls down
to a point rather than a chisel edge.
It should not be inferred that the end result of multiple glide is always a simple chisel
edge, or point type of fracture. The original orientation of the crystal is an important fac-
tor in determining the character of the fracture. It may well be that as the metal is
deformed and the lattice of the crystal is reoriented by the deformation, other slip systems
will become active in addition to those that were activated at the start of the deformation.
It is thus quite possible, for example, for necking, as a result of multiple glide, to give way
to a ﬁnal fracture by shear on a single plane.
21.3 THE EFFECT OF TWINNING
While the shear associated with mechanical twinning is, in general, small, twinning always
involves a lattice reorientation in the twins. This may place new slip systems in a favorable
position relative to the stress axis, so that plastic deformation occurs more readily inside the
twin than in the parent crystal outside the twin. Thus, when zinc or cadmium crystals are
strained in tension, the basal plane of the crystal rotates toward the stress axis, as shown in
Fig. 21.4. The effect of this rotation is to decrease the shear-stress component on the
basal plane. In order to continue the deformation of the crystal, the tensile force must be
increased. A point is eventually reached where the metal undergoes deformation twinning
on a {10 2} plane. When this occurs, the basal plane in the twin is found to be in a position
favorable for slip. Fracture then occurs as a result of secondary basal slip inside the twin.
The fracture methods illustrated below, which involve large plastic deformation by
slip, differ somewhat from the normal concept of fracture, which usually involves the
spreading of a crack. It is perhaps better, therefore, to classify these forms of metal failure
as ruptures rather than as fractures.121Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 689

Under certain conditions, it is possible to split crystals in two pieces along planes of low
indices. Let us assume that the block in Fig. 21.5A is a single crystal of zinc. Now suppose
that a wedge or knife edge is laid along a basal-plane trace in the manner indicated in the
ﬁgure and that the knife edge is given a sharp blow with a small hammer. If the temper-
ature at which this operation is carried out is sufﬁciently low, the crystal will split, or be
cleaved, into two parts, the separation following the basal plane. (See Fig. 21.5B.) This
operation is called cleavage and the plane on which it occurs is known as the cleavage plane
of the crystal. In the case of zinc, it is, of course, the basal plane (0001).
Zinc crystals are capable of being cleaved at room temperature, but only with some dif-
ﬁculty, and the cleaved surfaces are usually badly distorted. The splitting of zinc crystals
becomes progressively easier the lower the temperature at which cleavage is attempted. Very
nice cleavages may be readily obtained at the temperature of liquid air (77 K). In fact, if a
carefully grown, undistorted zinc crystal is rapidly cleaved at this temperature, the surface
may be so perfect that it becomes impossible to focus on the surface with a light microscope.
An interesting fact relative to the cleavage of zinc crystals is that the fracture follows the
basal plane even in a bent or a distorted crystal. Thus, if a crystal is ﬁrst bent and then
cleaved, as shown in Fig. 21.6, the fracture surface will show the curvature of the basal plane.
This fact has frequently been used in the study of plastic-deformation phenomena (using zinc
crystals), to follow the distortion inside crystals. If should be noted that in polycrystalline
zinc, grain boundaries may affect the deformation, thus masking brittle fracture behavior.121Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 690
691 21.5 The Nucleation of Cleavage Cracks
Because basal cleavage is such a well-known phenomenon in zinc crystals, it is com-
monly believed that other hexagonal metals cleave on the basal plane as readily as zinc.
However, this is not the case, except possibly for beryllium, which has been observed2to
cleave on (0001) and {11 0} planes. Magnesium does not cleave easily on the basal planeor on any other plane, nor is there any information in the literature relative to cleavage ofcadmium crystals. There is also no evidence that anyone has observed true cleavage in aface-centered cubic metal. The one important class of metals in which cleavage is most fre-quently observed is the body-centered cubic metals, although the alkali metals (sodium,potassium, etc.) are body-centered cubic, and evidently do not cleave. The cleavage planein the body-centered lattice form is usually {100}, although there are examples in whichit has been indicated that cleavage along {110} is preferred.
3,4
While most of the commercially important metals are not subject to cleavage, it is still
a signiﬁcant subject because of the fact that iron is a body-centered cubic metal thatcleaves. The low-temperature brittleness of steels can be directly attributed to this fact.When fractures occur in polycrystalline iron or steel by transcrystalline cleavage, very lit-tle energy is expended in propagating the fractures, so that they closely resemble thosethat occur in glass or other brittle isotropic elastic solids.
21.5 THE NUCLEATION OF CLEAVAGE CRACKS
Glass at room temperature can be considered to be a material incapable of plastic deforma-tion. The same is not true of metals that are capable of deforming by slip and twinning evenat temperatures approaching absolute zero. It has also been observed that when a metal failsby brittle cleavage, a certain amount of plastic deformation almost always occurs prior tothe fracture. This has been interpreted by many as evidence that metals do not fracture asthe result of pre-existing Grifﬁth cracks, but that cleavage cracks are probably nucleated byplastic-deformation processes. In conﬁrmation of this point of view is the fact that cleavagecan sometimes be made to occur in the interior of annealed polycrystalline specimens; inthese specimens, there is little likelihood of the existence of small cracks before the applica-tion of stress. In a well-annealed metal, cracks should be self-healing and disappear.
While it is quite possible to nucleate cleavage fractures in metal crystals with a chisel
and hammer, this approach tells us nothing about the formation of fracture nuclei in metalspecimens under normal conditions of loading. Of more interest is how a crack starts in asingle-crystal tensile specimen. A number of these studies have been performed in whichzinc or iron crystals were used.
The fracture surfaces of iron single crystals are never perfect cleavages, even though
the metal can fail in a completely brittle manner. Thus, while a surface can be a macro-scopically ﬂat plane, observation under a microscope at even relatively low magniﬁcationshows a considerable amount of surface detail. A typical cleavage fracture surface is shownin Fig. 21.7. In this picture, the rectangular block pattern is caused by the intersection ofmechanical twins with the surface of cleavage. In cases such as this, it would appear thatthe fracture front moves across the specimen discontinuously, being impeded by the twinsthat form in front of it, with the crack having to be continuously renucleated on the farside of the twins in order to keep on moving.
When tested in tension at temperatures above 173 K, annealed iron single crystals
of all orientations are completely ductile. Failure occurs by slip mechanisms of the typeoutlined at the start of the present chapter. As the temperature is lowered below 173 K,the nature of the fracture becomes orientation-dependent, so that at 90 K a relatively large221Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 691

fraction of the crystals fail by brittle cleavage. The remainder still fail in a ductile fashion
by slip. The orientations that cleave are those in which the stress axis of the specimen lies
close to a /H20855100 /H20856direction.
In analyzing brittle fracture in iron, it is important to consider the effect of tem-
perature on the critical resolved shear stress (Fig. 21.8). In body-centered cubic met-
als, such as iron, the temperature-dependence of the critical resolved shear stress for
slip is very large, varying by a factor of almost eight in the temperature interval from
room temperature to 77 K. Both cleavage and twinning require nucleation, and21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 692
693 21.6 Propagation of Cleavage Cracks
the high stress levels needed to deform iron plastically at low temperatures favor
these nucleation processes.
Over the years a decided change in viewpoint has occurred with regard to how cleav-
age cracks form in polycrystalline metals. The original view was that nucleation was prob-ably due to interactions between slip dislocations. A number of mechanisms were suggestedto rationalize how this could occur. One of the ﬁrst, due to Zener, was proposed in 1948.
5
Another important dislocation mechanism for cleavage in iron was proposed by Cottrell in1958.
6However, at this time it is generally felt that the origin of a cleavage crack in a steel
is a carbide that cracked as a result of plastic deformation produced by the load applied toa specimen. Early evidence for this showed
7that cracked grain-boundary carbides could be
responsible for the start of cleavage cracks. It has also been shown that for two cracks in thesame grain-boundary carbide, only that in the thicker part of the carbide might be able topropagate into the matrix as a cleavage crack. This has been interpreted as showing that thelength of the crack in the carbide is critical to whether it can propagate or not, with thelarger carbide crack being able to satisfy the conditions for propagation and the smallercrack not. It has also been demonstrated
8that cleavage cracks can result from cracking of
the spheroidal carbide particles in a spheroidized cementite structure. On the basis of theseand other observations, the concept that cleavage cracks originate at fractured inclusions isnow well accepted.
21.6 PROPAGATION OF CLEAVAGE CRACKS
In elastic solids (cold glass), the strain energy that is released as a crack propagates is con-verted into the surface energy of the crack surfaces and the kinetic energy of the movingmaterial at the sides of the crack.
An additional energy term must be considered for the propagation of crystalline cleav-
age cracks. This term is that associated with the plastic deformation which usually accom-panies the motion of cracks through crystals. Low temperature and high strain rates tendto raise the yield points of metals and to suppress plastic deformation. The energy termassociated with plastic deformation, therefore, becomes less important the lower the tem-perature of testing and the higher the velocity with which the crack moves. In the follow-ing sections certain of the experimental aspects of these effects will be discussed. Moredetailed analysis can be found in other references.
9–11
Plastic deformation associated with a moving crack is most liable to occur just ahead
of the crack. The metal in this region is effectively in a state of very high uniaxial ten-sile stress, with the stress axis normal to the plane of the crack. A simple tensile stressof this type is equivalent to a set of shear stresses on planes at 45° to the tensile-stressaxis, as indicated in Fig. 21.9. Because these shear stresses are large, it is quite possibleto nucleate dislocation ahead of the crack on slip planes that are favorably oriented withrespect to the shear stress.
Gilman and his associates
12have reported some interesting work dealing with
plastic deformation during cleavage fracture, using single crystals of lithium fluoride,which is an ionic cubic solid similar to MgO in which dislocations can be readilyrevealed by a reliable etching technique. It has been observed that in this material,when a crack moves slowly or stops, dislocations are nucleated in advance of thecrack. Actually, there is a limiting velocity below which dislocations are nucleatedand above which no evidence of plastic deformation is to be found. The surface of acleaved LiF crystal is shown in Fig. 21.10. In this particular case, the crack slowed21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 693

This in turn, is equivalent to shear stresses ( τ)

formed an etch pit at each intersection of a dislocation with the surface. In Fig. 21.10,
the long array of closely spaced pits represent the dislocations that formed in front of
the crack when its velocity fell below the critical velocity for forming dislocations.
An interesting feature of the work on LiF is that the maximum velocity with which a
crack can move in this material has actually been measured and is 0.31 the velocity of
sound.12This compares quite favorably with the theoretical value for fracture in an elas-
tic material which is 0.38.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 694

FIG. 21.11 Production of a step in the cleavage
plane when a cleavage fracture intersects a
screw dislocationNow consider the effect of plastic deformation on cleavage crack propagation. When
slip takes place during the movement of a crack, energy is absorbed in nucleating and
moving dislocations. This energy comes at the expense of the elastic strain energy that
drives the crack. If the work to overcome plastic deformation is too large, the crack may
decelerate and stop, which implies that in those crystalline materials which cleave, a min-
imum velocity must be achieved before the crack can move freely. If the velocity is too
slow, then too much energy will be absorbed in the form of slip. The plastic deformation
term may well be one of the most important factors that make some metals incapable of
cleavage. In this regard, it is interesting to remember that face-centered cubic metals, with
their many equivalent slip systems, have not been observed to cleave.
In addition to the energy associated with the formation and growth of dislocations,
there is another way that dislocations absorb energy from a moving crack. The cutting of
dislocation lines by cracks involves energy losses. This is true particularly when the inter-
sected dislocations are in a screw orientation. When a cleavage fracture passes a screw dis-
location, the fracture surface receives a step whose height equals the Burgers vector of the
dislocation. The nature of the development of this step is shown in Fig. 21.11. As a crack
progresses, the steps that it obtains, due to its intersection with dislocations, tend to run
together. If the steps are from dislocations of the same sign, they combine to form larger
steps, whereas if they are from dislocations of opposite sign, they cancel.
The step produced on the cleavage plane by a single screw dislocation is, of course, too
small to be seen. However, if the crack intersects a large number of screw dislocations of
the same sign, then, by combining, steps can be developed large enough to be easily visi-
ble. As grown, LiF crystals often contain low-angle boundaries that have a twist compo-
nent. Such boundaries contain a cross-grid of closely spaced screw dislocations, all of the
same sign, and when a cleavage crack crosses one of these boundaries, large-sized steps
develop in the cleavage plane. An excellent example of this is shown in Fig. 21.12. Notice
how the steps progressively run together to form still steeper steps. The pattern that the
steps form on the cleavage surface is known as a river pattern . In general, the latter run nor-
mal to the crack front, and it is often possible to locate the point of origin of a cleavage
crack by following the river pattern back to its source.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 695
Chapter 21 Failure of Metals 696
FIG. 21.12 Cleavage steps resulting from the intersection of a cleavage
crack with a low-angle boundary containing a grid of screw dislocations
of the same sign. 250 /H11003(Gilman, J. J., Trans. AIME , 212310 [1958].)
The river pattern on brittle fracture surfaces can arise from a number of causes other
than the cutting of screw dislocations by a crack. Thus, if a cleavage crack is started, say by
a hammer and chisel, in such a manner that the crack is not strictly parallel to the cleav-age plane, the fracture must contain steps in order to accommodate the misalignment.River patterns are also observed on the surfaces of glass fractures. Since glass is normallyamorphous, the crack does not follow a crystallographic plane and dislocations in the nor-mal sense cannot exist.
There are several reasons why it is more difﬁcult for a fracture to move along a
stepped surface. First, a cleavage plane that contains a large number of steps has a largersurface area and therefore a larger surface-energy term. Second, the advance of the cracknot only involves separation of the crystal along cleavage plane segments, but also entailsthe continued growth of the surfaces of the steps, or small cliffs. Unless a secondary cleav-
age plane, or slip plane, is nearly normal to the surface of the primary cleavage plane, theformation of steps will involve what amounts to plastic tearing of metal in order to formthe surfaces of the step. A great deal of energy can be expended in doing this.
21.7 THE EFFECT OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES
As shown in the preceding section, a small-angle twist boundary (in a single crystal)adds to the difﬁculty of motion of a cleavage crack by introducing steps into the fractureplane. Grain boundaries in polycrystalline metals also impede the motion of cracks, andthere is sound evidence that the magnitude of the effect is much larger because it is21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 696
697 21.7 The Effect of Grain Boundaries
FIG. 21.13 A cleavage crack that stops at the boundaries of a single grain in a

and Cohen, M., Fracture , p. 91, The Technology Press and John Wiley and Sons,
Inc., New York, 1959.)possible to ﬁnd cleavage cracks in deformed polycrystalline tensile specimens that are no
larger than a grain diameter. Such a microcrack in a polycrystalline iron specimen isshown in Fig. 21.13.
Consider ﬁrst the case where the orientation difference between adjacent crystals
is more than a few degrees, but still not large. In this case, the cleavage planes in the twocrystals, while approximately aligned, still make a ﬁnite angle with each other. It is notpossible, under these conditions, for the fracture surface to pass smoothly through theboundary, and what probably happens is that a series of parallel cleavage surfaces are nucle-ated on different levels. The ultimate result is that the fracture surface develops a series ofsteps originating at the grain boundary. A typical example can be seen in Fig. 21.14.
In the average polycrystalline specimen, the misalignment between grains is larger
than that between the crystals in Fig. 21.14 and, in general, the fracture surface is muchmore irregular. A study
13of river patterns on the fracture surfaces of polycrystalline spec-
imens shows that the crack also propagates in an erratic fashion, sometimes moving in adirection opposite to the mean direction of movement. Evidence is also found for discon-tinuous crack propagation, meaning that failure is not merely by the movement of asingle-crack front, but that a number of crack segments form and then join together. Sincethe individual segments may not be on the same level, this usually involves plastic tearingbetween fracture surface segments.

21.8 THE EFFECT OF THE STATE OF STRESS
Both cleavage-crack nucleation and propagation are favored by high tensile stresses. On
the other hand, slip requires shear stress. When deformation occurs by slip, however, theapplied stresses tend to be relieved. In other words, it is difﬁcult to achieve large stresseswhen a metal deforms easily by slip. From these considerations we can conclude that anystress system capable of producing a combination of large tensile stresses and small shearstresses favors cleavage. The nature of the state of stress in a metal specimen is clearly animportant consideration in the fracture process.
In simple uniaxial tension, the stress can be viewed as equivalent to a set of shear
stresses oriented at 45° to the tensile stress axis. This relationship is shown in Figs. 21.15Aand 21.15B, where the tensile stress in one case is assumed horizontal and in the othervertical. If the two tensile stresses (at 90° to each other, as shown in these drawings) areapplied simultaneously to the same specimen, the shear-stress components will opposeeach other. In the two-dimensional case illustrated, it is clear that under a state of biaxialtension the shear stress in the material is reduced. Also, if a third tensile stress is appliednormal to the plane of the previously mentioned two stresses, and all tensile stresses areassumed equal, a state of hydrostatic tension will occur in which the material experiencesno shear stress whatsoever. The equivalent state of hydrostatic compression is wellknown—for example, a liquid under pressure.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 698

(B)Cross-section showing stress distributionFrom the above it can be concluded that whenever a metal specimen is tested under
conditions of biaxial or triaxial tension, slip that requires shear stress will tend to be
suppressed. Because of this, a high level of tensile stress can be attained and brittle frac-
ture by cleavage can be promoted. Conversely, if a metal specimen is pulled in tension
while immersed in a ﬂuid under pressure, the above conditions will be radically altered.
In this case, the applied tensile stress will be complemented by two compressive stresses,
having shear-stress components in the same direction as those of the applied tensile stress.
Deformation by slip in this case is highly favored, and very high ductilities in polycrys-
talline specimens have actually been attained in this manner.
An easy way of approximating the state of triaxial tension involves the placing of a
simple V-notch around the girth of a cylindrical tensile-test specimen. Figure 21.16 rep-
resents such a specimen. When it is loaded in tension, the reduced section at the notch
will be the ﬁrst position to yield. As this region elongates (in the direction of the applied21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 699

AIME , 218498 [1960].)stress), its natural tendency is to shrink in the horizontal plane. This, however, is resisted
by the metal lying above and below the notch that has not yet yielded. The metal in the
cross-section at the notch is thus placed under three tensile stresses: the vertical applied
stress and two induced horizontal stresses at 90° to each other.
21.9 DUCTILE FRACTURES
A completely brittle cleavage fracture will show sharp planar facets which reﬂect light,
while a completely ductile fracture presents a rough dirty-gray surface. The reason for the
latter is that a ductile fracture surface has a rough, irregular contour where much of the
surface is inclined sharply to the average plane of the fracture. Figure 21.17 shows a cross-
section through a ductile fracture that illustrates this characteristic of ductile fracture.
The failure of most ductile materials in the polycrystalline form occurs with a cup-and-
conefracture. The appearance of a typical specimen that has failed in this fashion is illustrated
in Fig. 21.18. This type of fracture is closely associated with the formation of a neck in a ten-
sile specimen. As indicated in Fig. 21.19, fracture begins at the center of the necked region
on a plane that is macroscopically normal to the applied tensile-stress axis. As deformation
progresses, the crack spreads latterally toward the edges of the specimen. Completion of the
fracture occurs very rapidly along a surface that makes an angle of approximately 45° with
the tensile-stress axis. In a perfect example, this ﬁnal stage leaves a circular lip on one-half
of the specimen and a bevel on the surface of the other half. Thus, one half has the appear-
ance of a shallow cup and the other half, a cone with a ﬂattened top.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 700

Rogers14has shown that in the necked region of a tensile-test specimen, small cavities
may form in the metal near the center of the cross-section before a visible crack is found.
The density of these pores depends strongly on the amount of deformation, and increases
with increasing deformation. Thus, Rogers observed that the number of pores per cm3was
of the order of 103greater in the region of the neck in his copper specimens than in a
position in the gage section well away from the neck. Coalescence of these cavities, as
a result of their growth under the applied stress, can be assumed to lead to the formation of
a ductile crack. Such a condition is actually shown in Fig. 21.20. There is good evidence that
in most15,16commercial metals, these internal cavities probably form at nonmetallic inclu-
sions. The manner in which inclusions nucleate pores may only be surmised, but certainly
hard brittle inclusions will impede the natural plastic ﬂow of the matrix surrounding them.
The belief that inclusions play a strong role in nucleating ductile fractures is supported by the
fact that extremely pure metals are much more ductile than those of slightly lower purity.
In a tensile test very pure metals often draw down to almost a point before they fracture.
Once a crack of the type shown in Fig. 21.20 has developed, it can propagate by the void-
sheet mechanism . This mechanism acts as follows. The stress concentration at the ends of the
crack localizes the plastic deformation in these regions into shear bands that make angles of
30° to 40° with the stress axis. The relationship of the shear bands to the crack is shown in21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 701

Fig. 21.21A. Because the deformation inside the bands is very intense, the bands become
ﬁlled with voids. Rogers has used the term void sheets to describe these bands at this point.
As the voids in these bands grow, they eventually impinge on each other, with the result
that a void sheet splits in two and the crack advances as indicated in Fig. 21.21B. The move-
ment of the crack down the void sheet changes the location of the end of the crack so that
new shear bands are formed, as shown in this diagram. At this point, the crack could
theoretically move along either of these two new bands, one of which is an extension of the
original band that split, while the other is inclined in the opposite direction. However, if the
crack continues to move forward in its original direction, it will move away from the speci-
men cross section at the center of the neck and into a region of decreasing stress. On the
other hand, if it moves into the other shear-band orientation, it moves back into the region
of maximum stress concentration. This is what normally occurs. Repetition of this process
acts to spread the crack across the specimen cross-section. In a ductile metal, the ﬁnal21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 702
703 21.9 Ductile Fractures
fracture can occur by several methods: one of these produces a cup and cone, and the other
a double cup. When the ﬁnal fracture occurs so as to form a typical cup-cone failure, as iniron, brass, or duraluminum, it is probable that the shear lip of the cup forms by the void-sheet mechanism. As the central fracture advances toward the surface, the specimen cross-section available to carry the load is progressively decreased. Eventually a condition isreached where the shear bands may extend to the surface. A catastrophic splitting of thesebands can then result in the shear lip. This case is illustrated in Fig. 21.22.
An interesting aspect of the fracture that occurs by the void-sheet mechanism is that
it produces a fracture surface with a characteristic appearance. At low magniﬁcations thesurface has a rough, spongy texture. However, at higher magniﬁcations, when observedby the scanning electron microscope, the true nature of the fracture surface can be seen.Such a photograph is shown in Fig. 21.23. The signiﬁcant feature of this photograph is the

cuplets corresponds to a pore that appeared in the void sheet. The fact that the cuplets are
oriented in a single direction is a direct result of the deformation that occurs in the shear
band. As indicated in Fig. 21.24A, this tends to elongate the pores in a direction approxi-
mately parallel to the tensile stress axis. When the void sheet splits, both of the resulting
fracture surfaces will contain cuplets, but they will point in opposite directions on the two
sides, as shown in Fig. 21.24B. A close examination of Fig. 21.23 will also reveal that small
holes have opened up at the bottom of some cups. These represent a connection with
other pores below the surface. These subsurface pores are clearly visible in Fig. 21.17,
which is a cross-section cut through a specimen that failed by the void sheet mechanism.
The stress axis was in the vertical direction. Notice the inclination of the fracture surface
characteristic of a void sheet.
Rogers17has proposed a mechanism for ductile-crack propagation which is quite
interesting and is based on the following concepts. It has been demonstrated that the rate
of plastic strain at the surface of a notch is larger than that at a distance inside the metal
away from the notch. For example, in Fig. 21.25 the metal should ﬂow more rapidly at
points athan at point b. This difference in strain rate may be quite large and depends on
the sharpness of the notch. We can conclude that during a tensile test, crystals lying at the
surface of the notch are deformed more rapidly than those in the interior of the specimen.
Rogers suggests that these crystals should deform like a single crystal that thins down to a
chisel edge and ruptures. Ductile-crack movement is thus pictured as the successive
pulling apart of crystals that ﬁnd themselves in succession at a notch surface.16This prop-
agation mechanism for a ductile crack is indicated schematically in Fig. 21.26.
The above method of crack propagation should hold for any ductile-crack extension
whether it is the inward movement of an external notch (or neck), or the outward
movement of an internal crack that starts at a void. It can also explain the ﬁnal stages of21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 704

a tensile fracture in which a double cup-cone fracture is obtained. This type of fracture is
shown schematically in Fig. 21.27 and is observed14in some ductile metals such as cop-
per, aluminum, silver, gold, and nickel. In this type of failure the crack also originates in
the center of the specimen and propagates by the void-sheet mechanism until a thin ring
of metal remains. This then fails by the progressive slipping apart of the grains, rather
than by the void-sheet mechanism. The result is two cups instead of a cup and cone.
21.10 INTERCRYSTALLINE BRITTLE FRACTURE
Fracture by cleavage is not the only form of brittle fracture that occurs in metals. Brittle
fracture can also occur in which the fracture passes along grain boundaries. In some
instances this type of fracture can be caused by grain-boundary ﬁlms of a hard-brittle
second phase, like that formed by bismuth in copper. In other cases it may not be due
to an actual precipitate, but to a concentration of solute in the metal close to crystal
boundaries. Why this concentration of solute should lower the cohesion across the
boundaries is not known.
21.11 BLUE BRITTLENESS
This is a phenomenon that has been recognized in steels for many years. Its name is a
result of the fact that it occurs in the temperature range (several hundred degrees centi-
grade above room temperature) where a blue oxide ﬁlm is formed on the surface of a steel
specimen. The term “blue brittleness” is somewhat of a misnomer, as the metal does not
become brittle in the normal sense. What actually happens is that the elongation in a ten-
sile test undergoes a minimum at the blue brittle temperature. This is shown in Fig. 21.28
for the case of commercial purity titanium.18However, the reduction in area of a tensile
specimen does not normally show a pronounced minimum at the blue brittle temperature.
This signiﬁes that the fracture is not brittle.
The blue brittle phenomenon is associated with dynamic strain aging (see
Sec. 9.15). More detailed analysis can be found in other references.20The interaction21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 705

between dislocations and impurity atoms acts to bring about the point at which neck-
ing starts in a tensile specimen at a relatively small strain and, once necking begins,
the strain becomes highly concentrated in the neck. Both effects act to reduce the
elongation that is obtained. That this phenomenon is closely associated with the
impurity atoms in the lattice is demonstrated in Fig. 21.29. This curve shows the elon-
gation as a function of temperature in high-purity titanium specimens. Notice that the
minimum observable in the corresponding curve for commercial purity titanium has
nearly disappeared.
21.12 FATIGUE FAILURES
Failures that occur in machinery parts are almost always fatigue fractures. When a metal
is subjected to many applications of the same load, fracture occurs at much lower stresses
than would be required for failure in a tensile test. The failure of metals under alternating
stresses is known as fatigue .
21.13 THE MACROSCOPIC CHARACTER OF FATIGUE FAILURE
A fatigue fracture always starts as a small crack which, under repeated applications of the
stress, grows in size. As the crack expands, the load-carrying cross-section of the specimen
is reduced, with the result that the stress on this section rises. Ultimately the point is
reached where the remaining cross-section is no longer strong enough to carry the load,
and the spread of fracture becomes catastrophic. Because of the manner in which the21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 706

Strain rate 3 /H1100310/H110024sec/H110021. (From the data of Ref. 18.)
fracture develops, the surfaces of a fatigue fracture are divided into two areas with dis-
tinctly different appearances, as is shown schematically in Fig. 21.30. In most cases, the
surface will have a polished or burnished appearance in the region where the crack grew
slowly. This texture arises because the metal surfaces of the crack rub against each other
as the specimen is deformed back and forth through each stress cycle. In the last stage,
when the specimen ﬁnally fractures, there is no rubbing action and the surfaces developed
at this time are rough and irregular. Because the latter area usually has a granular appear-
ance, an erroneous conclusion is frequently made relative to fatigue fractures, namely, that
the metal crystallized in service and thereby became embrittled.
In machinery components, the amplitudes of the stress cycles are not always of the
same magnitude. For example, consider an automobile drive shaft in which the stress
cycles are much larger during periods of fast acceleration than when the car moves at a
steady speed. Under variable stress amplitudes, the crack may stop spreading when the
stress is low and continue to grow when it rises. This alternation of periods of rapid growth
with periods of slow or no growth changes the degree of rubbing that the surfaces of the
crack undergo, with the result that the surface may attain a “clamshell” appearance. (See
Fig. 21.31.) Usually these ring-shaped markings on the fracture surface are concentric with
the origin of fracture and make possible its determination. Their existence on the fracture
surface of a metal object is also good evidence that the failed part fractured by a fatigue
mechanism. Other evidence in this regard is certainly the presence of the burnished and
smooth areas on the fracture surface. Finally, fatigue fractures are almost always charac-
terized by a lack of macroscopic plastic deformation at small distances from the immediate21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 707

FIG. 21.30 The surface of a fatigue fracture
usually shows two regions with characteristically
different aspects. One is smooth, or burnished,
corresponding to the slow spreading of the

belonging to the metal that failed as a result of
overload
fracture surface. In this respect, they resemble typical brittle fracture, and if a fractured
machinery part indicates that a large degree of plastic ﬂow occurred just prior to fracture,
it is usually indicative of the fact that failure occurred as a result of a temporary overload
rather than because of a uniform repeating load.
21.14 THE ROTATING-BEAM FATIGUE TEST
There are as many ways of running a test to measure fatigue as there are ways of apply-
ing repeated stresses to a metal. A specimen may be ﬁrst stretched in simple tension
and then the stress direction reversed so that the specimen is placed in compression.
Alternating the direction of twist in a torsion specimen is another type of repeated stress.
A relatively simple alternating stress is obtained by reversed bending. In some instances
fatigue has been studied by using combined stress loadings in which the obvious intent
was to subject the metal to conditions approaching those found in machinery parts. Since,
in many cases, machine elements and structures are not subjected to a loading that com-
pletely reverses the stress magnitude, tests are often run in which the specimen is given a
steady load, say in tension, and then an additional alternating load is superimposed on the
steady load.
A rotating beam is the type of fatigue specimen most generally used. One of its great-
est advantages is its relative simplicity.
Figure 21.32 shows schematically the basic components of one type of rotating beam
fatigue-testing machine. Its main element is a small high-speed electric motor capable of
running at a speed of 10,000 rpm. Speeds of this order do not greatly inﬂuence the data,
while they markedly reduce the time needed to obtain the necessary information. Next to
the motor is a large bearing, whose purpose is to relieve the motor of the large bending
moment that is applied to the specimen. The specimen proper is mounted in collets that
serve as grips. One collet is attached to the shaft driven by the motor while the other is
attached to a rotating lever arm. At the end of the latter is a small bearing, used to apply
a downward force to the lever arm. The application of this force places the small circular21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 708

(B)Fatigue-test specimen. Specimen is bent while it rotates. Any
point in the reduced middle section alternates between states of
tensile and compressive stress
cross-section specimen in a state of bending, so that its upper surface is in tension while
its lower surface is in compression. As the specimen is rotated by the action of the motor,
any given position on the surface of the specimen alternates between a state of maximum
tensile stress and a state of maximum compressive stress.
In making a test, one measures the number of cycles required to fracture the specimen
at a given stress. The stress, of course, is the maximum ﬁber stress developed on the speci-
men surface by the bending moment, which is created by hanging a weight on the end of
the lever arm. This stress can be easily computed in terms of the magnitude of the applied
weight, the length of the applied weight, the length of the lever arm, and the diameter of
the specimen at its minimum cross-section. If the maximum tensile stress applied by bend-
ing is only slightly less than that which will break the specimen in a simple tensile test, the
fatigue tester will run only a few cycles before the specimen fractures. Continued reduction
of the stress greatly increases the life of the specimen, so that in plotting fatigue-test results,
it is common practice to plot the maximum bending stress against the number of cycles to
fracture, using a logarithmic scale for the latter variable. Figure 21.33 shows the type of
curve that is usually obtained when the fatigue specimens are steel. This form of curve is
signiﬁcant because there is a stress below which the specimens do not fracture. At this par-
ticular stress, called the fatigue (or endurance) limit, the SN(stress-number of cycles) curve
turns and runs parallel to the Naxis. This is an important effect, for it implies that if a steel
is only loaded to a stress that is below its fatigue limit, no matter how many times the stress
is applied, it will not fail.
There appears to be a reasonably good correlation between the fatigue limit of a
steel and its ultimate tensile strength. The ratio of these two quantities, known as the
endurance ratio , is therefore of some value and usually falls in the range 0.4 to 0.5.
Since the yield strength of some steels is often close to one-half the ultimate strength,
the endurance limit and the yield stress are often approximately equal. It should not
be inferred, however, that the two are equal, because there is no good overall correla-
tion between the two quantities.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 709

Unlike steels, most nonferrous metals do not appear to have an endurance limit.
The SNcurves for these metals generally have the appearance shown in Fig. 21.34
where, with decreasing stress, the curve continues to fall steadily, although at a
decreasing rate. In speaking of the ability of nonferrous alloys to resist fatigue fail-
ure, one generally has to specify how many stress cycles the metal should withstand.
The stress that will cause fracture at the end of the specified number of stress alter-
ations, normally 107, is known as the fatigue strength of the metal, and is illustrated
in Fig. 21.34.
21.15 ALTERNATING STRESS PARAMETERS
The rotating beam machine in Fig. 21.32 produces a sinusoidal stress on the surface of the
fatigue specimen as shown in Fig. 21.35A. Note that the maximum tensile (positive) stress,
smax, equals the maximum compressive (negative) stress, sminduring a cycle. Thus, the
average or mean stress, sm, is zero. In practice, this is the type of alternating stress that an
axle or shaft may be subjected to when it rotates at a constant speed and constant load.
However, many engineering components are normally subjected to alternating stresses
where the mean stress is not zero. It is convenient to consider these stresses in terms of
two components: one is a mean or steady-state stress, sm, and the other is an alternating
stress, sa. Examples may be found in Fig. 21.35, where smis taken as positive so that it
lies above the zero stress axis. It is possible for the mean stress to be negative, but this is
not normally as signiﬁcant as when it is positive. Note that the alternating stress, sa, is
deﬁned by
sa/H11005(smax/H11002smin)/2/H11005/H9004 s/2 21.1
where smaxis the maximum stress in a cycle, sminthe minimum stress, and /H9004sthe alter-

where Ris the ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum stress in a cycle and Athe
ratio of the alternating stress to the mean stress. It should be noted that in computing the
Rratio, compressive stresses are considered negative.
The endurance limit of a metal tends to rise with an increase in the Rratio. This is
clearly shown in Fig. 21.36, where four S-Ncurves are plotted corresponding to the
Rratios /H110021.0, /H110020.3, 0, and /H110010.3 of the curves in Fig. 21.35. In these plots a constant stress
amplitude is assumed. Because of the interrelation between Rand the endurance limit, it
is obvious that the Rratio should be seriously considered in the design of components to
be used under conditions involving a nonzero mean stress.
It is interesting to note that almost a century ago, Goodman observed that there was a
relationship between the limiting stress range that a material can withstand without failing
and the mean stress sm. Since by deﬁnition sa/H11005/H9004 s\2, this signiﬁes a relation between the
alternating stress, sa, and the mean stress, sm. Actually, there is a well-known empirical equa-
tion21,22relating these two parameters of a material to its fatigue limit and ultimate stress:

However, an alternate proposal due to Gerber takes  a/H110052. As may be seen in Fig. 21.37,
the Goodman relation is linear and the Gerber parabolic. The Goodman form of Eq. 21.4
is normally preferred.2121Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 712

21.16 THE MICROSCOPIC ASPECTS OF FATIGUE FAILURE
It is customary to subdivide the fatigue process into three phases: crack initiation,
crack growth, and the ultimate catastrophic failure. We shall now consider crack
initiation.
It is almost universally agreed that fatigue failures start at the surface of a fatigue
specimen. This is true whether the test is made in a rotating-beam machine where
the maximum stress is always at the surface, or in a push-pull machine that gives a
simple tensile-compressive stress cycle. Furthermore, fatigue fractures start as small
microscopic cracks and, accordingly, are very sensitive to even minute stress raisers. It
is quite apparent, in light of these considerations, that a fatigue specimen will give
results that are representative of the metal tested only if its surface is free of defects.
Tool or grinding marks left on the surface make the formation of fatigue cracks easier
and may result in low apparent values of the fatigue limit or fatigue strength. A fun-
damental condition for making a fatigue test is that the surface of the specimen be
carefully polished.
In considering the problem of fatigue, the fact that fatigue failures have been observed
in specimens tested at 4 K is signiﬁcant. At this extremely low temperature, thermal
energy cannot make any appreciable contribution to the mechanism of fatigue fractures.
It can, therefore, be concluded that it is possible to have fatigue failure without thermal
activation. This means that while diffusion processes may be involved in some cases of
fatigue, they are not necessary to the formation of fatigue cracks.
Slip and twinning are plastic deformation processes that are believed to be able
to occur without thermal activation, and it is felt that they are strongly involved in
fatigue-failure mechanisms. Because fatigue failures are promoted by the presence of
minute stress raisers, the study of mechanisms of fatigue is best done on metals or
alloys that have a minimum of nonmetallic inclusions. (The role of nonmetallic21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 713

Hempel, M. R., Fracture , p. 376, The
Technology Press and John Wiley and Sons,
Inc., New York, 1959.)inclusions will be briefly discussed presently.) In most metals at temperatures close
to room temperature, slip seems to be the predominant factor in fatigue. At very low
temperatures, and with steel or iron specimens, mechanical twinning is probably of
importance.
A number of dislocation mechanisms have been proposed23,24to explain the
experimentally observed phenomena of fatigue. None of these mechanisms, how-
ever, is completely satisfactory; therefore, they will not be considered. Rather, a
brief discussion will be given of some of the experimental information that is now
available.
In polycrystalline metals, slip bands (groups of closely spaced and overlapping
slip lines) are observed to form on specimens prior to fracture. The nature of these
bands differs somewhat with the metal under consideration and with whether slip
takes place by single or multiple glide. Figure 21.38 shows that in the case of a par-
ticular low-carbon steel (0.09 percent C), slip lines first become visible at about 
the number of cycles required to fracture the specimens. It can also be seen that at
large values of N, the curve representing the first appearance of slip lies below that
for the fracture of the specimens. Slip can thus occur in this metal at stresses well
below the fatigue limit. This result has also been observed in other metals, but it is
not a universal effect, for there are also metals in which slip lines only appear when
the stress is equal to or above the fatigue limit.
During a fatigue test, slip lines appear first in those crystals of a specimen whose
slip planes have the highest resolved shear stress. As time goes on and the number
of stress cycles increases, the size and number of slip bands rises. The extent and
number of the slip bands are also a function of the amplitude of the applied stress;
higher stresses give larger values. Microscopic observations in polycrystalline copper
show that a periodical array of small, pit-shaped fatigue cracks form along slip bands
during the early stages of fatigue.25
In fatigue, the direction of the strain is reversed over and over again. The slip lines
that appear on the surface reflect this fact. When the strain is in a single basic direc-
tion, the slip steps that appear on a crystal surface have a relatively simple topogra-
phy. This is particularly true if only a single slip plane is active. The nature of these1

slip bands tend to group into packets or striations. The surface topography of these
striations is more complex and is indicated schematically in Fig. 21.39B. A basic com-
ponent of these striations consists of what are now generally called persistent slip bands
or PSBs. According to Ma and Laird,26in the copper single crystals that they studied,
a typical PSB contained about 5000 slip planes and had the shape of a lamella that
traverses an entire crystal. They also state that it is well accepted that PSBs are the
only sites where fatigue cracks can form in single crystals cycled at low and interme-
diate strain amplitudes because they are regions of highly concentrated strain. In addi-
tion, while PSBs are not the only possible crack nucleation sites in polycrystals, they
are important for furnishing nucleation sites in those strong alloys in which strain
localization occurs. It has further been observed27that the cracks that lead to failure
in copper form in the PSBs with the greatest local strain. As a result of their study on
copper single crystals oriented for single slip, Ma and Laird also observed that the plas-
tic strain amplitude in a PSB lamella is about 100 times larger than that in the sur-
rounding matrix. Consequently, there should exist a sharp change in the strain level
at a PSB-matrix interface. As a result, the longest cracks in their specimens were fre-
quently found at these interfaces. This is not an isolated observation since it has been
confirmed by other workers.26
The surface topography of the striations containing the PSBs is more complex
than that due to simple tensile loading shown in Fig. 21.39A. In the copper single21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 715

of the matrix and the PSBs. This implies that the bands shown in Fig. 21.39B should
consist of a set of PSBs with matrix lamellae in between them. Such striations are
often called macro-PSBs . Note that both ridges ( protrusions ) and crevices ( encroachments )
can form and it is possible to nucleate fatigue cracks in either one. Whether or not
protrusions or encroachments form in a particular specimen, or a specific grain of a
given specimen, is largely a function of crystal orientation. If the shear direction of a
striation is nearly normal to the surface, the formation of protrusions or encroach-
ments might be favored. However, if the slip direction is parallel to the surface, they
normally do not develop.
One consequence of dislocation movements during fatigue is that small localized
deformations called extrusions may appear in the PSBs. As may be seen in Fig. 21.40, an
extrusion is a small ribbon of metal that appears as if it had been extruded from the
surface of the metal. A second photograph showing a number of extrusions appears in
Fig. 21.41. Because extrusions are normally accompanied by cracks in the slip packets,
they may be of signiﬁcance in crack initiation. The inverse of extrusions are narrow21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 716

crevices called intrusions . The start of a crack in an intrusion may be seen in Fig. 21.42.
These surface disturbances (intrusions and extrusions) have a depth or height of the
order of about 10 mm.
21.17 FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH
With increasing numbers of cycles, the surface grooves deepen and the crevices andintrusions take on the nature of a crack. When this happens, Stage I of the crack-growthprocess has begun. Fracture initiation can start at a relatively early point in the fatiguelife of a specimen and, under favorable circumstances, Stage I crack growth can continuefor a large fraction of the fatigue life. If the specimen has a preferred orientation in whichneighboring grains have slip planes with nearly equivalent orientations, it is possible forslip-band cracks to extend across grains. Low applied stresses and deformation by slip ona single slip plane favor Stage I growth. On the other hand, multiple-slip conditions favorStage II growth. From a practical viewpoint, Stage I is normally of secondary importance

to Stage II. It should be noted that in addition to fracture initiation at slip planes, it is also
possible for cracks to form at grain boundaries or subgrain boundaries. Slip-band initia-
tion, however, appears to be of the greatest overall importance.
Stage I growth follows a slip plane, whereas Stage II growth does not have this crys-
tallographic character. In this case, the fracture conforms rather closely to fracture
mechanics conditions. Thus, if the applied stress favors plane-strain deformation, the frac-
ture surface in Stage II will follow a plane normal to the principal applied tensile stress. On
the other hand, in a thin plate with increasing size of the crack, the fracture surface tends
to shift into a plane at 45° to the specimen surface. The transition from Stage I to Stage II
is often induced when a slip-plane crack meets an obstacle such as a grain boundary.
Figure 21.43 is a schematic drawing illustrating the fracture process resulting from Stage I
and Stage II crack growth, followed by the ﬁnal catastrophic failure.
There is a large difference between the crack growth rates in Stages I and II. The
growth rate is much slower in Stage I, at about 0.1 nm per cycle, while in Stage II it may
be of the order of microns per cycle. This amounts to a difference of about 10,000 times in
the two stages. Because Stage I fractures tend to follow crystallographic slip planes, their
surfaces are normally much less distorted than those of Stage II fractures. In the latter case,
the fracture surfaces may also show ridges due to the fact that in Stage II, fatigue cracks
grow by steps; each incremental advance corresponds to one cycle of loading. Basically, the
crack moves ahead during the tension part of the cycle and then halts during its
compression part. There are several factors involved in this cyclic growth pattern which
can be easily understood in the case of a symmetrical tensile and compressive loading21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 718

a sinusoidal wave form; however, it could just as well be one of the other waveforms in

from each other and the crack tip advances. This is accompanied by plastic ﬂow in the
region around and in front of the advancing crack tip. This plastic ﬂow tends to blunt the
crack tip; that is, it opens up the crack at its extremity, which acts to limit its speed of
advance. This process continues until the tensile load reaches its maximum. Following
this, the load begins to fall and as it drops, the forward movement of the crack ceases. This
is followed by a change in the load from tension to compression. As the compressive load

collapse as a result of reversed plastic ﬂow in the material surrounding the crack tip. This
effectively sharpens the crack tip. This sharpening of the crack tip, in turn, aids the renu-
cleation of the crack when the load enters the tensile phase of the next cycle, upon which
the entire process is repeated.
A large amount of effort has been devoted to measuring the growth rate of fatigue
cracks.28–30The growth of a fatigue crack is relatively easy to follow in a sheet specimen,
and there is a great deal of data in the literature that shows a dependence of the growth
rate on the applied stress and the square root of the crack length. Normally this takes the
form of a power law in which the exponent is close to four. Stated in the form of an empir-
ical equation, this relationship is

21.18 THE EFFECT OF NONMETALLIC INCLUSIONS
Nonmetallic inclusions reduce the fatigue strength of metals. This fact is illustrated in
Fig. 21.45, which gives three SNcurves for a high-strength medium-carbon alloy steel,
AISI (4340). Steel specimens heat-treated to the same strength (ultimate strength 1590
MPa) were used to obtain each of the three curves. The upper and middle curves
correspond to vacuum-melted steel, while the lower curve corresponds to steel that was
air-melted. The inclusions in the vacuum-melted metal are smaller in size and much lessdc/H20862dN/H11005A(svc)421Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 720

numerous than in the air-melted steel. This is because gaseous elements are absorbed into
the air-melted steel, increasing the number of inclusions. Notice that the air-melted steelhas the lower fatigue limit.
The middle curve represents data for vacuum-melted specimens machined from
fabricated-steel stock in a direction transverse to the hot-rolling direction. The other twocurves are for specimens cut with their long axes parallel to the hot-rolling direction. Themiddle curve should be compared to that above it, which shows that the fatigue strengthor fatigue limit is less when specimens are cut transverse to the rolling direction. The rea-son for this is probably as follows.
When a metal is fabricated by rolling at a red heat, the inclusions tend to be deformed
and elongated in the rolling direction. In a specimen cut transverse to the rolling direction,the long axis of the inclusions lies in a plane perpendicular to the bending stress. On theother hand, in the longitudinal specimens, the long axis of the inclusions is parallel to thebending stress. In the former case, the cross-section of the inclusions normal to the stress islarger than it is in the latter case. This difference in the area of the inclusions normal to thestress is believed to be the biggest factor in the lower fatigue strength of transverse specimens.
Microscopic examinations of metals with high concentrations of nonmetallic inclu-
sions, or second-phase particles, show that small cracks form readily at inclusions.
31,32
These cracks may appear almost at the start of the test and well before visible slip lines areobserved. Not only do inclusions nucleate cracks, but also they aid in their propagation,for the cracks readily jump from one inclusion to the next.
21.19 THE EFFECT OF STEEL MICROSTRUCTURE ON FATIGUE
Over sixty years ago it was shown33that the ratio of the fatigue limit to the ultimate
strength (endurance ratio) was about 0.60 for steels with tempered martensitic struc-tures, and about 0.40 with austenitic or pearlitic structures. More recent work hasshown that the amount of martensite obtained during a quench is very important indetermining the fatigue properties of steel. Figure 21.46 shows the result obtained byquenching a number of different alloy steels. All specimens had the same carbon con-tent and were quenched at several different rates of cooling in order to obtain variouspercentages of martensite in the quenched metals. Each specimen was then tempered tothe same hardness (Rockwell C-36) and, following this, its fatigue limit was determined.The relationship between the fatigue limit and the amount of martensite obtainedon quenching is shown in Fig. 21.46. The drop in fatigue limit for even as little as 10 percent of structures other than martensite is quite noticeable. This drop constitutesanother important reason why steels in machinery parts are almost universally heat-treated before they are tempered, in order to obtain as nearly as possible a 100-percentmartensitic structure. Other examples of the pronounced inﬂuence of microstructuralvariables on the crack initiation and fatigue of other steels can be found elsewhere.

21.20 LOW-CYCLE FATIGUE
In recent years, increasing interest has developed in fatigue tests in which failure occursafter a relatively small number of cycles. This has been due in part to the fact that someengineering components, like the spring in an automobile self-starter, will probablynever be subjected in its lifetime to more than some tens of thousand of cycles. In otherwords, they do not need to be designed to undergo as many as 10
7cycles. Designing
such a part in terms of its expected life can reduce both its weight and cost. Another21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 721
Chapter 21 Failure of Metals 722
consideration is the large number of important engineering components that are
exposed to thermal cycling. This includes nuclear reactor pressure vessels, heat
exchanger tubes, and steam and gas turbine rotors and blades. During a heating and
cooling cycle, these items undergo large thermal expansions and contractions. In many
cases, the thermal expansions and contractions of these items are severely restrained
so that they undergo large cyclic strains during a heating and cooling cycle. The num-
ber of these cycles is normally relatively small so that the problems associated with
thermal cycling can be studied in the region where the total number of cycles to fail-
ure is small. Finally, in recent years, a renewed interest in the factors controlling the
nucleation growth of fatigue cracks has developed. In this regard, evidence has been
found 36–38supporting the view that the same mechanisms are involved in fatigue fail-
ures that occur at high stresses and a small number of cycles as occur at low stresses
and large numbers of cycles. At the same time, it is generally true that fatigue cracks
develop within the ﬁrst three to ten percent of a fatigue specimen’s life. However, in
crack growth, after nucleation and initiation (Stage I), there is a basic difference
between the fraction of time spent in Stage II growth in a specimen that fails after a
few cycles and one that fails after a large number. Normally, a much larger fraction of
the fatigue life is spent in Stage II crack growth in low-cycle fatigue. The opposite is
true in high-cycle fatigue, where a large fraction of the fatigue life is spent in Stage I.
This means that fatigue crack nucleation and growth can be studied more effectively
when fatigue failure occurs after a relatively few stress cycles. This has lent additional
motivation for the study of low-cycle fatigue (LCF). By general deﬁnition, fatigue stud-10040 50 60 70 80 90 100

ies involving fewer than 104cycles are grouped in the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) category,
while those requiring more than 104cycles fall in the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) classiﬁca-
tion. An additional classiﬁcation, called very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) or giga cycle fatigue
(GCF), has been introduced in recent years to describe fatigue cycles exceeding 107
cycles. Sadananda et al.39indicate that the fracture is surface crack initiated when the
cycle is less than 105, whereas in the VHCF or GCF range internal heterogeneous sites
nucleate the cracks.
Contributing to the current interest in low-cycle fatigue is the development in recent
years of a type of universal testing machine very well suited to this type of testing: the
closed-loop servohydraulic testing machine. This device can cyclically load a specimen ina number of different ways, including push-pull, in which a cylindrical specimen is alter-nately pulled in tension and pushed in compression. Unlike the rotating beam fatiguetester, it is not effectively limited to producing a simple sinusoidal cycle. The wave formmay be sinusoidal, triangular, trapezoidal, or square, as shown in Fig. 21.44. In addition,it is easy to change the value of the mean stress, s
m, with this instrument. A typical
closed-loop servohydraulic testing machine may operate at a maximum frequency of theorder of 80 Hz, which equals 4800 cycles per min., or close to half the maximum usedwith a rotating beam instrument. Low-cycle fatigue experiments do not normally require80 Hz, because at this high a frequency it will produce 10
4cycles in about 2 minutes.
Typical experimental LCF results published in the literature are usually obtained at afrequency of 20 Hz or less.
In a low-cycle fatigue test, the specimens are usually loaded well above their
yield stresses. For example, as pointed out in Sec. 21.14, the fatigue limit and theyield stress of a steel are roughly equivalent, while low-cycle fatigue is normally car-ried out well above the fatigue limit. The high stresses involved in LCF testing signifythat finite plastic strains must be developed during an alternating stress cycle. Thismeans that during a single cycle, the stress-strain curve follows a hysteresis loop offinite width, as shown schematically in Fig. 21.47. The loop develops as follows. Onthe initial loading, the specimen deforms elastically and linearly from point Oto
point C, the yield stress. After this, the stress-strain path is curved as the specimen
deforms plastically. At point D, tensile loading of the specimen is stopped and the
deformation of the specimen is reversed. At the start of this part of the cycle, thestress falls linearly until point Eis reached, corresponding to the yield stress in com-
pression. Note that this compressive yield stress is smaller than the initial yield stressin tension. This is a reflection of what is known as the Bauschinger effect ; namely, after
a specimen has been uniaxially loaded in one sense, the yield stress for loading in theopposite sense is normally smaller than the initial stress. The reversed part of thecycle is completed at point F. On reloading, the stress-strain curve follows path FGD
to complete the hysteresis loop. Note that the loop is nearly symmetrical. However,with increasing number of cycles the shape of the loop may change progressively. Ifthe specimen is subjected to loading cycles in which the stress range, /H9004s, is held con-
stant, then the strain range, /H9004/H9255, may either grow or decrease in size. Normally, how-
ever, LCF tests are carried out under the condition of a constant strain. This can beeasily accomplished with a servohydraulic closed-loop machine. Note that the strainrange /H9004/H9255consists of two parts: (1) the elastic strain component, /H9004/H9255
e, and (2) a plas-
tic strain component, /H9004/H9255p. These two strain components are shown at the top of the
drawing in Fig. 21.47. If the strain range is held fixed, the stress range may eitherincrease or decrease as the number of cycles increases. However, after the specimen21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:02 PM  Page 723

strain curve, such as that in Fig. 21.49, with a tensile stress-strain curve obtained under
similar conditions of temperature and material, signiﬁcant differences will normally be
found between the two curves.41

The Cofﬁn-Manson equation is a well-known LCF power law relation between the num-
ber of cycles to failure, Nf, (called the fatigue life ) and the plastic strain range /H9004/H9255p. It is the
result of the fact that these two parameters plot linearly on log-log coordinates. Three
examples of such plots are shown in Fig. 21.50. In this case, the data were obtained using
an a-bTi-Mn alloy.42The three curves correspond to three sets of specimens in which the
grain size of the alpha phase was varied. Plots such as these were the basis on which

where Cand bare material constants usually determined by experiment. Note the con-

A relation similar to Eq. 21.7 has also been observed between the elastic component
of the cyclic strain, /H9004/H9255eand the fatigue life, Nf, since a plot involving these two parameters
also tends to yield a straight line. This may be seen in Fig. 21.51 showing data obtained at
1033 K using specimens of the nickel superalloy, Inconel-617. Thus, we may write

cyclic strain amplitudes (half of the strain ranges) against 2 Nf, the number of load reversals
to failure, instead of Nf, the number of cycles to failure. This does not affect the basic func-
tional relations in Eqs. 21.7 and 21.8. In addition, in Fig. 21.51 the elastic strain amplitude
is plotted not only against the number of reversals to failure but also against the plastic and21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:03 PM  Page 726

21.22 CERTAIN PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF FATIGUE
Most fatigue failures in actual engineering structures are the result of macroscopic stress
raisers that were unintentionally incorporated in the object that failed. Any sharp cor-
ner or angle on the surface of an object that undergoes repeated stresses is a potential
danger point for a fatigue failure. This is especially true if the sharp corner lies in a
region in which the stress cycle places the metal in a state of tension during part of the
cycle. A well known example of an inadvertent fatigue failure is that of metal airplane
propellers that were originally stamped with the manufacturer’s name in the middle of
the blades. The grooves caused by the stamping served as stress raisers, causing early
fatigue failures. Keyways cut into shafts are frequently a source of fatigue damage. Even
holes drilled into a metal part can provide stress raisers at the sharp lip of the holes. The
V-notches at the bottom of threads cut on bolts are still another source of fatigue cracks.
Since fatigue failures originate at the surface of metallic specimens, strengthening
the surface generally improves the fatigue life. Surface hardening for this purpose can
be accomplished by a variety of methods. One method often used is shot-peening,
where the surface of a metal shaft or other object is bombarded with steel shot. This cold
works the surface layers and leaves them in a state of residual compressive stress with a
considerable improvement in fatigue properties. Surface hardening by carburizing or
nitriding may also be used to harden the surface of metal subjected to repeated stresses.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:03 PM  Page 727

PROBLEMS
21.1 (a) Make a list of the different types of fracture that
occur in single crystals.
(b) Now consider a polycrystalline metal. Indicate how
grain boundaries add to the fracture possibilities.
21.2 It is possible for zinc crystals to undergo very large
plastic strains at temperatures below room temperature.
This is not true in polycrystalline zinc, which normallyshows a very low ductility at sub-ambient temperatures.Give an explanation for this fact based on the mechanicalproperties of zinc.
21.3 S. S. Brenner, ( Jour. Appl. Phys ., 271484 [1956], has
reported that iron whisker single crystals may have a ten-
sile strength of 13,130 MPa. Assume that the ironwhiskers have a /H20855100 /H20856orientation; that is, a /H20855100 /H20856direc-
tion of the crystal lies along its central axis.
(a) Compute the magnitude of the shear stress on the
most highly stressed {110} /H20855111 /H20856slip systems when the
ultimate tensile stress is attained. How many of these slip
systems are there?
(b) The shear modulus, m, along a /H20855110 /H20856direction of a
{110} plane is 59,810 MPa. Compute the ratio of
τ
max/m.
(c) According to theoretical calculations, the maximum
shear strength of a crystal should be of the order of m/10
to m/30. How does the value obtained in (b) of this prob-
lem compare to the theoretical predictions?
(d) Now assume that one of the slip planes is ideally
oriented so as to have both uand fin the resolved
shear stress equation equal to 45 degrees, and compute
τmax/m.
(e) On the basis of these calculations, what can one
conclude about the occurrence of slip in the ironwhiskers? Does this signify anything about the perfec-tion of the crystal structure in the iron crystalwhiskers?
21.4 (a) It is now believed that inclusions in a metal tend
to promote both cleavage and ductile fracture. Explain.
(b) How does the shape of the inclusions affect the frac-
ture in fatigue specimens?(c) How does the multiaxial state of the stress affect frac-
ture in general?
21.5 (a) Both cleavage and twinning in iron are favored
by increasing the strain rate. Rationalize this statement.(b) Describe the development of a cup-and-cone fracture
in a tensile specimen.
21.6 A fatigue specimen is cyclic loaded as follows. (1)
The specimen is loaded in tension for 1 sec. at 1500
MPa/s, starting from a zero load; (2) it is then held atits maximum load for 1 sec; and (3) it is unloaded for 1sec. at /H110021500 MPa/s. This cycle is then repeated over
and over.
(a) Draw several cycles showing the cyclic loading pattern.
(b) Determine s
m, sa, R, and A.
21.7 (a) Draw the Goodman and Gerber lines for a 
steel whose ultimate stress is 1250 MPa and whose
fatigue limit (assuming completely reversed loading) is400 MPa.
(b) If this steel is loaded sinusoidally with an alternating
stress s
a/H11005150 MPa, what is the maximum stress that
can be applied to the specimen without its failing if the
Goodman line is taken as valid?
21.8 According to Hwang, et al., the constants in Eq. 21.6
corresponding to their 1255 K data in Fig. 21.48 are 
A/H110051920 MPa and n/H110050.31. Plot the stress range as a func-
tion of the plastic strain range for these data in the mannerof Fig. 21.49.
21.9 Determine the constants band Cof the Cofﬁn-
Manson equation using the 1.5 mdiameter alpha grain
size data of Saleh and Margolin in Fig. 21.50.21.10 With the aid of the Cofﬁn-Manson equation eval-
uated in Prob. 21.9, plot a curve of the Saleh and
Margolin data on /H9004/H9255
pversus log Nfcoordinates.
21.11 Figure 21.51 shows the strain amplitudes, /H9004/H9255e/2,
/H9004/H9255p, and /H9004/H9255tplotted against 2 Nf, the number of rever-
sals to failure, on double logarithmic coordinates.Determine equations for the three strain amplitudes asfunctions of 2 N
fthat are equivalent to Eqs. 21.8, 21.9,
and 21.10.
21.12 Plot the three equations obtained in Prob. 21.11
on the same figure using a computer and double loga-
rithmic coordinates. A comparison of your diagram withFig. 21.51 will then serve as a check on your Prob. 21.11results.21Ch21.qxd  11/6/08  4:03 PM  Page 728
