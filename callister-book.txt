In this tenth edition we have retained the objectives and approaches for teaching 
materials science and engineering that were presented in previous editions. These objec-
tives are as follows:
 • Present the basic fundamentals on a level appropriate for university/college 
students.
 • Present the subject matter in a logical order, from the simple to the more complex.
 • If a topic or concept is worth treating, then it is worth treating in sufficient detail 
and to the extent that students have the opportunity to fully understand it without 
having to consult other sources.
 • Inclusion of features in the book that expedite the learning process, to include the 
following: photographs/illustrations; learning objectives; “Why Study . . .” and “Materials of Importance” items; “Concept Check” questions; questions and problems; Answers to Selected Problems; summary tables containing key equations and equation symbols; and a glossary (for easy reference).
 • Employment of new instructional technologies to enhance the teaching and 
learning processes.

ONLINE RESOURCES
Associated with the textbook are online learning resources, which are available to both 
students and instructors. These resources are found on three websites: (1) WileyPLUS, (2) a Student Companion Site, and (3) an Instructor Companion Site.
WileyPLUS (www.wileyplus.com)
WileyPLUS is a research-based online environment for effective teaching and learning. It builds students’ confidence by taking the guesswork out of studying by providing them with a clear roadmap: what is assigned, what is required for each assignment, and whether assign-ments are done correctly. Independent research has shown that students using WileyPLUS will take more initiative so the instructor has a greater impact on their achievement in the classroom and beyond. WileyPLUS also helps students study and progress at a pace that’s right for them. Our integrated resources–available 24/7–function like a personal tutor, di-rectly addressing each student’s demonstrated needs by providing specific problem-solving techniques.
What do students receive with WileyPLUS?
They can browse the following WileyPLUS resources by chapter.

and, for each, its distinctive feature(s).
5. (a) Briefly define smart material/system.
(b)  Briefly explain the concept of nanotechnology 
as it applies to materials.
Please take a few moments and reflect on what your life would be like without all of 
the materials that exist in our modern world. Believe it or not, without these materials we wouldn’t have automobiles, cell phones, the internet, airplanes, nice homes and their furnishings, stylish clothes, nutritious (also “junk”) food, refrigerators, televisions, computers . . . (and the list goes on). Virtually every segment of our everyday lives is influenced to one degree or another by materials. Without them our existence would be much like that of our Stone Age ancestors.
Historically, the development and advancement of societies have been intimately 
tied to the members’ ability to produce and manipulate materials to fill their needs. In fact, early civilizations have been designated by the level of their materials development (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age).
1
The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number of materials, those that 
occur naturally: stone, wood, clay, skins, and so on. With time, they discovered techniques for producing materials that had properties superior to those of the natural ones; these new materials included pottery and various metals. Furthermore, it was discovered that the properties of a material could be altered by heat treatments and by the addition of other substances. At this point, materials utilization was totally a selection process that involved deciding from a given, rather limited set of materials, the one best suited for an application by virtue of its characteristics. It was not until relatively recent times that scientists came to understand the relationships between the structural elements of materials and their proper-ties. This knowledge, acquired over approximately the past 100 years, has empowered them to fashion, to a large degree, the characteristics of materials. Thus, tens of thousands of dif-ferent materials have evolved with rather specialized characteristics that meet the needs of our modern and complex society, including metals, plastics, glasses, and fibers.
The development of many technologies that make our existence so comfortable 
has been intimately associated with the accessibility of suitable materials. An advance-ment in the understanding of a material type is often the forerunner to the stepwise progression of a technology. For example, automobiles would not have been possible without the availability of inexpensive steel or some other comparable substitute. In the contemporary era, sophisticated electronic devices rely on components that are made from what are called semiconducting materials.1.1 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
1The approximate dates for the beginnings of the Stone, Bronze, and Iron ages are 2.5 million bc, 3500 bc, and 
1000 bc, respectively.

1.2 Materials Science and Engineering  •   3
Sometimes it is useful to subdivide the discipline of materials science and engineering 
into materials science and materials engineering subdisciplines. Strictly speaking, materials 
science involves investigating the relationships that exist between the structures and properties of materials (i.e., why materials have their properties). In contrast, materials engineering involves, on the basis of these structure–property correlations, designing or engineering the structure of a material to produce a predetermined set of properties. From a functional perspective, the role of a materials scientist is to develop or synthesize new materials, whereas a materials engineer is called upon to create new products or systems using existing materials and/or to develop techniques for processing materials. Most graduates in materials programs are trained to be both materials scientists and 
materials engineers.
Structure is, at this point, a nebulous term that deserves some explanation. In brief, 
the structure of a material usually relates to the arrangement of its internal components. Structural elements may be classified on the basis of size and in this regard there are several levels:
 • Subatomic structure—involves electrons within the individual atoms, their energies 
and interactions with the nuclei.
 • Atomic structure—relates to the organization of atoms to yield molecules or crystals.
 • Nanostructure—deals with aggregates of atoms that form particles (nanoparticles) 
that have nanoscale dimensions (less that about 100 nm).
 • Microstructure—those structural elements that are subject to direct observation using 
some type of microscope (structural features having dimensions between 100 nm 
and several millimeters).
 • Macrostructure—structural elements that may be viewed with the naked eye (with 
scale range between several millimeters and on the order of a meter).
Atomic structure, nanostructure, and microstructure of materials are investigated using microscopic techniques discussed in Section 4.10.
The notion of property deserves elaboration. While in service use, all materials are 
exposed to external stimuli that evoke some types of responses. For example, a speci-men subjected to forces experiences deformation, or a polished metal surface reflects light. A property is a material trait in terms of the kind and magnitude of response to a specific imposed stimulus. Generally, definitions of properties are made independent of material shape and size.
Virtually all important properties of solid materials may be grouped into six differ-
ent categories: mechanical, electrical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and deteriorative. For each, there is a characteristic type of stimulus capable of provoking different responses. These are noted as follows:
 • Mechanical properties—relate deformation to an applied load or force; examples 
include elastic modulus (stiffness), strength, and resistance to fracture.
 • Electrical properties—the stimulus is an applied electric fi  eld; typical properties in-
clude electrical conductivity and dielectric constant.
 • Thermal properties—are related to changes in temperature or temperature gradients 
across a material; examples of thermal behavior include thermal expansion and heat 
capacity.
 • Magnetic properties—the responses of a material to the application of a magnetic 
fi eld; common magnetic properties include magnetic susceptibility and magnetization.
 • Optical properties—the stimulus is electromagnetic or light radiation; index of re-
fraction and refl  ectivity are representative optical properties.1.2 MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
4  •  Chapter 1  /  Introduction
 • Deteriorative characteristics—relate to the chemical reactivity of materials; for 
example, corrosion resistance of metals.
The chapters that follow discuss properties that fall within each of these six classifications.
In addition to structure and properties, two other important components are in-
volved in the science and engineering of materials—namely, processing and performance. 
With regard to the relationships of these four components, the structure of a material depends on how it is processed. Furthermore, a material’s performance is a function of its properties.
We present an example of these processing-structure-properties-performance 
principles in Figure 1.1, a photograph showing three thin disk specimens placed over some printed matter. It is obvious that the optical properties (i.e., the light transmit-tance) of each of the three materials are different; the one on the left is transparent (i.e., virtually all of the reflected light from the printed page passes through it), whereas the disks in the center and on the right are, respectively, translucent and opaque. All of these specimens are of the same material, aluminum oxide, but the leftmost one is what we call a single crystal —that is, has a high degree of perfection—which gives rise to its 
transparency. The center one is composed of numerous and very small single crystals that are all connected; the boundaries between these small crystals scatter a portion of the light reflected from the printed page, which makes this material optically translu-cent. Finally, the specimen on the right is composed not only of many small, intercon-nected crystals, but also of a large number of very small pores or void spaces. These pores scatter the reflected light to a greater degree than the crystal boundaries and render this material opaque. Thus, the structures of these three specimens are different 
in terms of crystal boundaries and pores, which affect the optical transmittance proper-ties. Furthermore, each material was produced using a different processing technique. If optical transmitt ance is an important parameter relative to the ultimate in-service 
application, the performance of each material will be different.
This interrelationship among processing, structure, properties, and performance 
of materials may be depicted in linear fashion as in the schematic illustration shown in Figure 1.2. The model represented by this diagram has been called by some the central 
paradigm of materials science and engineering or sometimes just the materials paradigm. 
(The term “paradigm” means a model or set of ideas.) This paradigm, formulated in the 
1990s is, in essence, the core of the discipline of materials science and engineering. It describes the protocol for selecting and designing materials for specific and well-defined Figure 1.1  Three thin disk specimens of 
aluminum oxide that have been placed over a 
printed page in order to demonstrate their differences in light-transmittance characteristics. The disk on the left is transparent (i.e., virtually all light that is reflected from the page passes through it), whereas the one in the center is translucent (meaning that some of this reflected light is transmitted through the disk). The disk on the right is opaque —that is, none of the light 
passes through it. These differences in optical properties are a consequence of differences in structure of these materials, which have resulted from the way the materials were processed.

1.3 Why Study Materials Science and Engineering?   •  5
Why do engineers and scientists study materials? Simply, because things engineers design 
are made of materials. Many an applied scientist or engineer (e.g., mechanical, civil, chemi-cal, electrical), is at one time or another exposed to a design problem involving materials—for example, a transmission gear, the superstructure for a building, an oil refinery com-ponent, or an integrated circuit chip. Of course, materials scientists and engineers are specialists who are totally involved in the investigation and design of materials.
Many times, an engineer has the option of selecting a best material from the 
thousands available. The final decision is normally based on several criteria. First, the in-service conditions must be characterized, for these dictate the properties required of the material. Only on rare occasions does a material possess the optimum or ideal com-bination of properties. Thus, it may be necessary to trade one characteristic for another. The classic example involves strength and ductility; normally, a material having a high strength has only a limited ductility. In such cases, a reasonable compromise between two or more properties may be necessary.
A second selection consideration is any deterioration of material properties that 
may occur during service operation. For example, significant reductions in mechanical strength may result from exposure to elevated temperatures or corrosive environments.
Finally, probably the overriding consideration is that of economics: What will the fin-
ished product cost? A material may be found that has the optimum set of properties but is prohibitively expensive. Here again, some compromise is inevitable. The cost of a finished piece also includes any expense incurred during fabrication to produce the desired shape.
The more familiar an engineer or scientist is with the various characteristics and 
structure–property relationships, as well as the processing techniques of materials, the more proficient and confident he or she will be in making judicious materials choices based on these criteria.1.3  WHY STUDY MATERIALS SCIENCE

applications, and has had a profound influence on the field of materials.2 Previous to this 
time the materials science/engineering approach was to design components and systems 
using the existing palette of materials. The significance of this new paradigm is reflected in the following quotation: “. . . whenever a material is being created, developed, or produced, the properties or phenomena the material exhibits are of central concern. Experience shows that the properties and phenomena associated with a material are intimately related to its composition and structure at all levels, including which atoms are present and how the atoms are arranged in the material, and that this structure is the result of synthesis and processing.”

Throughout this text, we draw attention to the relationships among these four com-
ponents in terms of the design, production, and utilization of materials.

Paradigm of Materials Science and Engineering,” as represented by the following diagram:

The following case study illustrates one role that 
materials scientists and engineers are called 
upon to assume in the area of materials performance: analyze mechanical failures, determine their causes, and then propose appropriate measures to guard against future incidents.
The failure of many of the World War II Liberty 
ships
4 is a well-known and dramatic example of the 
brittle fracture of steel that was thought to be ductile.5 
Some of the early ships experienced structural dam-age when cracks developed in their decks and hulls. Three of them catastrophically split in half when cracks formed, grew to critical lengths, and then rapidly propagated completely around the ships’ girths. Figure 1.3 shows one of the ships that fractured the day after it was launched.
Subsequent investigations concluded one or more 
of the following factors contributed to each failure:
6
•  When some normally ductile metal alloys are 
cooled to relatively low temperatures, they be-come susceptible to brittle fracture—that is, they experience a ductile-to-brittle transition upon cooling through a critical range of temperatures. 
4During World War II, 2,710 Liberty cargo ships were mass-produced by the United States to supply food and 
materials to the combatants in Europe.
5Ductile metals fail after relatively large degrees of permanent deformation; however, very little if any permanent 
deformation accompanies the fracture of brittle materials. Brittle fractures can occur very suddenly as cracks spread 
rapidly; crack propagation is normally much slower in ductile materials, and the eventual fracture takes longer. For these reasons, the ductile mode of fracture is usually preferred. Ductile and brittle fractures are discussed in Sections 8.3 and 8.4.
6Sections 8.2 through 8.6 discuss various aspects of failure. 
1.4 Classification of Materials  •   7
9The term metal alloy refers to a metallic substance that is composed of two or more elements.Solid materials have been conveniently grouped into three basic categories: metals, 
ceramics, and polymers, a scheme based primarily on chemical makeup and atomic structure. Most materials fall into one distinct grouping or another. In addition, there are the composites that are engineered combinations of two or more different materials. A brief explanation of these material classifications and representative characteristics is offered next. Another category is advanced materials—those used in high-technology applications, such as semiconductors, biomaterials, smart materials, and nanoengi-neered materials; these are discussed in Section 1.5.
Metals
Metals are composed of one or more metallic elements (e.g., iron, aluminum, copper, titanium, gold, nickel), and often also nonmetallic elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) in relatively small amounts.
9 Atoms in metals and their alloys are arranged in a 1.4 CLASSIFICATION OF MATERIALSThese Liberty ships were constructed of steel that experienced a ductile-to-brittle transition. Some of them were deployed to the frigid North Atlantic, where the once ductile metal experienced brittle fracture when temperatures dropped to below the transition temperature.

•  The corner of each hatch (i.e., door) was square; 
these corners acted as points of stress concentra-tion where cracks can form.
•  German U-boats were sinking cargo ships faster 
than they could be replaced using existing con-struction techniques. Consequently, it became necessary to revolutionize construction methods to build cargo ships faster and in greater numbers. This was accomplished using prefabricated steel sheets that were assembled by welding rather than by the traditional time-consuming riveting. Unfortunately, cracks in welded structures may propagate unimpeded for large distances, which can lead to catastrophic failure. However, when structures are riveted, a crack ceases to propagate once it reaches the edge of a steel sheet.
•  Weld defects and discontinuities (i.e., sites where 
cracks can form) were introduced by inexperi-enced operators.Remedial measures taken to correct these prob-
lems included the following:
•  Lowering the ductile-to-brittle temperature of 
the steel to an acceptable level by improving steel quality (e.g., reducing sulfur and phosphorus im-purity contents).
•  Rounding off hatch corners by welding a curved 
reinforcement strip on each corner.
8
•  Installing crack-arresting devices such as riveted 
straps and strong weld seams to stop propagating cracks.
•  Improving welding practices and establishing weld-
ing codes.
In spite of these failures, the Liberty ship pro-
gram was considered a success for several reasons, the primary reason being that ships that survived failure were able to supply Allied Forces in the theater of operations and in all likelihood shortened the war. In addition, structural steels were developed with vastly improved resistances to catastrophic brit-tle fractures. Detailed analyses of these failures ad-vanced the understanding of crack formation and growth, which ultimately evolved into the discipline of fracture mechanics.
7This ductile-to-brittle transition phenomenon, as well as techniques that are used to measure and raise the critical 
temperature range, are discussed in Section 8.6.
8The reader may note that corners of windows and doors for all of today’s marine and aircraft structures are 
rounded.

very orderly manner (as discussed in Chapter 3) and are relatively dense in comparison 
to the ceramics and polymers (Figure 1.4). With regard to mechanical characteristics, these materials are relatively stiff (Figure 1.5) and strong (Figure 1.6), yet are ductile (i.e., capable of large amounts of deformation without fracture), and are resistant to fracture (Figure 1.7), which accounts for their widespread use in structural applications. Metallic materials have large numbers of nonlocalized electrons—that is, these electrons are not bound to particular atoms. Many properties of metals are directly attributable to these electrons. For example, metals are extremely good conductors of electricity (Figure 1.8) and heat, and are not transparent to visible light; a polished metal surface has a lustrous appearance. In addition, some of the metals (i.e., Fe, Co, and Ni) have desirable magnetic properties.

Furthermore, the types and applications of metals and their alloys are discussed in Chapter 11.
Ceramics
Ceramics are compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements; they are most fre-
quently oxides, nitrides, and carbides. For example, common ceramic materials include aluminum oxide (or alumina, Al
2O3), silicon dioxide (or silica, SiO2), silicon carbide (SiC), 
silicon nitride (Si3N4), and, in addition, what some refer to as the traditional ceramics —those 
composed of clay minerals (e.g., porcelain), as well as cement and glass. With regard to me-chanical behavior, ceramic materials are relatively stiff and strong—stiffnesses and strengths are comparable to those of the metals (Figures 1.5 and 1.6). In addition, they are typically very hard. Historically, ceramics have exhibited extreme brittleness (lack of ductility) and are highly susceptible to fracture (Figure 1.7). However, newer ceramics are being engineered to have improved resistance to fracture; these materials are used for cookware, cutlery, and even automobile engine parts. Furthermore, ceramic materials are typically insulative to the

more resistant to high temperatures and harsh environments than are metals and polymers. With regard to optical characteristics, ceramics may be transparent, translucent, or opaque (Figure 1.1), and some of the oxide ceramics (e.g., Fe
3O4) exhibit magnetic behavior.
Several common ceramic objects are shown in Figure 1.10. The characteristics, 
types, and applications of this class of materials are also discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.
Polymers
Polymers include the familiar plastic and rubber materials. Many of them are organic compounds that are chemically based on carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetallic ele-ments (i.e., O, N, and Si). Furthermore, they have very large molecular structures, often chainlike in nature, that often have a backbone of carbon atoms. Some common and familiar polymers are polyethylene (PE), nylon, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polycar-bonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), and silicone rubber. These materials typically have low densities (Figure 1.4), whereas their mechanical characteristics are generally dissimilar to those of the metallic and ceramic materials—they are not as stiff or strong as these © William D. Callister, Jr.

other material types (Figures 1.5 and 1.6). However, on the basis of their low densities, 
many times their stiffnesses and strengths on a per-mass basis are comparable to those of the metals and ceramics. In addition, many of the polymers are extremely ductile and pliable (i.e., plastic), which means they are easily formed into complex shapes. In general, they are relatively inert chemically and unreactive in a large number of en-vironments. Furthermore, they have low electrical conductivities (Figure 1.8) and are nonmagnetic. One major drawback to the polymers is their tendency to soften and/or decompose at modest temperatures, which, in some instances, limits their use.
Figure 1.11 shows several articles made of polymers that are familiar to the reader. 
Chapters 14 and 15 are devoted to discussions of the structures, properties, applications, and processing of polymeric materials.

Carbonated Beverage ContainersCASE STUDY 1 . 2
One common item that presents some interesting 
material property requirements is the container 
for carbonated beverages. The material used for this application must satisfy the following constraints: (1) provide a barrier to the passage of carbon dioxide, which is under pressure in the container; (2) be non-toxic, unreactive with the beverage, and, preferably, recyclable; (3) be relatively strong and capable of surviving a drop from a height of several feet when containing the beverage; (4) be inexpensive, includ-ing the cost to fabricate the final shape; (5) if opti-cally transparent, retain its optical clarity; and (6) be capable of being produced in different colors and/or adorned with decorative labels.
All three of the basic material types—metal 
(aluminum), ceramic (glass), and polymer (polyes-ter plastic)—are used for carbonated beverage con-tainers (per the chapter-opening photographs). All of these materials are nontoxic and unreactive with beverages. In addition, each material has its pros and cons. For example, the aluminum alloy is relatively strong (but easily dented), is a very good barrier to the diffusion of carbon dioxide, is easily recycled, cools beverages rapidly, and allows labels to be painted onto its surface. However, the cans are op-tically opaque and relatively expensive to produce. Glass is impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide, is a relatively inexpensive material, and may be recy-cled, but it cracks and fractures easily, and glass bot-tles are relatively heavy. Whereas plastic is relatively strong, may be made optically transparent, is inex-pensive and lightweight, and is recyclable, it is not as impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide as aluminum and glass. For example, you may have no-ticed that beverages in aluminum and glass contain-ers retain their carbonization (i.e., “fizz”) for several years, whereas those in two-liter plastic bottles “go flat” within a few months.
Composites
A composite is composed of two (or more) individual materials that come from the 
categories previously discussed—metals, ceramics, and polymers. The design goal of a composite is to achieve a combination of properties that is not displayed by any single material and also to incorporate the best characteristics of each of the component ma-terials. A large number of composite types are represented by different combinations of metals, ceramics, and polymers. Furthermore, some naturally occurring materials are composites—for example, wood and bone. However, most of those we consider in our discussions are synthetic (or human-made) composites.
One of the most common and familiar composites is fiberglass, in which small glass 
fibers are embedded within a polymeric material (normally an epoxy or polyester).
10 
The glass fibers are relatively strong and stiff (but also brittle), whereas the polymer is more flexible. Thus, fiberglass is relatively stiff, strong (Figures 1.5 and 1.6), and flexible. In addition, it has a low density (Figure 1.4).
Another technologically important material is the carbon fiber–reinforced polymer 
(CFRP) composite—carbon fibers that are embedded within a polymer. These materials are stiffer and stronger than glass fiber–reinforced materials (Figures 1.5 and 1.6) but more expensive. CFRP composites are used in some aircraft and aerospace applications, as well as in high-tech sporting equipment (e.g., bicycles, golf clubs, tennis rackets, skis/snowboards) and recently in automobile bumpers. The new Boeing 787 fuselage is pri-marily made from such CFRP composites.
Chapter 16 is devoted to a discussion of these interesting composite materials.
10Fiberglass is sometimes also termed a glass fiber–reinforced polymer composite (GFRP).Tutorial Video:
Composites
1.4 Classification of Materials  •   13
There is an alternative and more illustrative way of presenting property values 
by material type than was portrayed by Figures 1.4 through 1.8—that is, if we plot the 
values of one property versus those of another property for a large number of differ-ent types of materials. Both axes are scaled logarithmically and usually span several (at least three) orders of magnitude, so as to include the properties of virtually all materials. For example, Figure 1.12 is one such diagram; here logarithm of stiffness (modulus of elasticity or Young’s modulus) is plotted versus the logarithm of density. Here it may be noted that data values for a specific type (or “family”) of materials (e.g., metals, ce-ramics, polymers) cluster together and are enclosed within an envelope (or “bubble”) delineated with a bold line; hence, each of these envelopes defines the property range for its material family.
This is a simple, comprehensive, and concise display of the kind of information 
contained in both Figures 1.4 and 1.5 that shows how density and stiffness correlate with one another among the various kinds of materials. Charts such as Figure 1.12 may be constructed for any two material properties—for example, thermal conductivity versus electrical conductivity. Thus, a relatively large number of plots of this type are available given the possible combinations of pairs of the various material properties. They are

14  •   Chapter 1  /  Introduction
Materials utilized in high-technology (or high-tech) applications are sometimes 
termed advanced materials. By high technology, we mean a device or product that 
operates or functions using relatively intricate and sophisticated principles, includ-ing electronic equipment (cell phones, DVD players, etc.), computers, fiber-optic systems, high-energy density batteries, energy-conversion systems, and aircraft. These advanced materials are typically traditional materials whose properties have been enhanced and also newly developed, high-performance materials. Furthermore, they may be of all material types (e.g., metals, ceramics, polymers) and are normally expensive. Advanced materials include semiconductors, biomaterials, and what we may term materials of the future (i.e., smart materials and nanoengineered materials), which we discuss next. The properties and applications of a number of these advanced materials—for example, materials that are used for lasers, batteries, magnetic infor-mation storage, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and fiber optics—are also discussed in subsequent chapters.
Semiconductors
Semiconductors have electrical properties that are intermediate between those of electri-cal conductors (i.e., metals and metal alloys) and insulators (i.e., ceramics and polymers)—see Figure 1.8. Furthermore, the electrical characteristics of these materials are extremely sensitive to the presence of minute concentrations of impurity atoms, for which the con-centrations may be controlled over very small spatial regions. Semiconductors have made possible the advent of integrated circuitry that has totally revolutionized the electronics and computer industries (not to mention our lives) over the past four decades.1.5 ADVANCED MATERIALSoften referred to as “materials property charts,” “materials selection charts,” “bubble charts,” or “Ashby charts” (after Michael F. Ashby, who developed them).
11
In Figure 1.12, envelopes for three important engineering material families are in-
cluded that were not discussed previously in this section. These are as follows:
 • Elastomers—polymeric materials that display rubbery-like behavior (high degrees 
of elastic deformation).
 • Natural materials—those that occur in nature; for example, wood, leather, and cork.
 • Foams—typically polymeric materials that have high porosities (contain a large 
volume fraction of small pores), which are often used for cushions and packaging.
These bubble charts are extremely useful tools in engineering design and are used 
extensively in the materials selection process in both academia and industry.12 When 
considering materials for products, an engineer is often confronted with competing 
objectives (e.g., light weight and stiffness) and must be in a position to assess possible trade-offs among any competing requirements. Insights into the consequences of trade-off choices may be gleaned by using appropriate bubble charts. This procedure is demonstrated in the Materials Selection for a Torsionally Stressed Cylindrical Shaft  case 
study found in both the “Library of Case Studies” [which may be found in WileyPLUS or at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site)] and the “Mechanical Engineering Online Support Module” [which may be found in all digital version of the text or at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site) ].

design using these bubble charts.
1.5 Advanced Materials  •   15
Biomaterials
The length and the quality of our lives are being extended and improved, in part, due 
to advancements in the ability to replace diseased and injured body parts. Replacement implants are constructed of biomaterials —nonviable (i.e., nonliving) materials that are 
implanted into the body, so that they function in a reliable, safe, and physiologically satisfactory manner, while interacting with living tissue. That is, biomaterials must be biocompatible —compatible with body tissues and fluids with which they are in contact 
over acceptable time periods. Biocompatible materials must neither elicit rejection or physiologically unacceptable responses nor release toxic substances. Consequently, some rather stringent constraints are imposed on materials in order for them to be biocompatible.
Suitable biomaterials are to be found among the several classes of materials dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter—i.e., metal alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composite ma-terials. Throughout the remainder of this book we draw the reader’s attention to those materials that are used in biotechnology applications.
Over the past several years the development of new and better biomaterials has 
accelerated rapidly; today, this is one of the “hot” materials areas, with an abundance of new, exciting, and high-salary job opportunities. Example biomaterial applications in-clude joint (e.g., hip, knee) and heart valve replacements, vascular (blood vessel) grafts, fracture-fixation devices, dental restorations, and generation of new organ tissues.
Smart Materials
Smart (or intelligent) materials are a group of new and state-of-the-art materials now 
being developed that will have a significant influence on many of our technologies. The adjective smart implies that these materials are able to sense changes in their environ-
ment and then respond to these changes in predetermined manners—traits that are also found in living organisms. In addition, this smart concept is being extended to rather 
sophisticated systems that consist of both smart and traditional materials.
Components of a smart material (or system) include some type of sensor (which 
detects an input signal) and an actuator (which performs a responsive and adaptive function). Actuators may be called upon to change shape, position, natural frequency, or mechanical characteristics in response to changes in temperature, electric fields, and/or magnetic fields.
Four types of materials are commonly used for actuators: shape-memory alloys, 
piezoelectric ceramics, magnetostrictive materials, and electrorheological/magnetorheo-logical fluids. Shape-memory alloys are metals that, after having been deformed, revert to their original shape when temperature is changed (see the Materials of Importance box following Section 10.9). Piezoelectric ceramics expand and contract in response to an ap-plied electric field (or voltage); conversely, they also generate an electric field when their dimensions are altered (see Section 18.25). The behavior of magnetostrictive materials is 
analogous to that of the piezoelectrics, except that they are responsive to magnetic fields. Also, electrorheological and magnetorheological fluids are liquids that experience dramatic 
changes in viscosity upon the application of electric and magnetic fields, respectively.
Materials/devices employed as sensors include optical fibers (Section 21.14), piezoelec-
tric materials (including some polymers), and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS; Section 13.10).
For example, one type of smart system is used in helicopters to reduce aerodynamic 
cockpit noise created by the rotating rotor blades. Piezoelectric sensors inserted into the blades monitor blade stresses and deformations; feedback signals from these sensors are fed into a computer-controlled adaptive device that generates noise-canceling antinoise.
Nanomaterials
One new material class that has fascinating properties and tremendous technological promise is the nanomaterials, which may be any one of the four basic types—metals, 
16  •   Chapter 1  /  Introduction
cerami cs, polymers, or composites. However, unlike these other materials, they are not dis-
tinguished on the basis of their chemistry but rather their size; the nano prefix denotes that 
the dimensions of these structural entities are on the order of a nanometer (10−9 m)—as a 
rule, less than 100 nanometers (nm; equivalent to the diameter of approximately 500 atoms).
Prior to the advent of nanomaterials, the general procedure scientists used to 
understand the chemistry and physics of materials was to begin by studying large and 
complex structures and then investigate the fundamental building blocks of these struc-tures that are smaller and simpler. This approach is sometimes termed top-down science. However, with the development of scanning probe microscopes (Section 4.10), which permit observation of individual atoms and molecules, it has become possible to design and build new structures from their atomic-level constituents, one atom or molecule at a time (i.e., “materials by design”). This ability to arrange atoms carefully provides op-portunities to develop mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and other properties that are not otherwise possible. We call this the bottom-up approach, and the study of the properties of these materials is termed nanotechnology.
13
Some of the physical and chemical characteristics exhibited by matter may experi-
ence dramatic changes as particle size approaches atomic dimensions. For example, materials that are opaque in the macroscopic domain may become transparent on the nanoscale; some solids become liquids, chemically stable materials become combustible, and electrical insulators become conductors. Furthermore, properties may depend on size in this nanoscale domain. Some of these effects are quantum mechanical in origin, whereas others are related to surface phenomena —the proportion of atoms located on 
surface sites of a particle increases dramatically as its size decreases.
Because of these unique and unusual properties, nanomaterials are finding niches 
in electronic, biomedical, sporting, energy production, and other industrial applications. Some are discussed in this text, including the following:
 • Catalytic converters for automobiles (Materials of Importance box, Chapter 4)
 • Nanocarbons—fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene (Section 13.10) • Particles of carbon black as reinforcement for automobile tires (Section 16.2) • Nanocomposites (Section 16.16) • Magnetic nanosize grains that are used for hard disk drives (Section 20.11) • Magnetic particles that store data on magnetic tapes (Section 20.11)
Whenever a new material is developed, its potential for harmful and toxicological 
interactions with humans and animals must be considered. Small nanoparticles have 
exceedingly large surface area–to–volume ratios, which can lead to high chemical reactivities. Although the safety of nanomaterials is relatively unexplored, there are concerns that they may be absorbed into the body through the skin, lungs, and digestive tract at relatively high rates, and that some, if present in sufficient concentrations, will pose health risks—such as damage to DNA or promotion of lung cancer.
In spite of the tremendous progress that has been made in the discipline of materials 
science and engineering within the past few years, technological challenges remain, in-cluding the development of even more sophisticated and specialized materials, as well as consideration of the environmental impact of materials production. Some comment is appropriate relative to these issues so as to round out this perspective.
1.6 MODERN MATERIALS’ NEEDS
13One legendary and prophetic suggestion as to the possibility of nanoengineered materials was offered by Richard 
Feynman in his 1959 American Physical Society lecture titled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.”
Summary  •   17
A number of today’s important technological sectors involve energy. There is a 
recognized need to find new and economical sources of energy, especially renewable 
energy, and to use present resources more efficiently. Materials will undoubtedly play a significant role in these developments—for example, the direct conversion of solar power into electrical energy. Solar cells employ some rather complex and expensive materials. To ensure a viable technology, materials that are highly efficient in this con-version process yet less costly must be developed.
In conjunction with improved solar cell materials, there is also a marked need for 
new materials for batteries that provide higher electrical energy-storage densities than those presently available and at lower costs. The current cutting-edge technology uses lithium ion batteries; these offer relatively high storage densities, but also present some technological challenges.
Significant quantities of energy are involved in transportation. Reducing the weight of 
transportation vehicles (automobiles, aircraft, trains, etc.), as well as increasing engine op-erating temperatures, will enhance fuel efficiency. New high-strength, low-density struc-tural materials remain to be developed, as well as materials that have higher-temperature capabilities, for use in engine components.
The hydrogen fuel cell is another very attractive and feasible energy-conversion 
technology that has the advantage of being nonpolluting. It is just beginning to be im-plemented in batteries for electronic devices and holds promise as a power plant for automobiles. New materials still need to be developed for more efficient fuel cells and also for better catalysts to be used in the production of hydrogen.
Nuclear energy holds some promise, but the solutions to the many problems that 
remain necessarily involve materials, such as fuels, containment structures, and facilities for the disposal of radioactive waste.
Furthermore, environmental quality depends on our ability to control air and water 
pollution. Pollution control techniques employ various materials. In addition, materials processing and refinement methods need to be improved so that they produce less envi-ronmental degradation—that is, less pollution and less despoilage of the landscape from the mining of raw materials. Also, in some materials manufacturing processes, toxic substances are produced, and the ecological impact of their disposal must be considered.
Many materials that we use are derived from resources that are nonrenewable—that 
is, not capable of being regenerated, including most polymers, for which the prime raw material is oil, and some metals. These nonrenewable resources are gradually becoming depleted, which necessitates (1) the discovery of additional reserves, (2) the development of new materials having comparable properties with less adverse environmental impact, and/or (3) increased recycling efforts and the development of new recycling technologies. As a consequence of the economics of not only production but also environmental im-pact and ecological factors, it is becoming increasingly important to consider the “cradle-to-grave” life cycle of materials relative to the overall manufacturing process.
The roles that materials scientists and engineers play relative to these, as well as 
other environmental and societal issues, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 22.
SUMMARY
• Six different property classifications of materials determine their applicability: me-
chanical, electrical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and deteriorative.
• One important relationship in the science of materials is the dependence of a ma-
terial’s properties on its structural elements. By structure, we mean how the internal 
component(s) of the material is (are) arranged. In terms of (and with increasing) dimensionality, structural elements include subatomic, atomic, nanoscopic, micro-scopic, and macroscopic.Materials Science

• Three important criteria in materials selection are in-service conditions to which the 
material will be subjected, any deterioration of material properties during operation, and economics or cost of the fabricated piece.
• On the basis of chemistry and atomic structure, materials are classified into three 
general categories: metals (metallic elements), ceramics (compounds between me-tallic and nonmetallic elements), and polymers (compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetallic elements). In addition, composites are composed of at least two different material types.
• Another materials category is the advanced materials that are used in high-tech applica-
tions, including semiconductors (having electrical conductivities intermediate between those of conductors and insulators), biomaterials (which must be compatible with body tissues), smart materials (those that sense and respond to changes in their environments in predetermined manners), and nanomaterials (those that have structural features on the order of a nanometer, some of which may be designed on the atomic/molecular level).Classification of

T he photograph at the bottom of this page is of a 
gecko.
 Geckos, harmless tropical lizards, are extremely 
 fascinating and extraordinary animals. They have very sticky feet (one of which is shown in the third photograph) that cling to virtually any surface. This characteristic makes it possible for them to run rapidly up vertical walls and along the undersides of horizontal surfaces. In fact, a gecko can support its body mass with a single toe! The secret to this remarkable ability is the presence of an extremely large number of microscopically small hairs on each of their toe pads. When these hairs come in contact with a surface, 
weak forces of attraction (i.e., van der Waals forces) are established between hair molecules and molecules on the surface. The fact that these hairs are so small and so numerous explains why the gecko grips  surfaces so tightly. To release its grip, the gecko simply curls up its toes and peels the hairs away from the surface.
Using their knowledge of this mechanism of adhesion, scientists have developed several 
ultrastrong synthetic adhesives, one of which is an adhesive tape (shown in the second photo-graph) that is an especially promising tool for use in surgical procedures as a replacement for sutures and staples to close wounds and incisions. This material retains its adhesive nature in wet environments, is biodegradable, and does not release toxic substances as it dissolves during the healing process. Microscopic features of this adhesive tape are shown in the top photograph.

WHY STUDY Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding?
An important reason to have an understanding of 
interatomic bonding in solids is that in some instances, the type of bond allows us to explain a material’s properties. For example, consider carbon, which may exist as both graphite and diamond. Whereas graphite is relatively soft and has a “greasy” feel to it, diamond is one of the hardest known materials in nature. In addition, the electrical properties of diamond and graphite are dissimilar: diamond is a poor conductor of electricity, but graphite is a reasonably good conductor. These disparities in properties are directly attributable to a type of interatomic bonding found in graphite that does not exist in diamond (see Section 12.4).
Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Name the two atomic models cited, and note 
the differences between them.
2.  Describe the important quantum-mechanical 
principle that relates to electron energies.
3. (a)  Schematically plot attractive, repulsive, and 
net energies versus interatomic separation for two atoms or ions.(b)  Note on this plot the equilibrium separation 
and the bonding energy.
4. (a)  Briefly describe ionic, covalent, metallic, 
hydrogen, and van der Waals bonds.
(b)  Note which materials exhibit each of these 
bonding types.
Some of the important properties of solid materials depend on geometric atomic ar-
rangements and also the interactions that exist among constituent atoms or molecules. This chapter, by way of preparation for subsequent discussions, considers several fund amental and important concepts—namely, atomic structure, electron configurations 
in atoms and the periodic table, and the various types of primary and secondary intera-
tomic bonds that hold together the atoms that compose a solid. These topics are re-viewed briefly, under the assumption that some of the material is familiar to the reader.
Each atom consists of a very small nucleus composed of protons and neutrons and is encircled by moving electrons.
1 Both electrons and protons are electrically charged, the 
charge magnitude being 1.602 × 10−19 C, which is negative in sign for electrons and positive 
for protons; neutrons are electrically neutral. Masses for these subatomic particles are extremely small; protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, 1.67 × 10
−27 kg, 
which is significantly larger than that of an electron, 9.11 × 10−31 kg.
Each chemical element is characterized by the number of protons in the nucleus, 
or the atomic number (Z).2 For an electrically neutral or complete atom, the atomic 
number also equals the number of electrons. This atomic number ranges in integral units from 1 for hydrogen to 92 for uranium, the highest of the naturally occurring elements.
The atomic mass ( A) of a specific atom may be expressed as the sum of the masses of 
protons and neutrons within the nucleus. Although the number of protons is the same for atomic number (Z)2.1 INTRODUCTION
2.2 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTSAtomic Structure
1Protons, neutrons, and electrons are composed of other subatomic particles such as quarks, neutrinos, and bosons. 
However, this discussion is concerned only with protons, neutrons, and electrons.

all atoms of a given element, the number of neutrons ( N) may be variable. Thus atoms of 
some elements have two or more different atomic masses, which are called isotopes.  The 
atomic weight of an element corresponds to the weighted average of the atomic masses 
of the atom’s naturally occurring isotopes.3 The atomic mass unit (amu) may be used to 
compute atomic weight. A scale has been established whereby 1 amu is defined as 1
12 of 
the atomic mass of the most common isotope of carbon, carbon 12 (12C) (A  = 12.00000). 
Within this scheme, the masses of protons and neutrons are slightly greater than unity, and
 A≅Z+N (2.1)
The atomic weight of an element or the molecular weight of a compound may be speci-
fied on the basis of amu per atom (molecule) or mass per mole of material. In one mole 
of a substance, there are 6.022 × 1023 (Avogadro’s number) atoms or molecules. These 
two atomic weight schemes are related through the following equation:
1 amu/atom (or molecule) =1 g/mol
For example, the atomic weight of iron is 55.85 amu/atom, or 55.85 g/mol. Sometimes use of amu per atom or molecule is convenient; on other occasions, grams (or kilograms) per mole is preferred. The latter is used in this book.isotope

3The term atomic mass is really more accurate than atomic weight inasmuch as, in this context, we are dealing with 
masses and not weights. However, atomic weight is, by convention, the preferred terminology and is used throughout 
this book. The reader should note that it is not necessary to divide molecular weight by the gravitational constant.EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2.1
Average Atomic Weight Computation for Cerium
Cerium has four naturally occurring isotopes: 0.185% of 136Ce, with an atomic weight of 
135.907 amu; 0.251% of 138Ce, with an atomic weight of 137.906 amu; 88.450% of 140Ce, with 
an atomic weight of 139.905 amu; and 11.114% of 142Ce, with an atomic weight of 141.909 amu. 
Calculate the average atomic weight of Ce.
Solution
The average atomic weight of a hypothetical element M, AM, is computed by adding fraction-
of-occurrence—atomic weight products for all its isotopes; that is,
 AM=∑
i fiMAiM (2.2)
In this expression, fiM is the fraction-of-occurrence of isotope i for element M (i.e., the percentage-
of-occurrence divided by 100), and AiM is the atomic weight of the isotope.
 For cerium, Equation 2.2 takes the form
ACe=f136CeA136Ce+f138CeA138Ce+f140CeA140Ce+f142CeA142Ce
Incorporating values provided in the problem statement for the several parameters leads to
ACe=(0.185%
100)(135.907 amu) +(0.251%
100)(137.906 amu) +(88.450%

 +(0.11114)(141.909 amu)
=140.115 amu

Atomic Models
During the latter part of the nineteenth century, it was realized that many phenomena 
involving electrons in solids could not be explained in terms of classical mechanics. What followed was the establishment of a set of principles and laws that govern systems of atomic and subatomic entities that came to be known as quantum mechanics. An understanding of 
the behavior of electrons in atoms and crystalline solids necessarily involves the discussion of quantum-mechanical concepts. However, a detailed exploration of these principles is beyond the scope of this text, and only a very superficial and simplified treatment is given.
One early outgrowth of quantum mechanics was the simplified Bohr atomic model, 
in which electrons are assumed to revolve around the atomic nucleus in discrete orbitals, and the position of any particular electron is more or less well defined in terms of its orbital. This model of the atom is represented in Figure 2.1.
Another important quantum-mechanical principle stipulates that the energies of 
electrons are quantized —that is, electrons are permitted to have only specific values of 
energy. An electron may change energy, but in doing so, it must make a quantum jump either to an allowed higher energy (with absorption of energy) or to a lower energy (with emission of energy). Often, it is convenient to think of these allowed electron energies as being associated with energy levels or states. These states do not vary continuously with energy—that is, adjacent states are separated by finite energies. For example, allowed states for the Bohr hydrogen atom are represented in Figure 2.2 a. These energies are 
taken to be negative, whereas the zero reference is the unbound or free electron. Of course, the single electron associated with the hydrogen atom fills only one of these states.
Thus, the Bohr model represents an early attempt to describe electrons in atoms, in 
terms of both position (electron orbitals) and energy (quantized energy levels).
This Bohr model was eventually found to have some significant limitations because of 
its inability to explain several phenomena involving electrons. A resolution was reached with a wave-mechanical model,  in which the electron is considered to exhibit both wave-
like and particle-like characteristics. With this model, an electron is no longer treated as a particle moving in a discrete orbital; rather, position is considered to be the probability of an electron being at various locations around the nucleus. In other words, position is quantum mechanics

wave-mechanical models for the hydrogen atom. Both models are used throughout the course of this text; the choice depends on which model allows the simplest explanation.
Quantum Numbers
In wave mechanics, every electron in an atom is characterized by four parameters called 
quantum numbers.  The size, shape, and spatial orientation of an electron’s probability 
density (or orbital ) are specified by three of these quantum numbers. Furthermore, 
Bohr energy levels separate into electron subshells, and quantum numbers dictate the 
number of states within each subshell. Shells are specified by a principal quantum num-
ber n,  which may take on integral values beginning with unity; sometimes these shells 
are designated by the letters K, L, M, N, O, and so on, which correspond, respectively, quantum numberFigure 2.2  (a) The first three electron

and it only, is also associated with the Bohr model. This quantum number is related to 
the size of an electron’s orbital (or its average distance from the nucleus).
The second (or azimuthal) quantum number, l , designates the subshell. Values

Furthermore, electron orbital shapes depend on l. For example s  orbitals are spheri-
cal and centered on the nucleus (Figure 2.4). There are three orbitals for a p subshell 
(as explained next); each has a nodal surface in the shape of a dumbbell (Figure 2.5). 
Axes for these three orbitals are mutually perpendicular to one another like those of an x-y-z coordinate system; thus, it is convenient to label these orbitals p
x, py, and pz 
(see Figure 2.5). Orbital configurations for d  subshells are more complex and are not 
discussed here.
2.3 Electrons in Atoms  •   25
The number of electron orbitals for each subshell is determined by the third (or 
magnetic) quantum number, ml; ml can take on integer values between −l and +l, includ-
ing 0. When l  = 0, ml can only have a value of 0 because +0 and −0 are the same. This
corresponds to an s  subshell, which can have only one orbital. Furthermore, for l = 1, ml 
can take on values of −1, 0, and +1, and three p  orbitals are possible. Similarly, it can be 
shown that d subshells have five orbitals, and f  subshells have seven. In the absence of an 
external magnetic field, all orbitals within each subshell are identical in energy. However, 
when a magnetic field is applied, these subshell states split, with each orbital assuming a 
slightly different energy. Table 2.1 presents a summary of the values and relationships 
among the n , l, and ml quantum numbers.
Associated with each electron is a spin moment, which must be oriented either up 
or down. Related to this spin moment is the fourth quantum number, ms, for which two 
values are possible: +1
2 (for spin up)  and −1
2 (for spin down).
Thus, the Bohr model was further refined by wave mechanics, in which the intro-
duction of three new quantum numbers gives rise to electron subshells within each shell. A comparison of these two models on this basis is illustrated, for the hydrogen atom, in Figures 2.2a and 2.2b.
A complete energy level diagram for the various shells and subshells using the 
wave-mechanical model is shown in Figure 2.6. Several features of the diagram are worth noting. First, the smaller the principal quantum number, the lower the energy level; for example, the energy of a 1 s state is less than that of a 2s state, which in turn Figure 2.5

is lower than that of the 3 s. Second, within each shell, the energy of a subshell level in-
creases with the value of the l quantum number. For example, the energy of a 3d state is 
greater than that of a 3p, which is larger than 3s. Finally, there may be overlap in energy of a state in one shell with states in an adjacent shell, which is especially true of d and f 
states; for example, the energy of a 3d state is generally greater than that of a 4s.
Electron Configurations
The preceding discussion has dealt primarily with electron states —values of energy 
that are permitted for electrons. To determine the manner in which these states are filled with electrons, we use the Pauli exclusion principle, another quantum-mechanical 
concept, which stipulates that each electron state can hold no more than two electrons that must have opposite spins. Thus, s, p, d, and f subshells may each accommodate, 
respectively, a total of 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons; the right column of Table 2.1 notes the maximum number of electrons that may occupy each orbital for the first four shells.
Of course, not all possible states in an atom are filled with electrons. For most 
atoms, the electrons fill up the lowest possible energy states in the electron shells and subshells, two electrons (having opposite spins) per state. The energy structure for a sodium atom is represented schematically in Figure 2.7. When all the electrons occupy the lowest possible energies in accord with the foregoing restrictions, an atom is said to be in its ground state. However, electron transitions to higher energy states are possible, 
as discussed in Chapters 18 and 21. The electron configuration or structure of an atom 
represents the manner in which these states are occupied. In the conventional notation, the number of electrons in each subshell is indicated by a superscript after the shell–subshell designation. For example, the electron configurations for hydrogen, helium, and sodium are, respectively, 1 s
1, 1s2, and 1s22s22p63s1. Electron configurations for some 
of the more common elements are listed in Table 2.2.
At this point, comments regarding these electron configurations are necessary. 
First, the valence electrons are those that occupy the outermost shell. These electrons 
are extremely important; as will be seen, they participate in the bonding between atoms to form atomic and molecular aggregates. Furthermore, many of the physical and chemi-cal properties of solids are based on these valence electrons.
In addition, some atoms have what are termed stable electron configurations— that is, 
the states within the outermost or valence electron shell are completely filled. Normally, this corresponds to the occupation of just the s  and p  states for the outermost shell by a 
 total of eight electrons, as in neon, argon, and krypton; one exception is helium, which con-tains only two 1s  electrons. These elements (Ne, Ar, Kr, and He) are the inert, or noble, 
gases, which are virtually unreactive chemically. Some atoms of the elements that have unfilled valence shells assume stable electron configurations by gaining or losing electrons electron state

All the elements have been classified according to electron configuration in the periodic 
table (Figure 2.8). Here, the elements are situated, with increasing atomic number, in 
seven horizontal rows called periods. The arrangement is such that all elements arrayed 
in a given column or group have similar valence electron structures, as well as chemical 
and physical properties. These properties change gradually, moving horizontally across each period and vertically down each column.
The elements positioned in Group 0, the rightmost group, are the inert gases, which have 
filled electron shells and stable electron configurations.

are one and two electrons deficient, respectively, from having stable structures. The Group periodic table2.4 THE PERIODIC TABLE

stable or common isotopes.
4Two different group designation schemes are used in Figure 2.8, which appear at the top of each column. The con-
vention used prior to 1988 was to label each group with a Roman numeral, in most instances followed by an “A” or 
“B”. With the current system, devised by an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18, moving from with the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the inert gases). These numbers appear in parentheses in Figure 2.8.to form charged ions or by sharing electrons with other atoms. This is the basis for some 
chemical reactions and also for atomic bonding in solids, as explained in Section 2.6.

2.2VIIA elements (F, Cl, Br, I, and At) are sometimes termed the halogens. The alkali and the 
alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, etc.) are labeled as Groups IA and IIA, having, respectively, one and two electrons in excess of stable structures. The elements in the three long periods, Groups IIIB through IIB, are termed the transition metals, which have partially 
filled d electron states and in some cases one or two electrons in the next higher energy shell. 
Groups IIIA, IVA, and VA (B, Si, Ge, As, etc.) display characteristics that are intermediate between the metals and nonmetals by virtue of their valence electron structures.
As may be noted from the periodic table, most of the elements really come 
under the metal classification. These are sometimes termed electropositive elements, 
indicating that they are capable of giving up their few valence electrons to become positively charged ions. Furthermore, the elements situated on the right side of the table are electronegative —that is, they readily accept electrons to form negatively 
charged ions, or sometimes they share electrons with other atoms. Figure 2.9 displays electronegativity values that have been assigned to the various elements arranged in the periodic table. As a general rule, electronegativity increases in moving from left to right and from bottom to top. Atoms are more likely to accept electrons if their outer shells are almost full and if they are less “shielded” from (i.e., closer to) the nucleus.
In addition to chemical behavior, physical properties of the elements also tend to 
vary systematically with position in the periodic table. For example, most metals that reside in the center of the table (Groups IIIB through IIB) are relatively good conduc-tors of electricity and heat; nonmetals are typically electrical and thermal insulators. Mechanically, the metallic elements exhibit varying degrees of ductility —the ability to 
be plastically deformed without fracturing (e.g., the ability to be rolled into thin sheets). Most of the nonmetals are either gases or liquids, or in the solid state are brittle in nature. Furthermore, for the Group IVA elements [C (diamond), Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb], electrical conductivity increases as we move down this column. The Group VB metals (V, Nb, and Ta) have very high melting temperatures, which increase in going down this column.
It should be noted that there is not always this consistency in property variations within 
the periodic table. Physical properties change in a more or less regular manner; however, there are some rather abrupt changes when one moves across a period or down a group.electropositive

30  •   Chapter 2  /  Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding
Atomic Bonding in Solids
An understanding of many of the physical properties of materials is enhanced by a 
knowledge of the interatomic forces that bind the atoms together. Perhaps the principles of atomic bonding are best illustrated by considering how two isolated atoms interact as they are brought close together from an infinite separation. At large distances, interac-tions are negligible because the atoms are too far apart to have an influence on each other; however, at small separation distances, each atom exerts forces on the others. These forces are of two types, attractive ( F
A) and repulsive (FR), and the magnitude of 
each depends on the separation or interatomic distance ( r); Figure 2.10a is a schematic 
plot of FA and FR versus r. The origin of an attractive force FA depends on the particu-
lar type of bonding that exists between the two atoms, as discussed shortly. Repulsive forces arise from interactions between the negatively charged electron clouds for the two atoms and are important only at small values of r as the outer electron shells of the 
two atoms begin to overlap (Figure 2.10 a).
The net force F
N between the two atoms is just the sum of both attractive and 
repulsive components; that is,
 FN=FA+FR (2.3)2.5 BONDING FORCES AND ENERGIES

which is also a function of the interatomic separation, as also plotted in Figure 2.10a . 
When FA and FR are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, there is no net force—
that is,
 FA+FR=0 (2.4)
and a state of equilibrium exists. The centers of the two atoms remain separated by the 
equilibrium spacing r0, as indicated in Figure 2.10a. For many atoms, r0 is approximately 
0.3 nm. Once in this position, any attempt to move the two atoms farther apart is coun-teracted by the attractive force, while pushing them closer together is resisted by the increasing repulsive force.
Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the potential energies between two 
atoms instead of forces. Mathematically, energy ( E) and force (F) are related as
 
E=∫F dr (2.5a)
And, for atomic systems,
  EN=∫∞
rFN dr  (2.6)
  =∫∞
rFA dr+∫∞

  =EA+ER  (2.8a)
in which EN, EA, and ER are, respectively, the net, attractive, and repulsive energies for 
two isolated and adjacent atoms.5
Figure 2.10b  plots attractive, repulsive, and net potential energies as a function 
of interatomic separation for two atoms. From Equation 2.8a, the net curve is the 
sum of the attractive and repulsive curves. The minimum in the net energy curve cor-responds to the equilibrium spacing, r
0. Furthermore, the bonding energy for these 
two atoms, E0, corresponds to the energy at this minimum point (also shown in Figure 
2.10b ); it represents the energy required to separate these two atoms to an infinite 
separation.
Although the preceding treatment deals with an ideal situation involving only two 
atoms, a similar yet more complex condition exists for solid materials because force and energy interactions among atoms must be considered. Nevertheless, a bonding energy, analogous to E
0 above, may be associated with each atom. The magnitude of this bond-
ing energy and the shape of the energy–versus–interatomic separation curve vary from material to material, and they both depend on the type of atomic bonding. Furthermore, a number of material properties depend on E
0, the curve shape, and bonding type. Force–potential

32  •   Chapter 2  /  Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding
For example, materials having large bonding energies typically also have high melt-
ing temperatures; at room temperature, solid substances are formed for large bonding energies, whereas for small energies, the gaseous state is favored; liquids prevail when the energies are of intermediate magnitude. In addition, as discussed in Section 6.3, the mechanical stiffness (or modulus of elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shape of its force–versus–interatomic separation curve (Figure 6.7). The slope for a relatively stiff material at the r = r
0 position on the curve will be quite steep; slopes are shallower 
for more flexible materials. Furthermore, how much a material expands upon heating or contracts upon cooling (i.e., its linear coefficient of thermal expansion) is related to the shape of its E–versus–r curve (see Section 19.3). A deep and narrow “trough,” which typically occurs for materials having large bonding energies, normally correlates with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and relatively small dimensional alterations for changes in temperature.
Three different types of primary or chemical bond are found in solids—ionic, cova-
lent, and metallic. For each type, the bonding necessarily involves the valence electrons; furthermore, the nature of the bond depends on the electron structures of the constitu-ent atoms. In general, each of these three types of bonding arises from the tendency of the atoms to assume stable electron structures, like those of the inert gases, by com-pletely filling the outermost electron shell.
Secondary or physical forces and energies are also found in many solid materials; 
they are weaker than the primary ones but nonetheless influence the physical proper-ties of some materials. The sections that follow explain the several kinds of primary and secondary interatomic bonds.
primary bond
Ionic Bonding
Ionic bonding is perhaps the easiest to describe and visualize. It is always found in compounds composed of both metallic and nonmetallic elements, elements situated at the horizontal extremities of the periodic table. Atoms of a metallic element easily give up their valence electrons to the nonmetallic atoms. In the process, all the atoms acquire stable or inert gas configurations (i.e., completely filled orbital shells) and, in addition, an electrical charge—that is, they become ions. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is the classic ionic material. A sodium atom can assume the electron structure of neon (and a net single positive charge with a reduction in size) by a transfer of its one valence 3s  electron to a chlorine atom (Figure 2.11a ). After such a transfer, the chlo-
rine ion acquires a net negative charge, an electron configuration identical to that of argon; it is also larger than the chlorine atom. Ionic bonding is illustrated schematically in Figure 2.11b .
The attractive bonding forces are coulombic —that is, positive and negative ions, by 
virtue of their net electrical charge, attract one another. For two isolated ions, the attrac-tive energy E
A is a function of the interatomic distance according to

Here 𝜀0 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F/m), |Z1| and |Z2| are absolute values 
of the valences for the two ion types, and e  is the electronic charge (1.602 × 10−19 C). The 
value of A  in Equation 2.9 assumes the bond between ions 1 and 2 is totally ionic (see 
Equation 2.16). Inasmuch as bonds in most of these materials are not 100% ionic, the 
value of A  is normally determined from experimental data rather than computed using 
Equation 2.10.
An analogous equation for the repulsive energy is6
 ER=B
rn (2.11)
In this expression, B  and n are constants whose values depend on the particular ionic 
system. The value of n is approximately 8.
Ionic bonding is termed nondirectional —that is, the magnitude of the bond is equal 
in all directions around an ion. It follows that for ionic materials to be stable, all posi-tive ions must have as nearest neighbors negatively charged ions in a three-dimensional scheme, and vice versa. Some of the ion arrangements for these materials are discussed in Chapter 12.
Bonding energies, which generally range between 600 and 1500 kJ/mol, are 
relatively large, as reflected in high melting temperatures.
7 Table 2.3 contains bonding 
energies and melting temperatures for several ionic materials. Interatomic bonding is typified by ceramic materials, which are characteristically hard and brittle and, further-more, electrically and thermally insulative. As discussed in subsequent chapters, these properties are a direct consequence of electron configurations and/or the nature of the ionic bond.Repulsive energy—

6In Equation 2.11, the value of the constant B is also fit using experimental data.
7Sometimes bonding energies are expressed per atom or per ion. Under these circumstances, the electron volt (eV) is 
a conveniently small unit of energy. It is, by definition, the energy imparted to an electron as it falls through an electric 
potential of one volt. The joule equivalent of the electron volt is as follows: 1.602  × 10−19 J = 1 eV .Figure 2.11  Schematic representations of (a) the formation of Na+ and Cl− ions and (b) ionic bonding in sodium

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2.2
Computation of Attractive and Repulsive Forces between Two Ions
The atomic radii of K+ and Br− ions are 0.138 and 0.196 nm, respectively.
(a)  Using Equations 2.9 and 2.10, calculate the force of attraction between these two ions at 
their equilibrium interionic separation (i.e., when the ions just touch one another).
(b) What is the force of repulsion at this same separation distance?
Solution
(a) From Equation 2.5b, the force of attraction between two ions is
FA=dEA
dr
2.6 Primary Interatomic Bonds  •   35
Whereas, according to Equation 2.9,
EA=−A
r
Now, taking the derivation of EA with respect to r yields the following expression for the 
force of attraction FA:
 FA=dEA
dr=d(−A
r)
dr=−(−A
r2)=A
r2 (2.12)
Now substitution into this equation the expression for A (Equation 2.10) gives
 FA=1
4𝜋𝜀0r2(|Z1|e)(|Z2|e) (2.13)
Incorporation into this equation values for e and 𝜀0 leads to
FA=1
4𝜋(8.85×10−12 F/m)( r2) [|Z1|(1.602×10−19 C)][| Z2|(1.602×10−19 C)]
 =(2.31×10−28 N∙m2)(|Z1|)(|Z2|)
r2 (2.14)
For this problem, r is taken as the interionic separation r0 for KBr, which is equal to the 
sum of the K+ and Br− ionic radii inasmuch as the ions touch one another—that is,
 r0=rK++rBr− (2.15)
 =0.138 nm+0.196 nm
 =0.334 nm
 =0.334×10−9 m
When we substitute this value for r into Equation 2.14, and taking ion 1 to be K+ and ion 2 
as Br− (i.e., Z1 = +1 and Z2 = −1), then the force of attraction is equal to
FA=(2.31×10−28 N∙m2)(|+1|)(|−1|)
(0.334×10−9 m)2=2.07×10−9 N
(b)  At the equilibrium separation distance the sum of attractive and repulsive forces is zero 
according to Equation 2.4. This means that
FR=−FA=−(2.07×10−9 N)=−2.07×10−9 N
Covalent Bonding
A second bonding type, covalent bonding, is found in materials whose atoms have small 
differences in electronegativity—that is, that lie near one another in the periodic table. For these materials, stable electron configurations are assumed by the sharing of elec-trons between adjacent atoms. Two covalently bonded atoms will each contribute at least one electron to the bond, and the shared electrons may be considered to belong to both atoms. Covalent bonding is schematically illustrated in Figure 2.12 for a molecule of hydrogen (H
2). The hydrogen atom has a single 1s electron. Each of the atoms can 
acquire a helium electron configuration (two 1s valence electrons) when they share their single electron (right side of Figure 2.12). Furthermore, there is an overlapping of electron orbitals in the region between the two bonding atoms. In addition, the covalent covalent bonding
36  •   Chapter 2  /  Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding
bond is directional —that is, it is between specific atoms and may exist only in the direc-
tion between one atom and another that participates in the electron sharing.
Many nonmetallic elemental molecules (e.g., Cl2, F2), as well as molecules con-
taining dissimilar atoms, such as CH4, H2O, HNO3, and HF, are covalently bonded.8 
Furthermore, this type of bonding is found in elemental solids such as diamond (carbon), 
silicon, and germanium and other solid compounds composed of elements that are  located on the right side of the periodic table, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium antimonide (InSb), and silicon carbide (SiC).
Covalent bonds may be very strong, as in diamond, which is very hard and has a 
very high melting temperature, >3550°C (6400 °F), or they may be very weak, as with 
bismuth, which melts at about 270 °C (518°F). Bonding energies and melting tempera-
tures for a few covalently bonded materials are presented in Table 2.3. Inasmuch as electrons participating in covalent bonds are tightly bound to the bonding atoms, most covalently bonded materials are electrical insulators, or, in some cases, semiconductors. Mechanical behaviors of these materials vary widely: some are relatively strong, others are weak; some fail in a brittle manner, whereas others experience significant amounts of deformation before failure. It is difficult to predict the mechanical properties of covalently bonded materials on the basis of their bonding characteristics.
Bond Hybridization in Carbon
Often associated with the covalent bonding of carbon (as well other nonmetallic sub-stances) is the phenomenon of hybridization —the mixing (or combining) of two or more 
atomic orbitals with the result that more orbital overlap during bonding results. For example, consider the electron configuration of carbon: 1 s
22s22p2. Under some circum-
stances, one of the 2 s orbitals is promoted to the empty 2p orbital (Figure 2.13a), which 
gives rise to a 1s22s12p3 configuration (Figure 2.13b). Furthermore, the 2s and 2p orbitals 
can mix to produce four sp3 orbitals that are equivalent to one another, have parallel 
spins, and are capable of covalently bonding with other atoms. This orbital mixing is termed hybridization, which leads to the electron configuration shown in Figure 2.13 c; 
here, each sp
3 orbital contains one electron, and, therefore, is half-filled.
Bonding hybrid orbitals are directional in nature—that is, each extends to and over-
laps the orbital of an adjacent bonding atom. Furthermore, for carbon, each of its four sp
3 hybrid orbitals is directed symmetrically from a carbon atom to the vertex of a 
tetrahedron—a configuration represented schematically in Figure 2.14; the angle between each set of adjacent bonds is 109.5 °.
9 The bonding of sp3 hybrid orbitals to the 1s  orbitals 
of four hydrogen atoms, as in a molecule of methane (CH4), is presented in Figure 2.15.
For diamond, its carbon atoms are bonded to one another with sp3 covalent 
hybrids—each atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms. The crystal structure for diamond is shown in Figure 12.16. Diamond’s carbon–carbon bonds are extremely strong, which accounts for its high melting temperature and ultrahigh hardness (it is the hardest of all materials). Many polymeric materials are composed of long chains of carbon atoms that are also bonded together using sp
3 tetrahedral bonds; these chains 
form a zigzag structure (Figure 14.1b ) because of this 109.5 ° interbonding angle.Figure 2.12  Schematic representation of covalent 
bonding in a molecule of hydrogen (H2). H H

8For these substances, the intramolecular bonds (bonds between atoms in a molecule) are covalent. As noted in the 
next section, other types of bonds can operate between molecules, which are termed intermolecular.
9Bonding of this type (to four other atoms) is sometimes termed tetrahedral bonding.Tutorial Video:

Other types of hybrid bonds are possible for carbon, as well as other substances. 
One of these is sp2, in which an s orbital and two p orbitals are hybridized. To achieve 
this configuration, one 2s orbital mixes with two of the three 2p orbitals—the third p 
orbital remains unhybridized; this is shown in Figure 2.16. Here, 2 pz denotes the unhy-
bridized p orbital.10 Three sp2 hybrids belong to each carbon atom, which lie in the same 
plane such that the angle between adjacent orbitals is 120 ° (Figure 2.17); lines drawn 
from one orbital to another form a triangle. Furthermore, the unhybridized 2 pz orbital 
is oriented perpendicular to the plane containing the sp2 hybrids.
These sp2 bonds are found in graphite, another form of carbon, which has a 
structure and properties distinctly different from those of diamond (as discussed in Section 12.4). Graphite is composed of parallel layers of interconnecting hexagons. Hexagons form from planar sp
2 triangles that bond to one another in the manner 
presented in Figure 2.18—a carbon atom is located at each vertex. In-plane sp2 bonds 
are strong; by way of contrast, weak interplanar bonding results from van der Waals forces that involve electrons originating from the unhybridized 2p
z orbitals. The struc-
ture of graphite is shown in Figure 12.17.
10This 2pz orbital has the shape and orientation of the pz shown in Figure 2.5c. In addition, the two p orbitals found 
in the sp2 hybrid correspond to the px and py orbitals of this same figure. Furthermore, px, py, and pz are the three 
orbitals of the sp3 hybrid.

Metallic Bonding
Metallic bonding,  the final primary bonding type, is found in metals and their alloys. A rela-
tively simple model has been proposed that very nearly approximates the bonding scheme. 
With this model, these valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal. They may be thought of as belonging to the metal as a whole, or forming a “sea of electrons” or an “electron cloud.” The remaining nonvalence electrons and atomic nuclei form what are called ion cores, 
which possess a net positive charge equal in magnitude to the total valence electron charge metallic bonding(a)

per atom. Figure 2.19 illustrates metallic bonding. The free electrons shield the positively 
charged ion cores from the mutually repulsive electrostatic forces that they would other-wise exert upon one another; consequently, the metallic bond is nondirectional in charac-ter. In addition, these free electrons act as a “glue” to hold the ion cores together. Bonding energies and melting temperatures for several metals are listed in Table 2.3. Bonding may be weak or strong; energies range from 62 kJ/mol for mercury to 850 kJ/mol for tungsten. Their respective melting temperatures are −39°C and 3414 °C (−39°F and 6177 °F).
Metallic bonding is found in the periodic table for Group IA and IIA elements and, 
in fact, for all elemental metals.
Metals are good conductors of both electricity and heat as a consequence of their free 
electrons (see Sections 18.5, 18.6, and 19.4). Furthermore, in Section 7.4, we note that at room temperature, most metals and their alloys fail in a ductile manner—that is, fracture occurs after the materials have experienced significant degrees of permanent deformation. This behavior is explained in terms of a deformation mechanism (Section 7.2), which is implicitly related to the characteristics of the metallic bond.Figure 2.19  Schematic illustra-
tion of metallic bonding.

Secondary bonds, or van der Waals (physical) bonds, are weak in comparison to the 
primary or chemical bonds; bonding energies range between about 4 and 30 kJ/mol. 
Secondary bonding exists between virtually all atoms or molecules, but its presence may be obscured if any of the three primary bonding types is present. Secondary bonding is evidenced for the inert gases, which have stable electron structures. In addition, second-ary (or intermolecular) bonds are possible between atoms or groups of atoms, which themselves are joined together by primary (or intramolecular) ionic or covalent bonds.
Secondary bonding forces arise from atomic or molecular dipoles. In essence, 
an electric dipole exists whenever there is some separation of positive and negative portions of an atom or molecule. The bonding results from the coulombic attraction between the positive end of one dipole and the negative region of an adjacent one, as indicated in Figure 2.20. Dipole interactions occur between induced dipoles, between induced dipoles and polar molecules (which have permanent dipoles), and between polar molecules. Hydrogen bonding, a special type of secondary bonding, is found to exist secondary bond

between some molecules that have hydrogen as one of the constituents. These bonding 
mechanisms are discussed briefly next.
Fluctuating Induced Dipole Bonds
A dipole may be created or induced in an atom or molecule that is normally electrically symmetric—that is, the overall spatial distribution of the electrons is symmetric with respect to the positively charged nucleus, as shown in Figure 2.21 a. All atoms experience 
constant vibrational motion that can cause instantaneous and short-lived distortions of this electrical symmetry for some of the atoms or molecules and the creation of small electric dipoles. One of these dipoles can in turn produce a displacement of the electron distribution of an adjacent molecule or atom, which induces the second one also to  become a dipole that is then weakly attracted or bonded to the first (Figure 2.21b); this is one type of van der Waals bonding. These attractive forces, which are temporary and fluctuate with time, may exist between large numbers of atoms or molecules.
The liquefaction and, in some cases, the solidification of the inert gases and other 
electrically neutral and symmetric molecules such as H
2 and Cl2 are realized because of 
this type of bonding. Melting and boiling temperatures are extremely low in materials for which induced dipole bonding predominates; of all possible intermolecular bonds, these are the weakest. Bonding energies and melting temperatures for argon, krypton, methane, and chlorine are also tabulated in Table 2.3.
Polar Molecule–Induced Dipole Bonds
Permanent dipole moments exist in some molecules by virtue of an asymmetrical ar-rangement of positively and negatively charged regions; such molecules are termed 
polar molecules. Figure 2.22a shows a schematic representation of a hydrogen chloride 
molecule; a permanent dipole moment arises from net positive and negative charges that are respectively associated with the hydrogen and chlorine ends of the HCl molecule. polar moleculeFigure 2.20  Schematic illustration

2.7 Secondary Bonding or van der Waals Bonding   •  41
Polar molecules can also induce dipoles in adjacent nonpolar molecules, and a bond 
forms as a result of attractive forces between the two molecules; this bonding scheme is 
represented schematically in Figure 2.22 b. Furthermore, the magnitude of this bond is 
greater than for fluctuating induced dipoles.
Permanent Dipole Bonds
Coulombic forces also exist between adjacent polar molecules as in Figure 2.20. The asso-ciated bonding energies are significantly greater than for bonds involving induced dipoles.
The strongest secondary bonding type, the hydrogen bond, is a special case of polar 
molecule bonding. It occurs between molecules in which hydrogen is covalently bonded to fluorine (as in HF), oxygen (as in H
2O), or nitrogen (as in NH3). For each H F, H O, 
or H N bond, the single hydrogen electron is shared with the other atom. Thus, the hy-
drogen end of the bond is essentially a positively charged bare proton unscreened by any electrons. This highly positively charged end of the molecule is capable of a strong attrac-tive force with the negative end of an adjacent molecule, as demonstrated in Figure 2.23 for HF. In essence, this single proton forms a bridge between two negatively charged atoms. The magnitude of the hydrogen bond is generally greater than that of the other types of secondary bonds and may be as high as 51 kJ/mol, as shown in Table 2.3. Melting and boil-ing temperatures for hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, and water are abnormally high in light of their low molecular weights, as a consequence of hydrogen bonding.
In spite of the small energies associated with secondary bonds, they nevertheless are 
involved in a number of natural phenomena and many products that we use on a daily basis. Examples of physical phenomena include the solubility of one substance in another, surface tension and capillary action, vapor pressure, volatility, and viscosity. Common applications that make use of these phenomena include adhesives —van der Waals bonds form between 
two surfaces so that they adhere to one another (as discussed in the chapter opener for this chapter); surfactants —compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid and are found 
in soaps, detergents, and foaming agents; emulsifiers —substances that, when added to two 
immiscible materials (usually liquids), allow particles of one material to be suspended in another (common emulsions include sunscreens, salad dressings, milk, and mayonnaise); and desiccants —materials that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules (and remove 
moisture from closed containers—e.g., small packets that are often found in cartons of pack-aged goods); and finally, the strengths, stiffnesses, and softening temperatures of polymers, to some degree, depend on secondary bonds that form between chain molecules.Figure 2.22  Schematic

Water (Its Volume Expansion Upon Freezing)MATERIAL OF IMPORTANCE 2 . 1
Upon freezing (i.e., transforming from a liquid 
to a solid upon cooling), most substances expe-
rience an increase in density (or, correspondingly, a decrease in volume). One exception is water, which exhibits the anomalous and familiar expansion upon freezing—approximately 9 volume percent expan-sion. This behavior may be explained on the basis of hydrogen bonding. Each H
2O molecule has two 
hydrogen atoms that can bond to oxygen atoms; in addition, its single O atom can bond to two  hydrogen atoms of other H
2O molecules. Thus, for 
solid ice, each water molecule participates in four hydrogen bonds, as shown in the three-dimensional schematic of Figure 2.24a; here, hydrogen bonds are denoted by dashed lines, and each water mol-ecule has 4 nearest-neighbor molecules. This is a relatively open structure—that is, the molecules are not closely packed together—and as a result, the density is comparatively low. Upon melting, this structure is partially destroyed, such that the water molecules become more closely packed together (Figure 2.24b )—at room temperature, the average 
number of nearest-neighbor water molecules has increased to approximately 4.5; this leads to an in-crease in density.
Consequences of this anomalous freezing phe-
nomenon are familiar; it explains why icebergs float; why, in cold climates, it is necessary to add antifreeze to an automobile’s cooling system (to keep the engine block from cracking); and why freeze–thaw cycles break up the pavement in streets and cause potholes to form.

2.8 Mixed Bonding  •   43
Sometimes it is illustrative to represent the four bonding types—ionic, covalent, metal-
lic, and van der Waals—on what is called a bonding tetrahedron —a three-dimensional 
 tetrahedron with one of these “extreme” types located at each vertex, as shown in 
Figure 2.25a. Furthermore, we should point out that for many real materials, the atomic 
bonds are mixtures of two or more of these extremes (i.e., mixed bonds). Three mixed-
bond types—covalent–ionic, covalent–metallic, and metallic–ionic—are also included on edges of this tetrahedron; we now discuss each of them.
For mixed covalent–ionic bonds, there is some ionic character to most covalent bonds 
and some covalent character to ionic ones. As such, there is a continuum between these two extreme bond types. In Figure 2.25a , this type of bond is represented between the ionic and 
covalent bonding vertices. The degree of either bond type depends on the relative positions of the constituent atoms in the periodic table (see Figure 2.8) or the difference in their elec-tronegativities (see Figure 2.9). The wider the separation (both horizontally—relative to Group IVA—and vertically) from the lower left to the upper right corner (i.e., the greater the difference in electronegativity), the more ionic is the bond. Conversely, the closer the atoms are together (i.e., the smaller the difference in electronegativity), the greater is the degree of covalency. Percent ionic character (%IC) of a bond between elements A and B (A being the most electronegative) may be approximated by the expression
 %IC =
{1−exp[−(0.25)( XA−XB)2]}×100 (2.16)
where XA and XB are the electronegativities for the respective elements.
Another type of mixed bond is found for some elements in Groups IIIA, IVA, and 
VA of the periodic table (viz., B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, Po, and At). Interatomic bonds for 
these elements are mixtures of metallic and covalent, as noted on Figure 2.25 a. These 
materials are called the metalloids or semi-metals, and their properties are intermedi-
ate between the metals and nonmetals. In addition, for Group IV elements, there is a gradual transition from covalent to metallic bonding as one moves vertically down this column—for example, bonding in carbon (diamond) is purely covalent, whereas for tin and lead, bonding is predominantly metallic.
Mixed metallic–ionic bonds are observed for compounds composed of two metals 
when there is a significant difference between their electronegativities. This means that 2.8 MIXED BONDING

some electron transfer is associated with the bond inasmuch as it has an ionic compo-
nent. Furthermore, the larger this electronegativity difference, the greater the degree of ionicity. For example, there is little ionic character to the titanium–aluminum bond for the intermetallic compound TiAl
3 because electronegativities of both Al and Ti are the 
same (1.5; see Figure 2.9). However, a much greater degree of ionic character is present for AuCu
3; the electronegativity difference for copper and gold is 0.5.
EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2.3
Calculation of the Percent Ionic Character for the C-H Bond
Compute the percent ionic character (%IC) of the interatomic bond that forms between carbon and hydrogen.
Solution
The %IC of a bond between two atoms/ions, A and B (A being the more electronegative), is a 
function of their electronegativities X
A and XB, according to Equation 2.16. The electronega-
tivities for C and H (see Figure 2.9) are XC = 2.5 and XH = 2.1. Therefore, the %IC is
 %IC={1−exp[−(0.25)( XC−XH)2]}×100
 ={1−exp[−(0.25)(2.5−2.1)2]}×100
 =3.9%
Thus the C H atomic bond is primarily covalent (96.1%).
Many common molecules are composed of groups of atoms bound together by strong covalent bonds, including elemental diatomic molecules (F
2, O2, H2, etc.), as well as a 
host of compounds (H2O, CO2, HNO3, C6H6, CH4, etc.). In the condensed liquid and 
solid states, bonds between molecules are weak secondary ones. Consequently, mo-lecular materials have relatively low melting and boiling temperatures. Most materials that have small molecules composed of a few atoms are gases at ordinary, or ambient, temperatures and pressures. However, many modern polymers, being molecular materi-als composed of extremely large molecules, exist as solids; some of their properties are strongly dependent on the presence of van der Waals and hydrogen secondary bonds.2.9 MOLECULES
In previous discussions of this chapter, some correlations have been drawn between bond-ing type and material classification—namely, ionic bonding (ceramics), covalent bonding (polymers), metallic bonding (metals), and van der Waals bonding (molecular solids). We summarized these correlations in the material-type tetrahedron shown in Figure 2.25 b—
the bonding tetrahedron of Figure 2.25a , on which is superimposed the bonding location/
region typified by each of the four material classes.
11 Also included are those materials 
having mixed bonding: intermetallics and semi-metals. Mixed ionic–covalent bonding for ceramics is also noted. Furthermore, the predominant bonding type for semiconducting materials is covalent, with the possibility of an ionic contribution.2.10  BONDING TYPE-MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION 
CORRELATIONS
11Although most atoms in polymer molecules are covalently bonded, some van der Waals bonding is normally 
 present. We chose not to include van der Waals bonds for polymers because they (van der Waals) are intermolecular 
(i.e., between molecules) as opposed to intramolecular (within molecules) and not the principal bonding type.
Summary  •   45
SUMMARY
• The two atomic models are Bohr and wave mechanical. Whereas the Bohr model 
assumes electrons to be particles orbiting the nucleus in discrete paths, in wave me-
chanics we consider them to be wavelike and treat electron position in terms of a probability distribution.
• The energies of electrons are quantized —that is, only specific values of energy are 
 allowed.
• The four electron quantum numbers are n, l, m
l, and ms. They specify, respectively, 
electron orbital size, orbital shape, number of electron orbitals, and spin moment.
• According to the Pauli exclusion principle, each electron state can accommodate no 
more than two electrons, which must have opposite spins.
• Elements in each of the columns (or groups) of the periodic table have distinctive 
electron configurations. For example:
Group 0 elements (the inert gases) have filled electron shells.
Group IA elements (the alkali metals) have one electron greater than a filled 
electron shell.
• Bonding force and bonding energy are related to one another according to Equa          -
tions 2.5a and 2.5b.
• Attractive, repulsive, and net energies for two atoms or ions depend on interatomic 
separation per the schematic plot of Figure 2.10 b.
• For ionic bonds, electrically charged ions are formed by the transference of valence 
electrons from one atom type to another.
• There is a sharing of valence electrons between adjacent atoms when bonding is 
covalent.
• Electron orbitals for some covalent bonds may overlap or hybridize. Hybridization of 
s and p orbitals to form sp3 and sp2 orbitals in carbon was discussed. Configurations 
of these hybrid orbitals were also noted.
• With metallic bonding, the valence electrons form a “sea of electrons” that is uni-
formly dispersed around the metal ion cores and acts as a form of glue for them.
• Relatively weak van der Waals bonds result from attractive forces between electric 
dipoles, which may be induced or permanent.
• For hydrogen bonding, highly polar molecules form when hydrogen covalently bonds 
to a nonmetallic element such as fluorine.
• In addition to van der Waals bonding and the three primary bonding types, covalent–
ionic, covalent–metallic, and metallic–ionic mixed bonds exist.
• The percent ionic character (%IC) of a bond between two elements (A and B) 
 depends on their electronegativities (X ’s) according to Equation 2.16.

Chapter 2 was concerned primarily with the various types of atomic bonding, which are 
determined by the electron structures of the individual atoms. The present discussion is devoted to the next level of the structure of materials, specifically, to some of the arrangements that may be assumed by atoms in the solid state. Within this framework, concepts of crystallinity and noncrystallinity are introduced. For crystalline solids, the notion of crystal structure is presented, specified in terms of a unit cell. The three com-mon crystal structures found in metals are then detailed, along with the scheme by which crystallographic points, directions, and planes are expressed. Single crystals, polycrys-talline materials, and noncrystalline materials are considered. Another section of this chapter briefly describes how crystal structures are determined experimentally using x-ray diffraction techniques.3.1 INTRODUCTION
Solid materials may be classified according to the regularity with which atoms or ions are arranged with respect to one another. A crystalline material is one in which the 
atoms are situated in a repeating or periodic array over large atomic distances—that is, long-range order exists, such that upon solidification, the atoms will position themselves crystalline3.2 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTSCrystal StructuresThe properties of some materials are directly related 
to their crystal structures. For example, pure and undeformed magnesium and beryllium, having one crystal structure, are much more brittle (i.e., fracture at lower degrees of deformation) than are pure and undeformed metals such as gold and silver that have yet another crystal structure (see Section 7.4).Furthermore, significant property differences 
exist between crystalline and noncrystalline materials having the same composition. For example, noncrystalline  ceramics and polymers normally are optically transparent; the same materials in crystalline (or semicrystalline) form tend to be opaque or, at best, translucent.

in a repetitive three-dimensional pattern, in which each atom is bonded to its nearest-
neighbor atoms. All metals, many ceramic materials, and certain polymers form crystal-line structures under normal solidification conditions. For those that do not crystallize, this long-range atomic order is absent; these noncrystalline or amorphous materials are 
discussed briefly at the end of this chapter.
Some of the properties of crystalline solids depend on the crystal structure of the 
material, the manner in which atoms, ions, or molecules are spatially arranged. There is an extremely large number of different crystal structures all having long-range atomic order; these vary from relatively simple structures for metals to exceedingly complex ones, as displayed by some of the ceramic and polymeric materials. The present dis-cussion deals with several common metallic crystal structures. Chapters 12 and 14 are devoted to crystal structures for ceramics and polymers, respectively.
When crystalline structures are described, atoms (or ions) are thought of as being 
solid spheres having well-defined diameters. This is termed the atomic hard-sphere 
model in which spheres representing nearest-neighbor atoms touch one another. An example of the hard-sphere model for the atomic arrangement found in some of the common elemental metals is displayed in Figure 3.1 c. In this particular case all the atoms 
are identical. Sometimes the term lattice is used in the context of crystal structures; in 
this sense lattice means a three-dimensional array of points coinciding with atom posi-tions (or sphere centers).crystal structure

The atomic order in crystalline solids indicates that small groups of atoms form a repeti-
tive pattern. Thus, in describing crystal structures, it is often convenient to subdivide the structure into small repeat entities called unit cells.  Unit cells for most crystal structures 
are parallelepipeds or prisms having three sets of parallel faces; one is drawn within the aggregate of spheres (Figure 3.1c ), which in this case happens to be a cube. A unit cell is unit cell3.3 UNIT CELLS
3.4 Metallic Crystal Structures  •   51
chosen to represent the symmetry of the crystal structure, wherein all the atom positions 
in the crystal may be generated by translations of the unit cell integral distances along each of its edges. Thus, the unit cell is the basic structural unit or building block of the crystal structure and defines the crystal structure by virtue of its geometry and the atom positions within. Convenience usually dictates that parallelepiped corners coincide with centers of the hard-sphere atoms. Furthermore, more than a single unit cell may be chosen for a particular crystal structure; however, we generally use the unit cell having the high-est level of geometrical symmetry.
The atomic bonding in this group of materials is metallic and thus nondirectional in nature. Consequently, there are minimal restrictions as to the number and position of nearest-neighbor atoms; this leads to relatively large numbers of nearest neighbors and dense atomic packings for most metallic crystal structures. Also, for metals, when we use the hard-sphere model for the crystal structure, each sphere represents an ion core. Table 3.1 presents the atomic radii for a number of metals. Three relatively simple crystal structures are found for most of the common metals: face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed.
The Face-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure
The crystal structure found for many metals has a unit cell of cubic geometry, with atoms located at each of the corners and the centers of all the cube faces. It is aptly called the 
face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. Some of the familiar metals having this 
crystal structure are copper, aluminum, silver, and gold (see also Table 3.1). Figure 3.1 a 
shows a hard-sphere model for the FCC unit cell, whereas in Figure 3.1 b the atom 
centers are represented by small circles to provide a better perspective on atom positions. The aggregate of atoms in Figure 3.1 c represents a section of crystal consisting of many 
FCC unit cells. These spheres or ion cores touch one another across a face diagonal; the 
cube edge length a and the atomic radius R are related through
 
a=2R√2 (3.1)

52  •   Chapter 3  /  The Structure of Crystalline Solids
On occasion, we need to determine the number of atoms associated with each unit 
cell. Depending on an atom’s location, it may be considered to be shared with adja-
cent unit cells—that is, only some fraction of the atom is assigned to a specific cell. For example, for cubic unit cells, an atom completely within the interior “belongs” to that unit cell, one at a cell face is shared with one other cell, and an atom residing at a corner is shared among eight. The number of atoms per unit cell, N, can be computed using the 
following formula:
 N=N
i+Nf
2+Nc
8 (3.2)
where
 Ni = the number of interior atoms
 Nf = the number of face atoms
 Nc = the number of corner atoms
For the FCC crystal structure, there are eight corner atoms (Nc = 8), six face atoms 
(Nf = 6), and no interior atoms (Ni = 0). Thus, from Equation 3.2,
N=0+6
2+8
8=4
or a total of four whole atoms may be assigned to a given unit cell. This is depicted in 
Figure 3.1a, where only sphere portions are represented within the confines of the cube. The cell is composed of the volume of the cube that is generated from the centers of the corner atoms, as shown in the figure.
Corner and face positions are really equivalent—that is, translation of the cube 
corner from an original corner atom to the center of a face atom will not alter the cell structure.
Two other important characteristics of a crystal structure are the coordination 
number and the atomic packing factor (APF). For metals, each atom has the same num-
ber of nearest-neighbor or touching atoms, which is the coordination number. For face-
centered cubics, the coordination number is 12. This may be confirmed by examination of Figure 3.1a; the front face atom has four corner nearest-neighbor atoms surrounding it, four face atoms that are in contact from behind, and four other equivalent face atoms residing in the next unit cell to the front (not shown).
The APF is the sum of the sphere volumes of all atoms within a unit cell (assuming 
the atomic hard-sphere model) divided by the unit cell volume—that is,
 
APF =volume of atoms in a unit cell
total unit cell volume (3.3)
For the FCC structure, the atomic packing factor is 0.74, which is the maximum pack-
ing possible for spheres all having the same diameter. Computation of this APF is also included as an example problem. Metals typically have relatively large atomic packing factors to maximize the shielding provided by the free electron cloud.
The Body-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure
Another common metallic crystal structure also has a cubic unit cell with atoms located at all eight corners and a single atom at the cube center. This is called a body-centered 
cubic (BCC) crystal structure. A collection of spheres depicting this crystal structure is 
shown in Figure 3.2c, whereas Figures 3.2a and 3.2b are diagrams of BCC unit cells with 
the atoms represented by hard-sphere and reduced-sphere models, respectively. Center coordination number

and corner atoms touch one another along cube diagonals, and unit cell length a and 
atomic radius R are related through
 a=4R
√3 (3.4)
Chromium, iron, tungsten, and several other metals listed in Table 3.1 exhibit a BCC 
structure.
Each BCC unit cell has eight corner atoms and a single center atom, which is wholly con-
tained within its cell; therefore, from Equation 3.2, the number of atoms per BCC unit cell is
 N=Ni+Nf
2+Nc
8
 =1+0+8
8=2
The coordination number for the BCC crystal structure is 8; each center atom has as 
nearest neighbors its eight corner atoms. Because the coordination number is less for BCC than for FCC, the atomic packing factor is also lower for BCC—0.68 versus 0.74.
It is also possible to have a unit cell that consists of atoms situated only at the 
corners of a cube. This is called the simple cubic (SC) crystal structure; hard-sphere and 
reduced-sphere models are shown, respectively, in Figures 3.3 a and 3.3b. None of the 
metallic elements have this crystal structure because of its relatively low atomic packing factor (see Concept Check 3.1). The only simple-cubic element is polonium, which is considered to be a metalloid (or semi-metal).
The Hexagonal Close-Packed Crystal Structure
Not all metals have unit cells with cubic symmetry; the final common metallic crystal structure to be discussed has a unit cell that is hexagonal. Figure 3.4 a shows a reduced-
sphere unit cell for this structure, which is termed hexagonal close-packed (HCP); an 
assemblage of several HCP unit cells is presented in Figure 3.4 b.

through H in Figure 3.4a. Thus, the atom denoted J lies within the unit cell interior.Tutorial Video:

faces of the unit cell consist of six atoms that form regular hexagons and surround a 
single atom in the center. Another plane that provides three additional atoms to the unit cell is situated between the top and bottom planes. The atoms in this midplane have as nearest neighbors atoms in both of the adjacent two planes.
In order to compute the number of atoms per unit cell for the HCP crystal structure, 
Equation 3.2 is modified to read as follows:
N=N
i+Nf
2+Nc
6 (3.5)
That is, one-sixth of each corner atom is assigned to a unit cell (instead of 8 as with the cubic structure). Because for HCP there are 6 corner atoms in each of the top and bot-tom faces (for a total of 12 corner atoms), 2 face center atoms (one from each of the top and bottom faces), and 3 midplane interior atoms, the value of N for HCP is found, using Equation 3.5, to be
N=3+2
2+12
6=6
Thus, 6 atoms are assigned to each unit cell.   : VMSE

If a and c represent, respectively, the short and long unit cell dimensions of Figure 3.4a , 
the c/a ratio should be 1.633; however, for some HCP metals, this ratio deviates from the 
ideal value.
The coordination number and the atomic packing factor for the HCP crystal struc-
ture are the same as for FCC: 12 and 0.74, respectively. The HCP metals include 
cadmium, magnesium, titanium, and zinc; some of these are listed in Table 3.1.
EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.1
Determination of FCC Unit Cell Volume
Calculate the volume of an FCC unit cell in terms of the atomic radius R.
Solution
In the FCC unit cell illustrated, the atoms touch one another 
across a face-diagonal, the length of which is 4R . Because the 
unit cell is a cube, its volume is a3, where a is the cell edge 
length. From the right triangle on the face,

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.3
Determination of HCP Unit Cell Volume
(a)  Calculate the volume of an HCP unit cell in 
terms of its a and c lattice parameters.
(b)  Now provide an expression for this volume in terms of the atomic radius, R, and the c lattice 
parameter.
Solution
(a)  We use the adjacent reduced-sphere HCP unit cell to solve this problem.
Now, the unit cell volume is just the product 
of the base area times the cell height, c . This base 
area is just three times the area of the parallel-epiped ACDE shown below. (This ACDE paral-
lelepiped is also labeled in the above unit cell.)
The area of ACDE is just the length of CD
 
times the height BC. But CD is just a, and BC is equal to
BC=a cos(30 °)=a√3
2
Thus, the base area is just
AREA =(3)(CD )(BC )=(3)(a )(a√3
2)=3a2√3

Again, the unit cell volume VC is just the product of the 
AREA and c; thus,

Theoretical Density Computation for Copper
Copper has an atomic radius of 0.128 nm, an FCC crystal structure, and an atomic weight of 
63.5 g/mol. Compute its theoretical density, and compare the answer with its measured density.
Solution
Equation 3.8 is employed in the solution of this problem. Because the crystal structure is 
FCC, n, the number of atoms per unit cell, is 4. Furthermore, the atomic weight ACu is given 
as 63.5 g/mol. The unit cell volume VC for FCC was determined in Example Problem 3.1 as 
16R3√2, where R , the atomic radius, is 0.128 nm.

The literature value for the density of copper is 8.94 g/cm3, which is in very close agreement 
with the foregoing result.
Some metals, as well as nonmetals, may have more than one crystal structure, a phenomenon known as polymorphism.  When found in elemental solids, the condi-
tion is often termed allotropy.  The prevailing crystal structure depends on both the 
temperature and the external pressure. One familiar example is found in carbon: graphite is the stable polymorph at ambient conditions, whereas diamond is formed at extremely high pressures. Also, pure iron has a BCC crystal structure at room temperature, which changes to FCC iron at 912° C (1674° F). Most often a modifica-
tion of the density and other physical properties accompanies a polymorphic trans-formation.polymorphism

Tin (Its Allotropic Transformation)MATERIAL OF IMPORTANCE 3 . 1
Another common metal that experiences an al-
lotropic change is tin. White (or 𝛽) tin, having 
a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature, transforms, at 13.2°C (55.8°F), to gray 
White (𝛽) tinCooling13.2 °C
Gray (𝛼) tin
The rate at which this change takes place is extremely slow; however, the lower the temperature (below 13.2°C) the faster the rate. Accompanying this white-to-gray-tin transformation is an increase in volume (27%), and, accordingly, a decrease in density (from 7 .30 g/cm
3 to 5.77 g/cm3). Consequently, this volume 
expansion results in the disintegration of the white tin metal into a coarse powder of the gray allotrope. For normal subambient temperatures, there is no need to worry about this disintegration process for tin prod-ucts because of the very slow rate at which the trans-formation occurs.
This white-to-gray tin transition produced some 
rather dramatic results in 1850 in Russia. The winter that year was particularly cold, and record low tem-peratures persisted for extended periods of time. The uniforms of some Russian soldiers had tin buttons, many of which crumbled because of these extreme cold conditions, as did also many of the tin church organ pipes. This problem came to be known as the tin disease .

grated upon transforming to gray tin (right) after it was cooled to and held at a temperature below 13.2 °C for

3In simple terms, degree of crystal symmetry may be identified by the number of unique unit cell parameters—that is, 
higher symmetries are associated with fewer parameters.  For example, cubic structures have the highest symmetry inasmuch as there is only unique lattice parameter—i.e., the unit cell edge length, a. On the other hand, for triclinic, 
which has the lowest symmetry, there are six unique parameters—three unit cell edge lengths and three interaxial angles.Concept Check 3.2 What is the difference between crystal structure and crystal system?

It is important to note that many of the principles and concepts addressed in previ-
ous discussions in this chapter also apply to crystalline ceramic and polymeric systems 
(Chapters 12 and 14). For example, crystal structures are most often described in terms of unit cells, which are normally more complex than those for FCC, BCC, and HCP. In addition, for these other systems, we are often interested in determining atomic pack-ing factors and densities, using modified forms of Equations 3.3 and 3.8. Furthermore, according to unit cell geometry, crystal structures of these other material types are grouped within the seven crystal systems.Because there are many different possible crystal structures, it is sometimes con-venient to divide them into groups according to unit cell configurations and/or atomic arrangements. One such scheme is based on the unit cell geometry, that is, the shape of the appropriate unit cell parallelepiped without regard to the atomic positions in the cell. Within this framework, an x-y-z coordinate system is established with its ori-gin at one of the unit cell corners; each of the x, y, and z axes coincides with one of the 
three parallelepiped edges that extend from this corner, as illustrated in Figure 3.5. The unit cell geometry is completely defined in terms of six parameters: the three edge lengths a, b, and c , and the three interaxial angles 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝛾 . These are indicated in 
Figure 3.5, and are sometimes termed the lattice parameters of a crystal structure.
On this basis there are seven different possible combinations of a , b, and c  and 𝛼 , 𝛽, and 
𝛾, each of which represents a distinct crystal system. These seven crystal systems are cubic, 
tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral,
2 monoclinic, and triclinic. The lattice 
parameter relationships and unit cell sketches for each are represented in Table 3.2. The cubic system, for which a = b
 = c and 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°, has the greatest degree of symmetry. 
The least symmetry is displayed by the triclinic system, because a≠b≠c and 𝛼≠𝛽≠𝛾 .3
From the discussion of metallic crystal structures, it should be apparent that both 
FCC and BCC structures belong to the cubic crystal system, whereas HCP falls within the hexagonal system. The conventional hexagonal unit cell really consists of three  parallelepipeds situated as shown in Table 3.2.   : VMSE

3.8 Point Coordinates  •   61
Sometimes it is necessary to specify a lattice position within a unit cell. Lattice position 
is defined in terms of three lattice position coordinates, which are associated with the x, 
y, and z axes—we have chosen to label these coordinates as Px, Py, and Pz. Coordinate 
specifications are possible using three point indices: q, r, and s. These indices are frac-
tional multiples of a, b, and c unit cell lengths—that is, q is some fractional length of a 
along the x axis, r is some fractional length of b along the y axis, and similarly for s. In other words, lattice position coordinates (i.e., the Ps) are equal to the products of their 
respective point indices and the unit cell edge lengths—viz.
 P
x=qa (3.9a)
 Py=rb (3.9b)
 Pz=sc (3.9c)
To illustrate, consider the unit cell in Figure 3.6, the x-y-z coordinate system with its 
origin located at a unit cell corner, and the lattice site located at point P. Note how the 
location of P is related to the products of its q, r, and s point indices and the unit cell 
edge lengths.43.8 POINT COORDINATES

normal convention).Figure 3.6  The manner in which the 
q, r, and s coordinates at point P within 
the unit cell are determined. The q index (which is a fraction) corresponds to the distance qa along the x axis, where a is the unit cell edge length. The respective r and s indices for the y and z axes are determined similarly.z

Directions, and Planes
When dealing with crystalline materials, it often becomes necessary to specify a particu-
lar point within a unit cell, a crystallographic direction, or some crystallographic plane of atoms. Labeling conventions have been established in which three numbers or indices are used to designate point locations, directions, and planes. The basis for determining index values is the unit cell, with a right-handed coordinate system consisting of three (x, y, and z) axes situated at one of the corners and coinciding with the unit cell edges, 
as shown in Figure 3.5. For some crystal systems—namely, hexagonal, rhombohedral, monoclinic, and triclinic—the three axes are not mutually perpendicular, as in the familiar Cartesian coordinate scheme.

To locate the point having these coordinates within the unit cell, first use the x lattice position 
coordinate and move from the origin (point M) 0.12 nm units along the x axis (to point N), as 
shown in (b). Similarly, using the y lattice position coordinate, proceed 0.46 nm parallel to the 
y axis, from point N  to point O . Finally, move from this position 0.20 nm units parallel to the 
z axis to point P  (per the z  lattice position), as noted again in (b ). Thus, point P  corresponds to 
the 1

2 point indices.
Specification of Point Indices
Specify indices for all numbered points of the unit cell in the illustration on the next page.
Solution
For this unit cell, lattice points are located at all eight corners with a single point at the center 
position.
3.8 Point Coordinates  •   63
Point 1 is located at the origin of the coordinate system, and, 
therefore, its lattice position coordinates referenced to the x, y, 
and z  axes are 0a , 0b, and 0c , respectively. And from Equations 3.9a 
through 3.9c,
Px=qa=0a
Py=rb=0b
Pz=sc=0c
Solving the above three expressions for values of the q, r, and s 
indices leads to
 q=0a
a=0
 r=0b
b=0
 s=0c
c=0
Therefore this is the 0 0 0 point.
 Because point number 2 lies one unit cell edge length along the x axis, its lattice position coordinates referenced to the x, y, and z axes are a, 0b, and 0c, and
P
x=qa=a
Py=rb=0b
Pz=sc=0c
Thus we determine values for the q, r, and s indices as follows:
q=1   r=0   s=0
Hence, point 2 is 1 0 0. This same procedure is carried out for the remaining seven points in the unit cell. Point indices for all nine points are listed in the following table.xy

64  •   Chapter 3  /  The Structure of Crystalline Solids
A crystallographic direction is defined as a line directed between two points, or a vector. 
The following steps are used to determine the three directional indices:
 1. A right-handed x-y-z coordinate system is first constructed. As a matter of con-
venience, its origin may be located at a unit cell corner.
 2. The coordinates of two points that lie on the direction vector (referenced to 
the coordinate system) are determined—for example, for the vector tail, point 
1: x1, y1, and z1; whereas for the vector head, point 2: x2, y2, and z2.5
 3. Tail point coordinates are subtracted from head point components—that is, 
x2 − x1, y2 − y1, and z2 − z1.
 4. These coordinate differences are then normalized in terms of (i.e., divided by) their respective a, b, and c lattice parameters—that is,
x
2−x1
a y2−y1
b z2−z1
c
  which yields a set of three numbers.
 5. If necessary, these three numbers are multiplied or divided by a common factor 
to reduce them to the smallest integer values.
 6. The three resulting indices, not separated by commas, are enclosed in square 
brackets, thus: [uvw]. The u , v, and w integers correspond to the normalized 
coordinate differences referenced to the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
In summary, the u, v , and w indices may be determined using the following equations:
  u=n(x2−x1
a) (3.10a)
  v=n(y2−y1
b) (3.10b)
  w=n(z2−z1
c) (3.10c)
In these expressions, n  is the factor that may be required to reduce u , v, and w to integers.
For each of the three axes, there are both positive and negative coordinates. Thus, 
negative indices are also possible, which are represented by a bar over the appropri-
ate index. For example, the [11 1] direction has a component in the −y direction. Also, 
changing the signs of all indices produces an antiparallel direction; that is, [1 11] is 
directly opposite to [11 1]. If more than one direction (or plane) is to be specified for a 
particular crystal structure, it is imperative for maintaining consistency that a positive–negative convention, once established, not be changed.
The [100], [110], and [111] directions are common ones; they are drawn in the unit 
cell shown in Figure 3.7.   : VMSE

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.7
Determination of Directional Indices
Determine the indices for the direction shown in 
the accompanying figure.
Solution
It is first necessary to take note of the vector tail 
and head coordinates. From the illustration, tail coordinates are as follows:
x
1=a   y1=0b   z1=0c
For the head coordinates,
x2=0a   y2=b   z2=c/2
Now taking point coordinate differences,
 x2−x1=0a−a=−a
 y2−y1=b−0b=b
 z2−z1=c/2−0c=c/2
It is now possible to use Equations 3.10a through 3.10c to compute values of  u, v, and w. 
However, because the z2 − z1 difference is a fraction (i.e., c/2), we anticipate that in order to 
have integer values for the three indices, it is necessary to assign n a value of 2. Thus,
 u=n(x2−x1
a)=2(−a
a)=−2
 v=n(y2−y1
b)=2(b
b)=2
 w=n(z2−z1
c)=2(c∕2
c)=1
And, finally enclosure of the −2, 2, and 1 indices in brackets leads to [2 21] as the direction 
designation.6
 This procedure is summarized as follows:z

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.8
Construction of a Specified Crystallographic Direction
Within the following unit cell draw a [11 0] direction with its tail 
located at the origin of the coordinate system, point O.
Solution
This problem is solved by reversing the procedure of the preceding 
example. For this [11 0] direction,
 u=1
 v=−1
 w=0
Because the tail of the direction vector is positioned at the origin, its coordinates are as follows:
 
x1=0a
 y1=0b
 z1=0c
We now want to solve for the coordinates of the vector head—that is, x2, y2, and z2. This is 
possible using rearranged forms of Equations 3.10a through 3.10c and incorporating the above values for the three direction indices (u, v , and w) and vector tail coordinates. Taking the value 
of n to be 1 because the three direction indices are all integers leads to
 
x2=ua+x1=(1)(a )+0a=a
 y2=vb+y1=(−1)(b)+0b=−b
 z2=wc+z1=(0)(c )+0c=0c
The construction process for this direction vec-tor is shown in the following figure. Because the tail of the vector is positioned at the origin, we start at the point labeled O 
and then move in a stepwise manner to locate the vector head. Because the x head coordinate 
(x
2) is a, we proceed from point O, a units along 
the x axis to point Q. From point Q, we move b 
units parallel to the −y axis to point P, because 
the y head coordinate (y2) is −b. There is no z 
component to the vector inasmuch as the z head 
coordinate (z2) is 0c. Finally, the vector corre-
sponding to this [11 0] direction is constructed by 
drawing a line from point O to point P, as noted in the illustration.z

P[110] Direction
For some crystal structures, several nonparallel directions with different indices are 
crystallographically equivalent, meaning that the spacing of atoms along each direction is the same. For example, in cubic crystals, all the directions represented by the follow-ing indices are equivalent: [100], [1
00], [010], [01 0], [001], and [001 ]. As a convenience, 
equivalent directions are grouped together into a family, which is enclosed in angle Tutorial Video
3.9 Crystallographic Directions  •   67
brackets, thus: 〈 100〉 . Furthermore, directions in cubic crystals having the same indices 
without regard to order or sign—for example, [123] and [2 13]—are equivalent. This is, 
in general, not true for other crystal systems. For example, for crystals of tetragonal 
symmetry, the [100] and [010] directions are equivalent, whereas the [100] and [001] are not.
Directions in Hexagonal Crystals
A problem arises for crystals having hexagonal symmetry in that some equivalent crys-tallographic directions do not have the same set of indices. This situation is addressed using a four-axis, or Miller–Bravais, coordinate system, which is shown in Figure 3.8a. The three a
1, a2, and a3 axes are all contained within a single plane (called the basal 
plane) and are at 120° angles to one another. The z axis is perpendicular to this basal plane. Directional indices, which are obtained as described earlier, are denoted by four indices, as [uvtw]; by convention, the u, v, and t relate to vector coordinate differences 
referenced to the respective a
1, a2, and a3 axes in the basal plane; the fourth index pertains 
to the z axis.
Conversion from the three-index system (using the a1–a2–z coordinate axes of 
Figure 3.8b) to the four-index system as
[UVW ]→[uvtw ]
is accomplished using the following formulas7:
 u=1
3(2U−V) (3.11a)
 v=1
3(2V−U) (3.11b)
 t=−(u+v)  (3.11c)
 w=W  (3.11d)
Here, uppercase U, V , and W indices are associated with the three-index scheme 
(instead of u, v , and w as previously), whereas lowercase u, v , t, and w correlate with 
the Miller–Bravais four-index system. For example, using these equations, the [010] direction becomes [1
210]; furthermore, [1 210] is also equivalent to the following: [1210], 
[1210], [1210].

68  •   Chapter 3  /  The Structure of Crystalline Solids
Several directions have been drawn in the hexagonal unit cell of Figure 3.9.
Determination of directional indices is carried out using a procedure similar to the 
one used for other crystal systems—by the subtraction of vector tail point coordinates from head point coordinates. To simplify the demonstration of this procedure, we first determine the U, V, and W indices using the three-axis a
1–a2–z coordinate system of 
Figure 3.8b and then convert to the u, v, t, and w indices using Equations 3.11a–3.11d.
The designation scheme for the three sets of head and tail coordinates is as follows:
Using this scheme, the U, V, and W hexagonal index equivalents of Equations 3.10a 
through 3.10c are as follows:
  U=n (a″1−a′1
a) (3.12a)
  V=n (a″2−a′2
a) (3.12b)
  W=n (z″−z′

In these expressions, the parameter n is included to facilitate, if necessary, reduction of 
the U, V, and W to integer values.Figure 3.9  For the hexagonal crystal system, the

3.9 Crystallographic Directions  •   69
Solution
The first thing we need to do is determine U, V, and 
W indices for the vector referenced to the three-axis 
scheme represented in the sketch; this is possible us-ing Equations 3.12a through 3.12c. Because the vector passes through the origin, a′
1=a′2=0a and z′=0c. 
Furthermore, from the sketch, coordinates for the vector head are as follows:
 a″
1=0a
 a″2=−a
 z″=c
2
Because the denominator in z″ is 2, we assume that 
n = 2. Therefore,
 U=n(a″1−a1′
a)=2(0a−0a
a)=0
 V=n(a″2−a′2
a)=2(−a−0a
a)=−2
 W=n(z″−z′
c)=2(c/2−0c
c)=1
This direction is represented by enclosing the above indices in brackets—namely, [02 1].
 (b) To convert these indices into an index set referenced to the four-axis scheme 
requires the use of Equations 3.11a–3.11d. For this [02 1] direction
U=0   V=−2   W=1

Multiplication of the preceding indices by 3 reduces them to the lowest set, which yields values 
for u, v, t, and w of 2, −4, 2, and 3, respectively. Hence, the direction vector shown in the figure 
is [24 23].a1a2z

The procedure used to plot direction vectors in crystals having hexagonal symmetry

70  •   Chapter 3  /  The Structure of Crystalline Solids
The orientations of planes for a crystal structure are represented in a similar manner. Again, 
the unit cell is the basis, with the three-axis coordinate system as represented in Figure 3.5. In all but the hexagonal crystal system, crystallographic planes are specified by three Miller 
indices as (hkl). Any two planes parallel to each other are equivalent and have identical 
indices. The procedure used to determine the h , k, and l  index numbers is as follows:
 1. If the plane passes through the selected origin, either another parallel plane must 
be constructed within the unit cell by an appropriate translation, or a new origin 
must be established at the corner of another unit cell.
8
 2. At this point, the crystallographic plane either intersects or parallels each of the three 
axes. The coordinate for the intersection of the crystallographic plane with each of the axes is determined (referenced to the origin of the coordinate system). These intercepts for the x , y, and z  axes will be designed by A , B, and C , respectively.
9
 3. The reciprocals of these numbers are taken. A plane that parallels an axis is con-
sidered to have an infinite intercept and therefore a zero index.
 4. The reciprocals of the intercepts are then normalized in terms of (i.e., multiplied 
by) their respective a, b, and c lattice parameters. That is,
a
A  b
B     c
C
 5. If necessary, these three numbers are changed to the set of smallest integers by 
multiplication or by division by a common factor.10
 6. Finally, the integer indices, not separated by commas, are enclosed within paren-
theses, thus: (hkl). The h , k, and l integers correspond to the normalized intercept 
reciprocals referenced to the x, y, and z axes, respectively.
In summary, the h , k, and l indices may be determined using the following equations:
 h=na
A (3.13a)
 k=nb
B (3.13b)
 l=nc
C (3.13c)
In these expressions, n is the factor that may be required to reduce h, k, and l to integers.
An intercept on the negative side of the origin is indicated by a bar or minus sign 
positioned over the appropriate index. Furthermore, reversing the directions of all indi-ces specifies another plane parallel to, on the opposite side of, and equidistant from the origin. Several low-index planes are represented in Figure 3.10.Miller indices   : VMSE
Crystallographic 
Planes3.10 CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PLANES
8When selecting a new origin, the following procedure is suggested:
If the crystallographic plane that intersects the origin lies in one of the unit cell faces, move the origin one unit 
cell distance parallel to the axis that intersects this plane.
If the crystallographic plane that intersects the origin passes through one of the unit cell axes, move the origin 
one unit cell distance parallel to either of the two other axes.
For all other cases, move the origin one unit cell distance parallel to any of the three unit cell axes.
9These intercept points are lattice position coordinates, and their values are determined using the procedure outlined 
in Section 3.8.
10On occasion, index reduction is not carried out (e.g., for x-ray diffraction studies described in Section 3.16); for 
example, (002) is not reduced to (001). In addition, for ceramic materials, the ionic arrangement for a reduced-index 
plane may be different from that for a nonreduced one.
3.10 Crystallographic Planes  •   71
One interesting and unique characteristic of cubic crystals is that planes and direc-
tions having the same indices are perpendicular to one another; however, for other crys-
tal systems there are no simple geometrical relationships between planes and directions having the same indices.Figure 3.10

Solution
Because the plane passes through the selected origin O , a new origin must be chosen at the 
corner of an adjacent unit cell. In choosing this new unit cell, we move one unit-cell distance 
parallel to the y -axis, as shown in sketch (b ). Thus x ʹ-y-z ʹ is the new coordinate axis system 
having its origin located at O ʹ. Because this plane is parallel to the x ʹ axis its intercept is 
∞a—that is, A  = ∞a. Furthermore, from illustration (b ), intersections with the y  and z ʹ axes 
are as follows:
B=−b   C=c∕2
It is now possible to use Equations 3.13a–3.13c to determine values of  h, k, and l. At this point, 
let us choose a value of 1 for n. Thus,

Atomic Arrangements
The atomic arrangement for a crystallographic plane, which is often of interest, depends 
on the crystal structure. The (110) atomic planes for FCC and BCC crystal structures are represented in Figures 3.11 and 3.12, respectively. Reduced-sphere unit cells are also included. Note that the atomic packing is different for each case. The circles repre-sent atoms lying in the crystallographic planes as would be obtained from a slice taken through the centers of the full-size hard spheres.
A “family” of planes contains all planes that are crystallographically equivalent —
that is, having the same atomic packing; a family is designated by indices enclosed in 
braces—such as {100}. For example, in cubic crystals, the (111), (1
  1  1), (111), (1  1 1), (111 ), 
(1  11), (1 11), and (11 1) planes all belong to the {111} family. However, for tetragonal    : VMSE
Planar Atomic 
ArrangementsUsing these h, k, and l indices, we want to solve for the values of A, B, and C using rearranged 
forms of Equations 3.13a–3.13c. Taking the value of n  to be 1 —because these three Miller indices 
are all integers—leads to the following:
 A=na
h=(1)(a )
1=a
 B=nb
k=(1)( b)
0=∞b
 C=nc
l=(1)(c )
1=c
Thus, this (101) plane intersects the x axis at a 
(because A = a), it parallels the y  axis (because 
B = ∞b), and intersects the z  axis at c. On the unit 
cell shown in the ( b) sketch are noted the loca-
tions of the intersections for this plane.
The only plane that parallels the y axis and intersects the x 
and z axes at axial a  and c  coordinates, respectively, is shown in 
the (c ) sketch.
Note that the representation of a crystallographic plane ref-
erenced to a unit cell is by lines drawn to indicate intersections of 
this plane with unit cell faces (or extensions of these faces). The following guides are helpful with representing crystallographic planes:
 • If two of the h, k, and l indices are zeros [as with (100)], the 
plane will parallel one of the unit cell faces (per Figure 3.10 a).
 • If one of the indices is a zero [as with (110)], the plane will 
be a parallelogram, having two sides that coincide with opposing unit cell edges (or edges of adjacent unit cells) (per Figure 3.10b ).
 • If none of the indices is zero [as with (111)], all intersections will pass through unit cell faces 
(per Figure 3.10c).z

crystal structures, the {100} family contains only the (100), (1 00), (010), and (01 0) 
planes because the (001) and (001 ) planes are not crystallographically equivalent. Also, 
in the cubic system only, planes having the same indices, irrespective of order and sign, 
are equivalent. For example, both (12 3) and (31 2) belong to the {123} family.
Hexagonal Crystals
For crystals having hexagonal symmetry, it is desirable that equivalent planes have the same indices; as with directions, this is accomplished by the Miller–Bravais system shown in Figure 3.8a. This convention leads to the four-index (hkil) scheme, which is favored in most instances because it more clearly identifies the orientation of a plane in a hexagonal crystal. There is some redundancy in that i is determined by the sum of h and k through
 i=−(h+k) (3.14)
Otherwise, the three h, k, and l indices are identical for both indexing systems.
We determine these indices in a manner analogous to that used for other crystal sys-
tems as described previously—that is, taking normalized reciprocals of axial intercepts, 
as described in the following example problem.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.12
Determination of the Miller–Bravais Indices for a Plane within a 
Hexagonal Unit Cell
Determine the Miller–Bravais indices for the plane shown in the 
hexagonal unit cell.
Solution
These indices may be determined in the same manner that was used 
for the x-y-z coordinate situation and described in Example Problem 3.10. However, in this case the a
1, a2, and z  axes are used and corre-
late, respectively, with the x , y, and z  axes of the previous discussion. 
If we again take A , B, and C  to represent intercepts on the respective 
a1, a2, and z  axes, normalized intercept reciprocals may be written as
a
A  a
B     c
C
Now, because the three intercepts noted on the above unit cell are
A=a   B=−a   C=c
values of h , k, and l , may be determined using Equations 3.13a–3.13c, as follows (assuming n = 1):
 h=na
A=(1)(a )
a=1
 k=na
B=(1)(a )
−a=−1
 l=nc
C=(1)(c )
c=1
And, finally, the value of i is found using Equation 3.14, as follows:
i=−(h+k)=−[1+(−1)]=0
Therefore, the (hkil) indices are (11 01).
Notice that the third index is zero (i.e., its reciprocal = ∞), which means this plane parallels 
the a3 axis. Inspection of the preceding figure shows that this is indeed the case.a1a

The two previous sections discussed the equivalency of nonparallel crystallographic 
directions and planes. Directional equivalency is related to linear density in the sense 
that, for a particular material, equivalent directions have identical linear densities. The corresponding parameter for crystallographic planes is planar density, and planes having 
the same planar density values are also equivalent.
Linear density ( LD) is defined as the number of atoms per unit length whose cen-
ters lie on the direction vector for a specific crystallographic direction; that is,
 
LD =number  of atoms  centered  on direction  vector
length  of direction  vector (3.15)
The units of linear density are reciprocal length (e.g., nm−1, m−1).
For example, let us determine the linear density of the [110] direction for the FCC 
crystal structure. An FCC unit cell (reduced sphere) and the [110] direction therein are 
shown in Figure 3.14 a. Represented in Figure 3.14b  are the five atoms that lie on the bot-
tom face of this unit cell; here, the [110] direction vector passes from the center of atom X, through atom Y , and finally to the center of atom Z . With regard to the numbers of 
atoms, it is necessary to take into account the sharing of atoms with adjacent unit cells (as discussed in Section 3.4 relative to atomic packing factor computations). Each of the X and Z  corner atoms is also shared with one other adjacent unit cell along this [110] 
direction (i.e., one-half of each of these atoms belongs to the unit cell being considered), whereas atom Y lies entirely within the unit cell. Thus, there is an equivalence of two 
atoms along the [110] direction vector in the unit cell. Now, the direction vector length is equal to 4 R (Figure 3.14b ); thus, from Equation 3.15, the [110] linear density for FCC is

In an analogous manner, planar density ( PD) is taken as the number of atoms per 
unit area that are centered on a particular crystallographic plane, or
 PD=number of atoms centered on a plane
area of plane (3.17)
The units for planar density are reciprocal area (e.g., nm−2, m−2).
For example, consider the section of a (110) plane within an FCC unit cell as rep-
resented in Figures 3.11a and 3.11b. Although six atoms have centers that lie on this 
plane (Figure 3.11b), only one-quarter of each of atoms A, C, D, and F and one-half of 
atoms B and E, for a total equivalence of just 2 atoms, are on that plane. Furthermore, 
the area of this rectangular section is equal to the product of its length and width. From Figure 3.11b, the length (horizontal dimension) is equal to 4R, whereas the width (verti-cal dimension) is equal to 2 R
√2 because it corresponds to the FCC unit cell edge length 
(Equation 3.1). Thus, the area of this planar region is (4 R)(2R√2)=8R2√2, and the 
planar density is determined as follows:
 PD110=2 atoms
8R2√2=1
4R2√2 (3.18)
Linear and planar densities are important considerations relative to the process of slip—
that is, the mechanism by which metals plastically deform (Section 7.4). Slip occurs on 
the most densely packed crystallographic planes and, in those planes, along directions having the greatest atomic packing.Figure 3.14  (a) Reduced-sphere FCC unit cell

You may remember from the discussion on metallic crystal structures (Section 3.4) that 
both face-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed crystal structures have atomic packing factors of 0.74, which is the most efficient packing of equal-size spheres or atoms. In addition to unit cell representations, these two crystal structures may be described in terms of close-packed planes of atoms (i.e., planes having a maximum atom or sphere-packing density); a portion of one such plane is illustrated in Figure 3.15 a. Both 
crystal structures may be generated by the stacking of these close-packed planes on top of one another; the difference between the two structures lies in the stacking sequence.
Let the centers of all the atoms in one close-packed plane be labeled A. Associated 
with this plane are two sets of equivalent triangular depressions formed by three adja-cent atoms, into which the next close-packed plane of atoms may rest. Those having the triangle vertex pointing up are arbitrarily designated as B positions, whereas the remain-ing depressions are those with the down vertices, which are marked C in Figure 3.15a.   : VMSE

A second close-packed plane may be positioned with the centers of its atoms over 
either B or C  sites; at this point, both are equivalent. Suppose that the B positions are 
arbitrarily chosen; the stacking sequence is termed AB, which is illustrated in Figure 3.15b . 
The real distinction between FCC and HCP lies in where the third close-packed layer is 
positioned. For HCP, the centers of this layer are aligned directly above the original A
positions. This stacking sequence, ABABAB . . . , is repeated over and over. Of course, the ACACAC . . . arrangement would be equivalent. These close-packed planes for HCP 
are (0001)-type planes, and the correspondence between this and the unit cell representa-tion is shown in Figure 3.16.
For the face-centered crystal structure, the centers of the third plane are situated 
over the C sites of the first plane (Figure 3.17 a). This yields an ABCABCABC . . . 
stacking sequence; that is, the atomic alignment repeats every third plane. It is more difficult to correlate the stacking of close-packed planes to the FCC unit cell. However, this relationship is demonstrated in Figure 3.17 b. These planes are of the (111) type; an 
FCC unit cell is outlined on the upper left-hand front face of Figure 3.17 b to provide 
perspective. The significance of these FCC and HCP close-packed planes will become apparent in Chapter 7.
The concepts detailed in the previous four sections also relate to crystalline ceramic 
and polymeric materials, which are discussed in Chapters 12 and 14. We may specify Figure 3.15  (a) A portion of a close-packed plane of atoms; A, B, and C positions are indicated. (b) The AB

For a crystalline solid, when the periodic and repeated arrangement of atoms is perfect 
or extends throughout the entirety of the specimen without interruption, the result is a single crystal. All unit cells interlock in the same way and have the same orientation. 
Single crystals exist in nature, but they can also be produced artificially. They are ordi-narily difficult to grow because the environment must be carefully controlled.
If the extremities of a single crystal are permitted to grow without any external 
constraint, the crystal assumes a regular geometric shape having flat faces, as with some of the gemstones; the shape is indicative of the crystal structure. An iron pyrite single crystal is shown in Figure 3.18. Within the past few years, single crystals have become extremely important in many modern technologies, in particular electronic microcir-cuits, which employ single crystals of silicon and other semiconductors.single crystal3.13 SINGLE CRYSTALS
Most crystalline solids are composed of a collection of many small crystals or grains;  
such materials are termed polycrystalline.  Various stages in the solidification of a 
polycrystalline specimen are represented schematically in Figure 3.19. Initially, small grain

crystals or nuclei form at various positions. These have random crystallographic 
orientations, as indicated by the square grids. The small grains grow by the succes-sive addition from the surrounding liquid of atoms to the structure of each. The extremities of adjacent grains impinge on one another as the solidification process approaches completion. As indicated in Figure 3.19, the crystallographic orientation varies from grain to grain. Also, there exists some atomic mismatch within the region where two grains meet; this area, called a grain boundary,  is discussed in more detail 
in Section 4.6.
grain boundary
The physical properties of single crystals of some substances depend on the crystallo-graphic direction in which measurements are taken. For example, the elastic modulus, the electrical conductivity, and the index of refraction may have different values in the [100] and [111] directions. This directionality of properties is termed anisotropy, and it 
is associated with the variance of atomic or ionic spacing with crystallographic direction. Substances in which measured properties are independent of the direction of measure-ment are isotropic. The extent and magnitude of anisotropic effects in crystalline ma-
terials are functions of the symmetry of the crystal structure; the degree of anisotropy increases with decreasing structural symmetry—triclinic structures normally are highly anisotropic. The modulus of elasticity values at [100], [110], and [111] orientations for several metals are presented in Table 3.4.
For many polycrystalline materials, the crystallographic orientations of the indi-
vidual grains are totally random. Under these circumstances, even though each grain may be anisotropic, a specimen composed of the grain aggregate behaves isotropically. Also, the magnitude of a measured property represents some average of the directional values. Sometimes the grains in polycrystalline materials have a preferential crystallo-graphic orientation, in which case the material is said to have a “texture.”
The magnetic properties of some iron alloys used in transformer cores are 
anisotropic—that is, grains (or single crystals) magnetize in a 〈 100〉 -type direction 
easier than any other crystallographic direction. Energy losses in transformer cores are minimized by utilizing polycrystalline sheets of these alloys into which have been introduced a magnetic texture: most of the grains in each sheet have a 〈 100〉 -type 
crystallographic direction that is aligned (or almost aligned) in the same direction, which is oriented parallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field. Magnetic textures for iron alloys are discussed in detail in the Material of Importance box in Chapter 20 following Section 20.9.anisotropy

82  •   Chapter 3  /  The Structure of Crystalline Solids
Historically, much of our understanding regarding the atomic and molecular arrange-
ments in solids has resulted from x-ray diffraction investigations; furthermore, x-rays are still very important in developing new materials. We now give a brief overview of the diffraction phenomenon and how, using x-rays, atomic interplanar distances and crystal structures are deduced.
The Diffraction Phenomenon
Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters a series of regularly spaced obstacles that (1) are capable of scattering the wave, and (2) have spacings that are comparable in magnitude to the wavelength. Furthermore, diffraction is a consequence of specific phase relationships established between two or more waves that have been scattered by the obstacles.
Consider waves 1 and 2 in Figure 3.20a , which have the same wavelength (𝜆 ) 
and are in phase at point O–Oʹ . Now let us suppose that both waves are scattered 3.16  X-RAY DIFFRACTION: DETERMINATION

the same wavelength and become out of phase after a scattering event (waves 3 ′ and 4 ′) destructively interfere with 
one another. The amplitudes of the two scattered waves cancel one another.

in such a way that they traverse different paths. The phase relationship between the 
scattered waves, which depends upon the difference in path length, is important. One possibility results when this path length difference is an integral number of wavelengths. As noted in Figure 3.20a , these scattered waves (now labeled 1 ′ and 2′) 
are still in phase. They are said to mutually reinforce (or constructively interfere with) one another; when amplitudes are added, the wave shown on the right side of the figure results. This is a manifestation of diffraction,  and we refer to a diffracted 
beam as one composed of a large number of scattered waves that mutually reinforce one another.
Other phase relationships are possible between scattered waves that will not 
lead to this mutual reinforcement. The other extreme is that demonstrated in Figure 3.20b , in which the path length difference after scattering is some integral 
number of half-wavelengths. The scattered waves are out of phase — that is, corre-sponding amplitudes cancel or annul one another, or destructively interfere (i.e., the resultant wave has zero amplitude), as indicated on the right side of the figure. Of course, phase relationships intermediate between these two extremes exist, resulting in only partial reinforcement.
X-Ray Diffraction and Bragg’s Law
X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that have high energies and short wavelengths—wavelengths on the order of the atomic spacings for solids. When a beam of x-rays impinges on a solid material, a portion of this beam is scattered in all direc-tions by the electrons associated with each atom or ion that lies within the beam’s path. Let us now examine the necessary conditions for diffraction of x-rays by a periodic arrangement of atoms.
Consider the two parallel planes of atoms A–A ʹ and B–B ʹ in Figure 3.21, which have 
the same h, k, and l Miller indices and are separated by the interplanar spacing d
hkl. Now 
assume that a parallel, monochromatic, and coherent (in-phase) beam of x-rays of wave-length 𝜆 is incident on these two planes at an angle 𝜃. Two rays in this beam, labeled 
1 and 2, are scattered by atoms P and Q. Constructive interference of the scattered rays 1ʹ and 2 ʹ occurs also at an angle 𝜃 to the planes if the path length difference between 
1–P–1 ʹ and 2–Q–2 ʹ (i.e., SQ
+QT) is equal to a whole number, n, of wavelengths—that 
is, the condition for diffraction is

or
 n𝜆=dhkl sin  𝜃+dhkl sin  𝜃
  =2dhkl sin  𝜃 (3.20)
Equation 3.20 is known as Bragg’s law; n is the order of reflection, which may be 
any integer (1, 2, 3, . . .) consistent with sin 𝜃 not exceeding unity. Thus, we have a simple 
expression relating the x-ray wavelength and interatomic spacing to the angle of the 
diffracted beam. If Bragg’s law is not satisfied, then the interference will be noncon-structive so as to yield a very low-intensity diffracted beam.
The magnitude of the distance between two adjacent and parallel planes of atoms 
(i.e., the interplanar spacing d
hkl) is a function of the Miller indices (h, k, and l) as well 
as the lattice parameter(s). For example, for crystal structures that have cubic symmetry,
 dhkl=a
√h2+k2+l2 (3.21)
in which a  is the lattice parameter (unit cell edge length). Relationships similar to 
Equation 3.21, but more complex, exist for the other six crystal systems noted in Table 3.2.
Bragg’s law, Equation 3.20, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for diffrac-
tion by real crystals. It specifies when diffraction will occur for unit cells having atoms 
positioned only at cell corners. However, atoms situated at other sites (e.g., face and in-terior unit cell positions as with FCC and BCC) act as extra scattering centers, which can produce out-of-phase scattering at certain Bragg angles. The net result is the absence of some diffracted beams that, according to Equation 3.20, should be present. Specific sets of crystallographic planes that do not give rise to diffracted beams depend on crystal structure. For the BCC crystal structure, h + k + l must be even if diffraction is to occur, 
whereas for FCC, h, k , and l must all be either odd or even; diffracted beams for all sets 
of crystallographic planes are present for the simple cubic crystal structure (Figure 3.3). These restrictions, called reflection rules, are summarized in Table 3.5.

3.16 X-Ray Diffraction: Determination of Crystal Structures   •  85
Diffraction Techniques
One common diffraction technique employs a powdered or polycrystalline specimen 
consisting of many fine and randomly oriented particles that are exposed to monochro-matic x-radiation. Each powder particle (or grain) is a crystal, and having a large number of them with random orientations ensures that some particles are properly oriented such that every possible set of crystallographic planes will be available for diffraction.
The diffractometer is an apparatus used to determine the angles at which diffraction 
occurs for powdered specimens; its features are represented schematically in Figure 3.22. A specimen S  in the form of a flat plate is supported so that rotations about the axis 
labeled O are possible; this axis is perpendicular to the plane of the page. The mono-
chromatic x-ray beam is generated at point T , and the intensities of diffracted beams are 
detected with a counter labeled C in the figure. The specimen, x-ray source, and counter 
are coplanar.
The counter is mounted on a movable carriage that may also be rotated about the 
O axis; its angular position in terms of 2𝜃 is marked on a graduated scale.
13 Carriage and 
specimen are mechanically coupled such that a rotation of the specimen through 𝜃 is ac-
companied by a 2𝜃 rotation of the counter; this ensures that the incident and reflection angles are maintained equal to one another (Figure 3.22). Collimators are incorporated within the beam path to produce a well-defined and focused beam. Utilization of a filter provides a near-monochromatic beam.
As the counter moves at constant angular velocity, a recorder automatically plots 
the diffracted beam intensity (monitored by the counter) as a function of 2𝜃 ; 2𝜃 is 
termed the diffraction angle, which is measured experimentally. Figure 3.23 shows a dif-fraction pattern for a powdered specimen of lead. The high-intensity peaks result when the Bragg diffraction condition is satisfied by some set of crystallographic planes. These peaks are plane-indexed in the figure.
Other powder techniques have been devised in which diffracted beam intensity and 
position are recorded on a photographic film instead of being measured by a counter.Figure 3.22  Schematic diagram

13Note that the symbol 𝜃 has been used in two different contexts for this discussion. Here, 𝜃 represents the angular 
locations of both x-ray source and counter relative to the specimen surface. Previously (e.g., Equation 3.20), it 
denoted the angle at which the Bragg criterion for diffraction is satisfied.
86  •   Chapter 3  /  The Structure of Crystalline Solids
One of the primary uses of x-ray diffractometry is for the determination of crystal 
structure. The unit cell size and geometry may be resolved from the angular positions 
of the diffraction peaks, whereas the arrangement of atoms within the unit cell is associ-ated with the relative intensities of these peaks.
X-rays, as well as electron and neutron beams, are also used in other types of ma-
terial investigations. For example, crystallographic orientations of single crystals are possible using x-ray diffraction (or Laue) photographs. The chapter-opening photo-graph (a) was generated using an incident x-ray beam that was directed on a magnesium crystal; each spot (with the exception of the darkest one near the center) resulted from an x-ray beam that was diffracted by a specific set of crystallographic planes. Other uses of x-rays include qualitative and quantitative chemical identifications and the determi-nation of residual stresses and crystal size.Figure 3.23

Interplanar Spacing and Diffraction Angle Computations
For BCC iron, compute (a) the interplanar spacing and (b) the diffraction angle for the (220) 
set of planes. The lattice parameter for Fe is 0.2866 nm. Assume that monochromatic radiation 
having a wavelength of 0.1790 nm is used, and the order of reflection is 1.
Solution
(a)  The value of the interplanar spacing dhkl is determined using Equation 3.21, with a  = 0.2866 nm, 
and h = 2, k = 2, and l  = 0 because we are considering the (220) planes. Therefore,
 dhkl=a

(b)  The value of 𝜃  may now be computed using Equation 3.20, with n  = 1 because this is a first-
order reflection:

Interplanar Spacing and Lattice Parameter Computations for Lead
Figure 3.23 shows an x-ray diffraction pattern for lead taken using a diffractometer and mono-
chromatic x-radiation having a wavelength of 0.1542 nm; each diffraction peak on the pattern has been indexed. Compute the interplanar spacing for each set of planes indexed; also, de-termine the lattice parameter of Pb for each of the peaks. For all peaks, assume the order of diffraction is 1.
Solution
For each peak, in order to compute the interplanar spacing and the lattice parameter we must 
employ Equations 3.20 and 3.21, respectively. The first peak of Figure 3.23, which results from diffraction by the (111) set of planes, occurs at 2𝜃  = 31.3° ; the corresponding interplanar spacing 
for this set of planes, using Equation 3.20, is equal to

It has been mentioned that noncrystalline solids lack a systematic and regular arrange-
ment of atoms over relatively large atomic distances. Sometimes such materials are also called amorphous (meaning literally “without form”), or supercooled liquids, inasmuch 
as their atomic structure resembles that of a liquid.
An amorphous condition may be illustrated by comparison of the crystalline and 
noncrystalline structures of the ceramic compound silicon dioxide (SiO
2), which may 
exist in both states. Figures 3.24 a and 3.24b present two-dimensional schematic dia-
grams for both structures of SiO2. Even though each silicon ion bonds to three oxygen 
ions (and a fourth oxygen ion above the plane) for both states, beyond this, the structure is much more disordered and irregular for the noncrystalline structure.
Whether a crystalline or an amorphous solid forms depends on the ease with 
which a random atomic structure in the liquid can transform to an ordered state during solidification. Amorphous materials, therefore, are characterized by atomic or molecular structures that are relatively complex and become ordered only with some noncrystalline

mation of a noncrystalline solid, because little time is allowed for the ordering process.
Metals normally form crystalline solids, but some ceramic materials are crystalline, 
whereas others—the inorganic glasses—are amorphous. Polymers may be completely noncrystalline or semicrystalline consisting of varying degrees of crystallinity. More about the structure and properties of amorphous ceramics and polymers is contained in Chapters 12 and 14.
SUMMARY
• Atoms in crystalline solids are positioned in orderly and repeated patterns that are in 
contrast to the random and disordered atomic distribution found in noncrystalline or amorphous materials.
• Crystal structures are specified in terms of parallelepiped unit cells, which are charac-
terized by geometry and atom positions within.
• Most common metals exist in at least one of three relatively simple crystal structures:
Face-centered cubic (FCC), which has a cubic unit cell (Figure 3.1).Body-centered cubic (BCC), which also has a cubic unit cell (Figure 3.2).Hexagonal close-packed, which has a unit cell of hexagonal symmetry, 
[Figure 3.4(a )].
• Two features of a crystal structure are
Coordination number—the number of nearest-neighbor atoms, andAtomic packing factor—the fraction of solid sphere volume in the unit cell.Fundamental

Summary  •   89
• The theoretical density of a metal (𝜌 ) is a function of the number of equivalent atoms per 
unit cell, the atomic weight, unit cell volume, and Avogadro’s number (Equation 3.8).
• Polymorphism is when a specific material can have more than one crystal structure. 
Allotropy is polymorphism for elemental solids.
• The concept of a crystal system is used to classify crystal structures on the basis of unit 
cell geometry—that is, unit cell edge lengths and interaxial angles. There are seven crystal systems: cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral (trigonal), monoclinic, and triclinic.
• Crystallographic points, directions, and planes are specified in terms of indexing 
schemes. The basis for the determination of each index is a coordinate axis system defined by the unit cell for the particular crystal structure.
The location of a point within a unit cell is specified using coordinates that are 
fractional multiples of the cell edge lengths (Equations 3.9a–3.9c).
Directional indices are computed in terms of differences between vector head 
and tail coordinates (Equations 3.10a–3.10c).
Planar (or Miller) indices are determined from the reciprocals of axial intercepts 
(Equations 3.13a–3.13c).
• For hexagonal unit cells, a four-index scheme for both directions and planes is found 
to be more convenient. Directions may be determined using Equations 3.11a–3.11d and 3.12a–3.12c.
• Crystallographic directional and planar equivalencies are related to atomic linear and 
planar densities, respectively.
• For a given crystal structure, planes having identical atomic packing yet different 
Miller indices belong to the same family.
• Both FCC and HCP crystal structures may be generated by the stacking of close-
packed planes of atoms on top of one another. With this scheme A, B, and C denote 
possible atom positions on a close-packed plane.
The stacking sequence for HCP is ABABAB. . . .The stacking sequence for FCC is ABCABCABC. . . .
• Single crystals are materials in which the atomic order extends uninterrupted over the entirety of the specimen; under some circumstances, single crystals may have flat faces and regular geometric shapes.
• The vast majority of crystalline solids, however, are polycrystalline, being composed 
of many small crystals or grains having different crystallographic orientations.
• A grain boundary is the boundary region separating two grains where there is some 
atomic mismatch.
• Anisotropy is the directionality dependence of properties. For isotropic materials, properties are independent of the direction of measurement.
• X-ray diffractometry is used for crystal structure and interplanar spacing determinations. A beam of x-rays directed on a crystalline material may experience diffraction (con-structive interference) as a result of its interaction with a series of parallel atomic planes.
• Bragg’s law specifies the condition for diffraction of x-rays—Equation 3.20.
• Noncrystalline solid materials lack a systematic and regular arrangement of atoms or 
ions over relatively large distances (on an atomic scale). Sometimes the term amor-
phous is also used to describe these materials.Density

A tomic defects are 
responsible for reductions of gas 
pollutant emissions from today’s automobile engines. A catalytic converter is the pollutant-reducing device that is located in the automobile’s exhaust system. Molecules of pollutant gases become attached to surface defects of crystalline metallic materials found in the catalytic converter. While attached to these sites, the molecules experience chemical reactions that convert them into other, non-polluting or less-polluting substances. The Materials of Importance box in Section 4.6 contains a detailed description of this process.

Thus far it has been tacitly assumed that perfect order exists throughout crystalline ma-
terials on an atomic scale. However, such an idealized solid does not exist; all contain large numbers of various defects or imperfections. As a matter of fact, many of the prop-
erties of materials are profoundly sensitive to deviations from crystalline perfection; the influence is not always adverse, and often specific characteristics are deliberately fashioned by the introduction of controlled amounts or numbers of particular defects, as detailed in succeeding chapters.
A crystalline defect refers to a lattice irregularity having one or more of its dimen-
sions on the order of an atomic diameter. Classification of crystalline imperfections is frequently made according to the geometry or dimensionality of the defect. Several different imperfections are discussed in this chapter, including point defects (those as-
sociated with one or two atomic positions); linear (or one-dimensional) defects; and in-terfacial defects, or boundaries, which are two-dimensional. Impurities in solids are also discussed, because impurity atoms may exist as point defects. Finally, techniques for the microscopic examination of defects and the structure of materials are briefly described.imperfection
point defect4.1 INTRODUCTION
The simplest of the point defects is a vacancy, or vacant lattice site, one normally oc-
cupied but from which an atom is missing (Figure 4.1). All crystalline solids contain 
vacancies, and, in fact, it is not possible to create such a material that is free of these vacancy4.2 VACANCIES AND SELF-INTERSTITIALSPoint DefectsWHY STUDY Imperfections in Solids?
The properties of some materials are profoundly 
influenced by the presence of imperfections. Consequently, it is important to have a knowledge about the types of imperfections that exist and the roles they play in affecting the behavior of materials. For example, the mechanical properties of pure  metals experience significant alterations when the metals are alloyed (i.e., when impurity atoms are added)—for example, brass (70% copper–30% zinc) is much harder and stronger than pure copper (Section 7.9).
Also, integrated-circuit microelectronic 
 devices found in our computers, calculators, and home  appliances function because of highly controlled  concentrations of specific impurities that are  incorporated into small, localized regions of  semiconducting materials (Sections 18.11 and 18.15).

defects. The necessity of the existence of vacancies is explained using principles of 
thermodynamics; in essence, the presence of vacancies increases the entropy (i.e., the randomness) of the crystal.
The equilibrium number of vacancies N
𝜐 for a given quantity of material (usually 
per meter cubed) depends on and increases with temperature according to
 N𝜐=N exp(−Q𝜐
kT) (4.1)
In this expression, N is the total number of atomic sites (most commonly per cubic 
meter), Q𝜐 is the energy required for the formation of a vacancy (J/mol or eV/atom), T 
is the absolute temperature in kelvins,1 and k is the gas or Boltzmann’s constant. The 
value of k is 1.38 × 10−23 J/atom ∙K, or 8.62 × 10−5 eV/atom ∙K, depending on the units of 
Q𝜐.2 Thus, the number of vacancies increases exponentially with temperature—that is, 
as T in Equation 4.1 increases, so also does the term exp( −Q𝜐/kT). For most metals, the 
fraction of vacancies N𝜐/N just below the melting temperature is on the order of 10−4—that 
is, one lattice site out of 10,000 will be empty. As ensuing discussions indicate, a number of other material parameters have an exponential dependence on temperature similar to that in Equation 4.1.
A self-interstitial is an atom from the crystal that is crowded into an interstitial 
site—a small void space that under ordinary circumstances is not occupied. This kind of 
defect is also represented in Figure 4.1. In metals, a self-interstitial introduces relatively large distortions in the surrounding lattice because the atom is substantially larger than the interstitial position in which it is situated. Consequently, the formation of this defect is not highly probable, and it exists in very small concentrations that are significantly lower than for vacancies.Temperature

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 4.1
Number-of-Vacancies Computation at a Specified Temperature
Calculate the equilibrium number of vacancies per cubic meter for copper at 1000 °C. The 
energy for vacancy formation is 0.9 eV/atom; the atomic weight and density (at 1000 °C) for 
copper are 63.5 g/mol and 8.4 g/cm3, respectively.
Solution
This problem may be solved by using Equation 4.1; it is first necessary, however, to determine 
the value of NCu—the number of atomic sites per cubic meter for copper, from its atomic weight 
ACu, its density 𝜌, and Avogadro’s number NA, according to

atoms per unit volume for a metal
A pure metal consisting of only one type of atom just isn’t possible; impurity or foreign 
atoms are always present, and some exist as crystalline point defects. In fact, even with relatively sophisticated techniques, it is difficult to refine metals to a purity in excess of 99.9999%. At this level, on the order of 10
22 to 1023 impurity atoms are present in 1 m3 
of material. Most familiar metals are not highly pure; rather, they are alloys, in which 
impurity atoms have been added intentionally to impart specific characteristics to the material. Ordinarily, alloying is used in metals to improve mechanical strength and  corrosion resistance. For example, sterling silver is a 92.5% silver–7.5% copper alloy. In normal ambient environments, pure silver is highly corrosion resistant, but also very soft. Alloying with copper significantly enhances the mechanical strength without re-ducing the corrosion resistance appreciably.
The addition of impurity atoms to a metal results in the formation of a solid solution 
and/or a new second phase, depending on the kinds of impurity, their concentrations, and the temperature of the alloy. The present discussion is concerned with the notion of a solid solution; treatment of the formation of a new phase is deferred to Chapter 9.
Several terms relating to impurities and solid solutions deserve mention. With re-
gard to alloys, solute and solvent are terms that are commonly employed. Solvent is the 
element or compound that is present in the greatest amount; on occasion, solvent atoms are also called host atoms. Solute is used to denote an element or compound present in 
a minor concentration.alloy

Solid Solutions
A solid solution forms when, as the solute atoms are added to the host material, the crys-
tal structure is maintained and no new structures are formed. Perhaps it is useful to draw an analogy with a liquid solution. If two liquids that are soluble in each other (such as water and alcohol) are combined, a liquid solution is produced as the molecules intermix, and its composition is homogeneous throughout. A solid solution is also compositionally homogeneous; the impurity atoms are randomly and uniformly dispersed within the solid.
Impurity point defects are found in solid solutions, of which there are two types: 
substitutional and interstitial. For the substitutional type, solute or impurity atoms re-place or substitute for the host atoms (Figure 4.2). Several features of the solute and solvent atoms determine the degree to which the former dissolves in the latter. These are expressed as four Hume–Rothery rules, as follows:
 1. Atomic size factor. Appreciable quantities of a solute may be accommodated in 
this type of solid solution only when the difference in atomic radii between the two atom types is less than about ±15%. Otherwise, the solute atoms create 
substantial lattice distortions and a new phase forms.
 2. Crystal structure. For appreciable solid solubility, the crystal structures for metals of both atom types must be the same.
 3. Electronegativity factor. The more electropositive one element and the more elec-tronegative the other, the greater the likelihood that they will form an intermetal-lic compound instead of a substitutional solid solution.
 4. Valences. Other factors being equal, a metal has more of a tendency to dissolve another metal of higher valency than to dissolve one of a lower valency.
An example of a substitutional solid solution is found for copper and nickel. These 
two elements are completely soluble in one another at all proportions. With regard to 
the aforementioned rules that govern degree of solubility, the atomic radii for copper and nickel are 0.128 and 0.125 nm, respectively; both have the FCC crystal structure; and their electronegativities are 1.9 and 1.8 (Figure 2.9). Finally, the most common valences are +1 for copper (although it sometimes can be +2) and +2 for nickel.
For interstitial solid solutions, impurity atoms fill the voids or interstices among the 
host atoms (see Figure 4.2). For both FCC and BCC crystal structures, there are two types of interstitial sites— tetrahedral and octahedral; these are distinguished by the num-
ber of nearest neighbor host atoms—that is, the coordination number. Tetrahedral sites substitutional solid

have a coordination number of 4; straight lines drawn from the centers of the surrounding 
host atoms form a four-sided tetrahedron. However, for octahedral sites the coordination number is 6; an octahedron is produced by joining these six sphere centers.

Metallic materials have relatively high atomic packing factors, which means that 
these interstitial positions are relatively small. Consequently, the atomic diameter of an interstitial impurity must be substantially smaller than that of the host atoms. Normally, the maximum allowable concentration of interstitial impurity atoms is low (less than 10%). Even very small impurity atoms are ordinarily larger than the interstitial sites, and as a consequence, they introduce some lattice strains on the adjacent host atoms. Problems 4.8 and 4.9 call for determination of the radii of impurity atoms r (in terms of 
R, the host atom radius) that just fit into tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial positions of both BCC and FCC without introducing any lattice strains.
Carbon forms an interstitial solid solution when added to iron; the maximum con-
centration of carbon is about 2%. The atomic radius of the carbon atom is much less than that of iron: 0.071 nm versus 0.124 nm.
Solid solutions are also possible for ceramic materials, as discussed in Section 12.5.
3The geometries of these site types may be observed in Figure 12.7 .
4Other octahedral and tetrahedral interstices are located at positions within the unit cell that are equivalent to these 
representative ones.Figure 4.3

Computation of Radius of BCC Interstitial Site
Compute the radius r of an impurity atom that just fits into a BCC octahedral site in terms of 
the atomic radius R of the host atom (without introducing lattice strains).
Solution
As Figure 4.3b  notes, for BCC, one octahedral interstitial site is situated at the center of a unit 
cell edge. In order for an interstitial atom to be positioned in this site without introducing lattice

strains, the atom just touches the two adjacent host atoms, which 
are corner atoms of the unit cell. The drawing shows atoms on the (100) face of a BCC unit cell; the large circles represent the host atoms—the small circle represents an interstitial atom that is positioned in an octahedral site on the cube edge. On this drawing is noted the unit cell edge length—the distance between the centers of the corner atoms—which, from Equation 3.4, is equal to
Unit cell edge length =4R
√3
Also shown is that the unit cell edge length is equal to two times the sum of host atomic radius 2R plus twice the radius of the interstitial atom 2r; i.e.,
Unit cell edge length =2R+2r
Now, equating these two unit cell edge length expressions, we get

It is often necessary to express the composition (or concentration)5 of an alloy in terms 
of its constituent elements. The two most common ways to specify composition are weight (or mass) percent and atom percent. The basis for weight percent (wt%) is 
the weight of a particular element relative to the total alloy weight. For an alloy that composition

C1, is defined as
 C1=m1
m1+m2×100  (4.3a)
where m1 and m2 represent the weight (or mass) of elements 1 and 2, respectively. The 
concentration of 2 is computed in an analogous manner.6
The basis for atom percent (at%) calculations is the number of moles of an element 
in relation to the total moles of the elements in the alloy. The number of moles in some specified mass of a hypothetical element 1, n
m1, may be computed as follows:
 nm1=m1′
A1 (4.4)
Here, m′1 and A1 denote the mass (in grams) and atomic weight, respectively, for element 1.
Concentration in terms of atom percent of element 1 in an alloy containing element 
1 and element 2 atoms, C′1 is defined by7
 C′1=nm1
nm1+nm2×100  (4.5a)
In like manner, the atom percent of element 2 is determined.8
Atom percent computations also can be carried out on the basis of the number of 
atoms instead of moles, because one mole of all substances contains the same number of atoms.
Composition Conversions
Sometimes it is necessary to convert from one composition scheme to another —for example, from weight percent to atom percent. We next present equations for making these conversions in terms of the two hypothetical elements 1 and 2. Using the conven-tion of the previous section (i.e., weight percents denoted by C
1 and C2, atom percents 
by C′1 and C′2, and atomic weights as A1 and A2), we express these conversion equations 
as follows:

7In order to avoid confusion in notations and symbols being used in this section, we should point out that the prime 
(as in C′1 and m′1) is used to designate both composition in atom percent and mass of material in grams.

Because we are considering only two elements, computations involving the preced-
ing equations are simplified when it is realized that
  C1+C2=100 (4.8a)
  C′1+C′2=100 (4.8b)
In addition, it sometimes becomes necessary to convert concentration from weight 
percent to mass of one component per unit volume of material (i.e., from units of 
wt% to kg/m3); this latter composition scheme is often used in diffusion computations 
(Section 5.3). Concentrations in terms of this basis are denoted using a double prime (i.e., C″
1 and C″2), and the relevant equations are as follows:
 C″1=

For density 𝜌 in units of g/cm3, these expressions yield C″1 and C″2 in kg/m3.
Furthermore, on occasion we desire to determine the density and atomic weight of 
a binary alloy, given the composition in terms of either weight percent or atom percent. If we represent alloy density and atomic weight by 𝜌

To simplify this derivation, we assume that masses are expressed in units of grams and denoted

A dislocation is a linear or one-dimensional defect around which some of the atoms are 
misaligned. One type of dislocation is represented in Figure 4.4: an extra portion of a plane 
of atoms, or half-plane, the edge of which terminates within the crystal. This is termed an 
edge dislocation; it is a linear defect that centers on the line that is defined along the end of 
the extra half-plane of atoms. This is sometimes termed the dislocation line, which, for the 
edge dislocation in Figure 4.4, is perpendicular to the plane of the page. Within the region around the dislocation line there is some localized lattice distortion. The atoms above the dislocation line in Figure 4.4 are squeezed together, and those below are pulled apart; this is reflected in the slight curvature for the vertical planes of atoms as they bend around this extra half-plane. The magnitude of this distortion decreases with distance away from the dislocation line; at positions far removed, the crystal lattice is virtually perfect. Sometimes the edge dislocation in Figure 4.4 is represented by the symbol ⊥ , which also indicates the 
position of the dislocation line. An edge dislocation may also be formed by an extra half-plane of atoms that is included in the bottom portion of the crystal; its designation is a ⊤.
Another type of dislocation, called a screw dislocation,  may be thought of as being 
formed by a shear stress that is applied to produce the distortion shown in Figure 4.5a : The edge dislocation

upper front region of the crystal is shifted one atomic distance to the right relative to the 
bottom portion. The atomic distortion associated with a screw dislocation is also linear and along a dislocation line, line AB in Figure 4.5b . The screw dislocation derives its name 
from the spiral or helical path or ramp that is traced around the dislocation line by the atomic planes of atoms. Sometimes the symbol 
 is used to designate a screw dislocation.   : VMSE

Most dislocations found in crystalline materials are probably neither pure edge nor 
pure screw but exhibit components of both types; these are termed mixed dislocations.  
All three dislocation types are represented schematically in Figure 4.6; the lattice dis-
tortion that is produced away from the two faces is mixed, having varying degrees of screw and edge character.mixed dislocation

The magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion associated with a dislocation 
are expressed in terms of a Burgers vector,  denoted by b. Burgers vectors are indicated 
in Figures 4.4 and 4.5 for edge and screw dislocations, respectively. Furthermore, the 
nature of a dislocation (i.e., edge, screw, or mixed) is defined by the relative orientations of dislocation line and Burgers vector. For an edge, they are perpendicular (Figure 4.4), whereas for a screw, they are parallel (Figure 4.5); they are neither perpendicular nor parallel for a mixed dislocation. Also, even though a dislocation changes direction and nature within a crystal (e.g., from edge to mixed to screw), the Burgers vector is the same at all points along its line. For example, all positions of the curved dislocation in Figure 4.6 have the Burgers vector shown. For metallic materials, the Burgers vector for a disloca-tion points in a close-packed crystallographic direction and is of magnitude equal to the interatomic spacing.
As we note in Section 7.2, the permanent deformation of most crystalline materials is 
by the motion of dislocations. In addition, the Burgers vector is an element of the theory that has been developed to explain this type of deformation.
Dislocations can be observed in crystalline materials using electron-microscopic 
techniques. In Figure 4.7, a high-magnification transmission electron micrograph, the dark lines are the dislocations.
Virtually all crystalline materials contain some dislocations that were introduced 
during solidification, during plastic deformation, and as a consequence of thermal stresses that result from rapid cooling. Dislocations are involved in the plastic deforma-tion of crystalline materials, both metals and ceramics, as discussed in Chapters 7 and 12. They have also been observed in polymeric materials and are discussed in Section 14.13.Burgers vector

Interfacial defects are boundaries that have two dimensions and normally separate 
regions of the materials that have different crystal structures and/or crystallographic orientations. These imperfections include external surfaces, grain boundaries, phase boundaries, twin boundaries, and stacking faults.4.6 INTERFACIAL DEFECTS
106  •   Chapter 4  /  Imperfections in Solids
External Surfaces
One of the most obvious boundaries is the external surface, along which the crystal 
structure terminates. Surface atoms are not bonded to the maximum number of nearest neighbors and are therefore in a higher energy state than the atoms at interior positions. The bonds of these surface atoms that are not satisfied give rise to a surface energy, expressed in units of energy per unit area (J/m
2 or erg/cm2). To reduce this energy, 
materials tend to minimize, if at all possible, the total surface area. For example, liquids assume a shape having a minimum area—the droplets become spherical. Of course, this is not possible with solids, which are mechanically rigid.
Grain Boundaries
Another interfacial defect, the grain boundary, was introduced in Section 3.14 as the boundary separating two small grains or crystals having different crystallographic orien-tations in polycrystalline materials. A grain boundary is represented schematically from an atomic perspective in Figure 4.8. Within the boundary region, which is probably just several atom distances wide, there is some atomic mismatch in a transition from the crystalline orientation of one grain to that of an adjacent one.
Various degrees of crystallographic misalignment between adjacent grains are 
possible (Figure 4.8). When this orientation mismatch is slight, on the order of a few degrees, then the term small- (or low-) angle grain boundary is used. These boundaries 
can be described in terms of dislocation arrays. One simple small-angle grain boundary is formed when edge dislocations are aligned in the manner of Figure 4.9. This type is called a tilt boundary; the angle of misorientation, 𝜃, is also indicated in the figure. When 
the angle of misorientation is parallel to the boundary, a twist boundary results, which 
can be described by an array of screw dislocations.
The atoms are bonded less regularly along a grain boundary (e.g., bond angles are 
longer), and consequently there is an interfacial or grain boundary energy similar to the surface energy just described. The magnitude of this energy is a function of the degree of misorientation, being larger for high-angle boundaries. Grain boundaries are more chemically reactive than the grains themselves as a consequence of this boundary energy. Furthermore, impurity atoms often preferentially segregate along these boundaries because

of their higher energy state. The total interfacial energy is lower in large or coarse-grained 
materials than in fine-grained ones because there is less total boundary area in the former. Grains grow at elevated temperatures to reduce the total boundary energy, a phenomenon explained in Section 7.13.
In spite of this disordered arrangement of atoms and lack of regular bonding along 
grain boundaries, a polycrystalline material is still very strong; cohesive forces within and across the boundary are present. Furthermore, the density of a polycrystalline speci-men is virtually identical to that of a single crystal of the same material.
Phase Boundaries
Phase boundaries exist in multiphase materials (Section 9.3), in which a different phase exists on each side of the boundary; In addition, each of the constituent phases has its own distinctive physical and/or chemical characteristics. As we shall see in subsequent chapters, phase boundaries play an important role in determining the mechanical char-acteristics of some multiphase metal alloys.
Twin Boundaries
A twin boundary is a special type of grain boundary across which there is a specific 
mirror lattice symmetry; that is, atoms on one side of the boundary are located in mirror-image positions to those of the atoms on the other side (Figure 4.10). The region Figure 4.9  Demonstration of 
how a tilt boundary having an angle

Catalysts (and Surface Defects)MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 4 . 1
A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of 
a chemical reaction without participating in the 
reaction itself (i.e., it is not consumed). One type of catalyst exists as a solid; reactant molecules in a gas or liquid phase are adsorbed
9 onto the catalytic surface, 
at which point some type of interaction occurs that promotes an increase in their chemical reactivity rate.
Adsorption sites on a catalyst are normally sur-
face defects associated with planes of atoms; an  interatomic/intermolecular bond is formed between a defect site and an adsorbed molecular species. The several types of surface defects, represented schemati-cally in Figure 4.11, include ledges, kinks, terraces, va-cancies, and individual adatoms (i.e., atoms adsorbed on the surface).
One important use of catalysts is in catalytic con-
verters on automobiles, which reduce the emission of exhaust gas pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO
x, where x is variable), and 
unburned hydrocarbons. (See the chapter-opening diagrams and photograph for this chapter.) Air is in-troduced into the exhaust emissions from the auto-mobile engine; this mixture of gases then passes over the catalyst, which on its surface adsorbs molecules of CO, NO
x, and O2. The NOx dissociates into N and 
O atoms, whereas the O2 dissociates into its atomic 
species. Pairs of nitrogen atoms combine to form N2 
molecules, and carbon monoxide is oxidized to form carbon dioxide (CO2). Furthermore, any unburned 
hydrocarbons are also oxidized to CO2 and H2O.
One of the materials used as a catalyst in this 
application is (Ce0.5Zr0.5)O2. Figure 4.12 is a high-
resolution transmission electron micrograph that shows several single crystals of this material. In-dividual atoms are resolved in this micrograph as well as some of the defects presented in Figure 4.11. These surface defects act as adsorption sites for the atomic and molecular species noted in the previous paragraph. Consequently, dissociation, combination, and oxidation reactions involving these species are facilitated, such that the content of pollutant spe-cies (CO, NO
x, and unburned hydrocarbons) in the 
exhaust gas stream is reduced significantly.
9Adsorption is the adhesion of molecules of a gas or liquid to a solid surface. It should not be confused with 
 absorption, which is the assimilation of molecules into a solid or liquid.

of material between these boundaries is appropriately termed a twin. Twins result from 
atomic displacements that are produced from applied mechanical shear forces (mechan-
ical twins) and also during annealing heat treatments following deformation (annealing twins). Twinning occurs on a definite crystallographic plane and in a specific direction, both of which depend on the crystal structure. Annealing twins are typically found in metals that have the FCC crystal structure, whereas mechanical twins are observed in BCC and HCP metals. The role of mechanical twins in the deformation process is dis-cussed in Section 7.7. Annealing twins may be observed in the photomicrograph of the polycrystalline brass specimen shown in Figure 4.14 c. The twins correspond to those 
regions having relatively straight and parallel sides and a different visual contrast than the untwinned regions of the grains within which they reside. An explanation for the variety of textural contrasts in this photomicrograph is provided in Section 4.10.
Miscellaneous Interfacial Defects
Other possible interfacial defects include stacking faults and ferromagnetic domain walls. Stacking faults are found in FCC metals when there is an interruption in the ABCABCABC . . . stacking sequence of close-packed planes (Section 3.12). For ferromag-
netic and ferrimagnetic materials, the boundary that separates regions having different directions of magnetization is termed a domain wall, which is discussed in Section 20.7.
Associated with each of the defects discussed in this section is an interfacial energy, the 
magnitude of which depends on boundary type, and which varies from material to material. Normally, the interfacial energy is greatest for external surfaces and least for domain walls.Tutorial Video: 
Defects
Differences among 
Point, Linear, and 
Interfacial Defects
Other defects exist in all solid materials that are much larger than those heretofore discussed. These include pores, cracks, foreign inclusions, and other phases. They are normally introduced during processing and fabrication steps. Some of these defects and their effects on the properties of materials are discussed in subsequent chapters.
Every atom in a solid material is vibrating very rapidly about its lattice position within the crystal. In a sense, these atomic vibrations may be thought of as imperfections or de-
fects. At any instant of time, not all atoms vibrate at the same frequency and amplitude or with the same energy. At a given temperature, there exists a distribution of energies for the constituent atoms about an average energy. Over time, the vibrational energy of any specific atom also varies in a random manner. With rising temperature, this average energy increases, and, in fact, the temperature of a solid is really just a measure of the average vibrational activity of atoms and molecules. At room temperature, a typical vibrational frequency is on the order of 10
13 vibrations per second, whereas the ampli-
tude is a few thousandths of a nanometer.
Many properties and processes in solids are manifestations of this vibrational 
atomic motion. For example, melting occurs when the vibrations are vigorous enough to rupture large numbers of atomic bonds. A more detailed discussion of atomic vibrations and their influence on the properties of materials is presented in Chapter 19.atomic vibration4.7 BULK OR VOLUME DEFECTS

Microscopic Examination
On occasion it is necessary or desirable to examine the structural elements and defects 
that influence the properties of materials. Some structural elements are of macroscopic 
dimensions; that is, they are large enough to be observed with the unaided eye. For example, the shape and average size or diameter of the grains for a polycrystalline specimen are important structural characteristics. Macroscopic grains are often evident on aluminum streetlight posts and also on highway guardrails. Relatively large grains having different textures are clearly visible on the surface of the sectioned copper ingot shown in Figure 4.13. However, in most materials the constituent grains are of micro-
scopic dimensions, having diameters that may be on the order of microns,
10 and their 
details must be investigated using some type of microscope. Grain size and shape are only two features of what is termed the microstructure; these and other microstructural 
characteristics are discussed in subsequent chapters.
Optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopes are commonly used in 
 microscopy.  These instruments aid in investigations of the microstructural features 
of all material types. Some of these techniques employ photographic equipment in conjunction with the microscope; the photograph on which the image is recorded is called a photomicrograph.  In addition, many microstructural images are computer 
generated and/or enhanced.
Microscopic examination is an extremely useful tool in the study and characteriza-
tion of materials. Several important applications of microstructural examinations are as follows: to ensure that the associations between the properties and structure (and defects) are properly understood, to predict the properties of materials once these re-lationships have been established, to design alloys with new property combinations, to determine whether a material has been correctly heat-treated, and to ascertain the mode of mechanical fracture. Several techniques that are commonly used in such investiga-tions are discussed next.microstructure

4.10 Microscopic Techniques  •   111
Optical Microscopy
With optical microscopy, the light microscope is used to study the microstructure; opti-
cal and illumination systems are its basic elements. For materials that are opaque to 
visible light (all metals and many ceramics and polymers), only the surface is subject to observation, and the light microscope must be used in a reflecting mode. Contrasts in the image produced result from differences in reflectivity of the various regions of the microstructure. Investigations of this type are often termed metallographic because 
metals were first examined using this technique.
Normally, careful and meticulous surface preparations are necessary to reveal the 
important details of the microstructure. The specimen surface must first be ground and polished to a smooth and mirror-like finish. This is accomplished by using successively finer abrasive papers and powders. The microstructure is revealed by a surface treat-ment using an appropriate chemical reagent in a procedure termed etching. The chemi-
cal reactivity of the grains of some single-phase materials depends on crystallographic orientation. Consequently, in a polycrystalline specimen, etching characteristics vary from grain to grain. Figure 4.14 b shows how normally incident light is reflected by three 
etched surface grains, each having a different orientation. Figure 4.14 a depicts the sur-
face structure as it might appear when viewed with the microscope; the luster or texture of each grain depends on its reflectance properties. A photomicrograph of a polycrystal-line specimen exhibiting these characteristics is shown in Figure 4.14 c.4.10 MICROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES

112  •   Chapter 4  /  Imperfections in Solids
Also, small grooves form along grain boundaries as a consequence of etching. 
Because atoms along grain boundary regions are more chemically active, they dissolve 
at a greater rate than those within the grains. These grooves become discernible when viewed under a microscope because they reflect light at an angle different from that of the grains themselves; this effect is displayed in Figure 4.15 a. Figure 4.15b is a photomi-
crograph of a polycrystalline specimen in which the grain boundary grooves are clearly visible as dark lines.
When the microstructure of a two-phase alloy is to be examined, an etchant is often 
chosen that produces a different texture for each phase so that the different phases may be distinguished from each other.
Electron Microscopy
Some structural elements are too fine or small to permit observation using optical microscopy. The upper limit to the magnification possible with an optical microscope is approximately 2000 ×. Under such circumstances, the electron microscope, which is 
capable of much higher magnifications, may be employed.
An image of the structure under investigation is formed using beams of electrons 
instead of light radiation. According to quantum mechanics, a high-velocity electron becomes wavelike, having a wavelength that is inversely proportional to its velocity. When accelerated across large voltages, electrons can be made to have wavelengths on the order of 0.003 nm (3 pm). High magnifications and resolving powers of these microscopes are consequences of the short wavelengths of electron beams. The elec-tron beam is focused and the image formed with magnetic lenses; otherwise, the ge-ometry of the microscope components is essentially the same as with optical systems. Both transmission and reflection beam modes of operation are possible for electron microscopes.Figure 4.15  (a) Section of a grain boundary and its surface groove produced by etching; the light reflection char-
acteristics in the vicinity of the groove are also shown. (b) Photomicrograph of the surface of a polished and etched

4.10 Microscopic Techniques  •   113
Transmission Electron Microscopy
The image seen with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) is formed by 
an electron beam that passes through the specimen. Details of internal microstruc-
tural features are accessible to observation; contrasts in the image are produced by differences in beam scattering or diffraction produced between various elements of the microstructure or defect. Because solid materials are highly absorptive to elec-tron beams, a specimen to be examined must be prepared in the form of a very thin foil; this ensures transmission through the specimen of an appreciable fraction of the incident beam. The transmitted beam is projected onto a fluorescent screen or a photographic film so that the image may be viewed. Magnifications approaching 1,000,000 × are possible with transmission electron microscopy, which is frequently 
used to study dislocations.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
A more recent and extremely useful investigative tool is the scanning electron 
microscope (SEM). The surface of a specimen to be examined is scanned with an 
electron beam, and the reflected (or back-scattered) beam of electrons is collected and 
then displayed at the same scanning rate on a cathode ray tube (CRT; similar to a CRT 
television screen). The image on the screen, which may be photographed, represents the surface features of the specimen. The surface may or may not be polished and etched, but it must be electrically conductive; a very thin metallic surface coating must be applied to nonconductive materials. Magnifications ranging from 10 × to in excess of 
50,000 × are possible, as are also very great depths of field. Accessory equipment permits 
qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of the elemental composition of very localized surface areas.
Scanning Probe Microscopy
In the past two decades, the field of microscopy has experienced a revolution with the development of a new family of scanning probe microscopes. The scanning probe 
 microscope (SPM), of which there are several varieties, differs from optical and electron 
microscopes in that neither light nor electrons are used to form an image. Rather, the 
microscope generates a topographical map, on an atomic scale, that is a representation of surface features and characteristics of the specimen being examined. Some of the features that differentiate the SPM from other microscopic techniques are as follows:
 • Examination on the nanometer scale is possible inasmuch as magnifi  cations as 
high as 10
9× are possible; much better resolutions are attainable than with other 
microscopic techniques.
 • Three-dimensional magnifi  ed images are generated that provide topographical 
information about features of interest.
 • Some SPMs may be operated in a variety of environments (e.g., vacuum, air, 
liquid); thus, a particular specimen may be examined in its most suitable 
environment.
Scanning probe microscopes employ a tiny probe with a very sharp tip that is 
brought into very close proximity (i.e., to within on the order of a nanometer) of the 
specimen surface. This probe is then raster-scanned across the plane of the surface. During scanning, the probe experiences deflections perpendicular to this plane in re-sponse to electronic or other interactions between the probe and specimen surface. The in-surface-plane and out-of-plane motions of the probe are controlled by piezoelectric (Section 18.25) ceramic components that have nanometer resolutions. Furthermore, these probe movements are monitored electronically and transferred to and stored in a computer, which then generates the three-dimensional surface image.transmission electron

These new SPMs, which allow examination of the surface of materials at the atomic 
and molecular level, have provided a wealth of information about a host of materials, 
from integrated circuit chips to biological molecules. Indeed, the advent of the SPMs has helped to usher in the era of nanomaterials —materials whose properties are designed by 
engineering atomic and molecular structures.

structures found in materials (note that the axes are scaled logarithmically). The use-ful dimensional resolution ranges for the several microscopic techniques discussed in this chapter (plus the naked eye) are presented in the bar chart of Figure 4.16b . For 
three of these techniques (SPM, TEM, and SEM), an upper resolution value is not imposed by the characteristics of the microscope and, therefore, is somewhat arbitrary and not well defined.

4.11 Grain-Size Determination  •   115
The grain size is often determined when the properties of polycrystalline and single-
phase materials are under consideration. In this regard, it is important to realize that for 
each material, the constituent grains have a variety of shapes and a distribution of sizes. Grain size may be specified in terms of average or mean grain diameter, and a number of techniques have been developed to measure this parameter.
Before the advent of the digital age, grain-size determinations were performed 
manually using photomicrographs. However, today, most techniques are automated and use digital images and image analyzers with the capacity to record, detect, and measure accurately features of the grain structure (i.e., grain intercept counts, grain boundary lengths, and grain areas).
We now briefly describe two common grain-size determination techniques: (1) linear 
intercept —counting numbers of grain boundary intersections by straight test lines; and (2) 
comparison —comparing grain structures with standardized charts, which are based upon 
grain areas (i.e., number of grains per unit area). Discussions of these techniques is from the manual perspective (using photomicrographs).
For the linear intercept method, lines are drawn randomly through several 
photomicrographs that show the grain structure (all taken at the same magnification). Grain boundaries intersected by all the line segments are counted. Let us represent the sum of the total number of intersections as P  and the total length of all the lines 
by L
T. The mean intercept length ℓ [in real space (at 1 ×—i.e., not magnified)], a 
measure of grain diameter, may be determined by the following expression:
 ℓ=LT
PM (4.16)
where M is the magnification.
The comparison method of grain-size determination was devised by the American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).11 The ASTM has prepared several stand-
ard comparison charts, all having different average grain sizes and referenced to pho-
tomicrographs taken at a magnification of 100 ×. To each chart is assigned a number 
ranging from 1 to 10, which is termed the grain-size number. A specimen must be prepared properly to reveal the grain structure, which is then photographed. Grain size is expressed as the grain-size number of the chart that most nearly matches the grains in the micrograph. Thus, a relatively simple and convenient visual determina-tion of grain-size number is possible. Grain-size number is used extensively in the specification of steels.
The rationale behind the assignment of the grain-size number to these various 
charts is as follows: Let G represent the grain-size number, and let n be the average 
number of grains per square inch at a magnification of 100 ×. These two parameters are 
related to each other through the expression

place of the previous n. Equation 4.17 is the standard notation currently used in the literature.Relationship 
 between ASTM grain size number and number of grains per square 
inch (at 100 ×)to decide which microscopic technique(s) is (are) best suited for examination of each of 
the structure types.
116  •   Chapter 4  /  Imperfections in Solids
For photomicrographs taken at magnifications other than 100 ×, use of the following 
modified form of Equation 4.17 is necessary:
 nM(M
100)2
=2G−1 (4.18)
In this expression, nM is the number of grains per square inch at magnification M. In ad-
dition, the inclusion of the (M
100)2 term makes use of the fact that, whereas magnification 
is a length parameter, area is expressed in terms of units of length squared. As a conse-
quence, the number of grains per unit area increases with the square of the increase in magnification.
Relationships have been developed that relate mean intercept length to ASTM 
grain-size number; these are as follows:
  G=−6.6457 log ℓ
−3.298    (for ℓ in mm) (4.19a)
  G=−6.6353 log ℓ−12.6  (for ℓ in in.) (4.19b)
At this point, it is worthwhile to discuss the representation of magnification (i.e., 
linear magnification) for a micrograph. Sometimes magnification is specified in the 
micrograph legend (e.g., “60 ×” for Figure 4.14b ); this means the micrograph repre-
sents a 60 times enlargement of the specimen in real space. Scale bars are also used to express degree of magnification. A scale bar is a straight line (typically horizontal), either superimposed on or located near the micrograph image. Associated with the bar is a length, typically expressed in microns; this value represents the distance in magnified space corresponding to the scale line length. For example, in Figure 4.15b , 
a scale bar is located below the bottom right-hand corner of the micrograph; its “100 μm” notation indicates that 100 μm correlates with the scale bar length.
To compute magnification from a scale bar, the following procedure may be used:
 1. Measure the length of the scale bar in millimeters using a ruler.
 2. Convert this length into microns [i.e., multiply the value in step (1) by 1000 
 because there are 1000 microns in a millimeter].
 3. Magnification M is equal to
 M=measured scale length (converted to microns)
the number appearing by the scale bar (in microns) (4.20)
For example, for Figure 4.15b, the measured scale length is approximately 10 mm, 
which is equivalent to (10 mm)(1000 μm/mm) = 10,000 μm. Inasmuch as the scale bar 
length is 100 μm, the magnification is equal to
M=10,000 μm
100 μm=100×
This is the value given in the figure legend.

with decreasing grain size? Why?

Grain-Size Computations Using ASTM and Intercept Methods
The following is a schematic micrograph that represents the microstructure of some hypothetical 
metal. Determine the following:
(a) Mean intercept length
(b)  ASTM grain-size number, G using Equation 4.19a
Solution
(a)  We first determine the magnification of the 
micrograph using Equation 4.20. The scale bar length is measured and found to be 16 mm, which is equal to 16,000 μm; and because the 
scale bar number is 100 μm, the magnification 
is
M=16,000 μm
100 μm=160×
The following sketch is the same micrograph on which have been drawn seven straight lines (in red), which have been numbered.
The length of each line is 50 mm, and thus 
the total line length ( L
T in Equation 4.16) is
(7 lines)(50 mm/line) =350 mm
Tabulated next is the number of grain-boundary intersections for each line:

Thus, inasmuch as LT = 350 mm, P  = 58 grain-boundary intersections, and the magnification 
M = 160×, the mean intercept length ℓ (in millimeters in real space), Equation 4.16, is equal to
 ℓ=LT

SUMMARY
• Point defects are those associated with one or two atomic positions; these include 
vacancies (or vacant lattice sites) and self-interstitials (host atoms that occupy inter-
stitial sites).
• The equilibrium number of vacancies depends on temperature according to Equation 4.1.
• An alloy is a metallic substance that is composed of two or more elements.
• A solid solution may form when impurity atoms are added to a solid, in which case 
the original crystal structure is retained and no new phases are formed.
• For substitutional solid solutions, impurity atoms substitute for host atoms.
• Interstitial solid solutions form for relatively small impurity atoms that occupy inter-
stitial sites among the host atoms.
• A high degree of substitutional solid solubility of one atom type in another is possible 
when the Hume-Rothery rules are obeyed.
• Composition of an alloy may be specified in weight percent (on the basis of mass frac-
tion, Equations 4.3a and 4.3b) or atom percent (on the basis of mole or atom fraction, 
Equations 4.5a and 4.5b).
• Expressions were provided that allow conversion of weight percent to atom percent 
(Equation 4.6a) and vice versa (Equation 4.7a).
• Dislocations are one-dimensional crystalline defects of which there are two pure types: edge and screw.
An edge may be thought of in terms of the lattice distortion along the end of an 
extra half-plane of atoms.
A screw is as a helical planar ramp.
For mixed dislocations, components of both pure edge and screw are found.
• The magnitude and direction of lattice distortion associated with a dislocation are 
specified by its Burgers vector.
• The relative orientations of Burgers vector and dislocation line are (1) perpendicu-
lar for edge, (2) parallel for screw, and (3) neither perpendicular nor parallel for mixed.
• Within the vicinity of a grain boundary (which is several atomic distances wide), there 
is some atomic mismatch between two adjacent grains that have different crystallo-graphic orientations.
• Across a twin boundary, atoms on one side reside in mirror-image positions of atoms 
on the other side.Vacancies and

Summary  •   119
• The microstructure of a material consists of defects and structural elements that are of 
microscopic dimensions. Microscopy is the observation of microstructure using some 
type of microscope.
• Both optical and electron microscopes are employed, usually in conjunction with 
photographic equipment.
• Transmissive and reflective modes are possible for each microscope type; preference 
is dictated by the nature of the specimen as well as the structural element or defect to be examined.
• The two types of electron microscopes are transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM).
For TEM, an image is formed from an electron beam that, although passing 
through the specimen, is scattered and/or diffracted.
SEM employs an electron beam that raster-scans the specimen surface; an image 
is produced from back-scattered or reflected electrons.
• A scanning probe microscope employs a small and sharp-tipped probe that raster-
scans the specimen surface. A computer-generated and three-dimensional image of the surface results having nanometer resolution.
• With the intercept method used to measure grain size, a series of straight-line seg-
ments are drawn on the photomicrograph. The number of grain boundaries that are intersected by these lines are counted, and the mean intercept length (a measure of 
grain diameter) is computed using Equation 4.16.
• Comparison of a photomicrograph (taken at a magnification of 100 ×) with ASTM 
standard comparison charts may be used to specify grain size in terms of a grain-size number.Microscopic

Chapter 5  Diffusion
T he first photograph on this page is of a steel gear that has been 
case hardened—that is, its outer surface layer was selectively hardened 
by a high-temperature heat treatment during which carbon from the 
surrounding atmosphere diffused into the surface. The “case” appears as the dark outer rim of that segment of the gear that has been sectioned. This increase in the carbon content raises the surface hardness (as explained in Section 10.7), which in turn leads to an improvement of wear resistance of the gear. In addition, residual compressive stresses are introduced within the case region; these give rise to an enhancement of the gear’s resistance to failure by fatigue while in service (Chapter 8).
Case-hardened steel gears are used in automobile transmissions, 
similar to the one shown in the photograph directly below the gear.

WHY STUDY Diffusion?
Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Name and describe the two atomic mechanisms 
of diffusion.
2.  Distinguish between steady-state and nonsteady-
state diffusion.
3. (a)  Write Fick’s first and second laws in equation 
form and define all parameters.
(b)  Note the kind of diffusion for which each of 
these equations is normally applied.4.  Write the solution to Fick’s second law for diffu-sion into a semi-infinite solid when the concen-tration of diffusing species at the surface is held constant. Define all parameters in this equation.
5.  Calculate the diffusion coefficient for a  material at a specified temperature, given the appropriate diffusion constants.
Many reactions and processes that are important in the treatment of materials rely on the 
transfer of mass either within a specific solid (ordinarily on a microscopic level) or from a liquid, a gas, or another solid phase. This is necessarily accomplished by diffusion,  the 
phenomenon of material transport by atomic motion. This chapter discusses the atomic mechanisms by which diffusion occurs, the mathematics of diffusion, and the influence of temperature and diffusing species on the rate of diffusion.
The phenomenon of diffusion may be demonstrated with the use of a diffusion couple,  
which is formed by joining bars of two different metals together so that there is intimate contact between the two faces; this is illustrated for copper and nickel in Figure 5.1a , which 
includes schematic representations of atom positions and composition across the interface. This couple is heated for an extended period at an elevated temperature (but below the melting temperature of both metals) and cooled to room temperature. Chemical analysis reveals a condition similar to that represented in Figure 5.1b —namely, pure copper and 
nickel at the two extremities of the couple, separated by an alloyed region. Concentrations of both metals vary with position as shown in Figure 5.1b (bottom). This result indicates 
that copper atoms have migrated or diffused into the nickel, and that nickel has diffused into copper. The process by which atoms of one metal diffuse into another is termed 
inter diffusion,  or impurity diffusion.
Interdiffusion may be discerned from a macroscopic perspective by changes in con-
centration that occur over time, as in the example for the Cu–Ni diffusion couple. There 
is a net drift or transport of atoms from high- to low-concentration regions. Diffusion also occurs for pure metals, but all atoms exchanging positions are of the same type; this is termed self-diffusion. Of course, self-diffusion is not normally subject to observation 
by noting compositional changes.diffusion

self-diffusion5.1 INTRODUCTIONMaterials of all types are often heat-treated to improve 
their properties. The phenomena that occur during a heat treatment almost always involve atomic diffusion. Often, an enhancement of diffusion rate is desired; on occasion, measures are taken to reduce it. Heat-treating temperatures and times and/or cooling rates can often be predicted by using the mathematics of diffusion and appropriate diffusion constants. The steel gear shown on page 135 (top) has been case hardened (Section 8.10)—that is, its hardness and resistance to failure by fatigue have been enhanced by diffusing excess carbon or nitrogen into the outer surface layer.

5.2 Diffusion Mechanisms  •   123
From an atomic perspective, diffusion is just the stepwise migration of atoms from lattice 
site to lattice site. In fact, the atoms in solid materials are in constant motion, rapidly chang-ing positions. For an atom to make such a move, two conditions must be met: (1) there must be an empty adjacent site, and (2) the atom must have sufficient energy to break bonds with its neighbor atoms and then cause some lattice distortion during the displacement. This energy is vibrational in nature (Section 4.8). At a specific temperature, some small fraction of the total number of atoms is capable of diffusive motion, by virtue of the magnitudes of their vibrational energies. This fraction increases with rising temperature.
Several different models for this atomic motion have been proposed; of these pos-
sibilities, two dominate for metallic diffusion.
Vacancy Diffusion
One mechanism involves the interchange of an atom from a normal lattice position to an adjacent vacant lattice site or vacancy, as represented schematically in Figure 5.2 a. This 
mechanism is aptly termed vacancy diffusion. Of course, this process necessitates the 
presence of vacancies, and the extent to which vacancy diffusion can occur is a function of the number of these defects that are present; significant concentrations of vacancies may exist in metals at elevated temperatures (Section 4.2). Because diffusing atoms and vacancies exchange positions, the diffusion of atoms in one direction corresponds to the motion of vacancies in the opposite direction. Both self-diffusion and interdiffusion occur by this mechanism; for the latter, the impurity atoms must substitute for host atoms.
Interstitial Diffusion
The second type of diffusion involves atoms that migrate from an interstitial position to a neighboring one that is empty. This mechanism is found for interdiffusion of impurities vacancy diffusion

such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, which have atoms that are small enough 
to fit into the interstitial positions. Host or substitutional impurity atoms rarely form inter-stitials and do not normally diffuse via this mechanism. This phenomenon is appropriately termed interstitial diffusion (Figure 5.2b ).
In most metal alloys, interstitial diffusion occurs much more rapidly than diffusion 
by the vacancy mode, because the interstitial atoms are smaller and thus more mobile. Furthermore, there are more empty interstitial positions than vacancies; hence, the prob-ability of interstitial atomic movement is greater than for vacancy diffusion.interstitial diffusionFigure 5.2  Schematic representations of

Diffusion is a time-dependent process —that is, in a macroscopic sense, the quantity of 
an element that is transported within another is a function of time. Often it is necessary 
to know how fast diffusion occurs, or the rate of mass transfer. This rate is frequently 
expressed as a diffusion flux ( J), defined as the mass (or, equivalently, the number of 
atoms) M diffusing through and perpendicular to a unit cross-sectional area of solid per 
unit of time. In mathematical form, this may be represented as
 J=M
At (5.1)
where A denotes the area across which diffusion is occurring and t  is the elapsed diffusion 
time. The units for J are kilograms or atoms per meter squared per second (kg/m2∙s or 
atoms/m2∙s).
The mathematics of steady-state diffusion in a single (x ) direction is relatively simple, 
in that the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient, dC

Fick’s first law  —diffusion flux for steady-state diffusion (in one direction)5.3 FICK’S FIRST LAW
5.3 Fick’s First Law  •   125
This equation is sometimes called Fick’s first law. The constant of proportionality D 
is called the diffusion coefficient, which is expressed in square meters per second. The 
negative sign in this expression indicates that the direction of diffusion is down the con-
centration gradient, from a high to a low concentration.
Fick’s first law may be applied to the diffusion of atoms of a gas through a thin 
metal plate for which the concentrations (or pressures) of the diffusing species on both surfaces of the plate are held constant, a situation represented schematically in Figure 5.3a . 
This diffusion process eventually reaches a state wherein the diffusion flux does not change with time—that is, the mass of diffusing species entering the plate on the high-pressure side is equal to the mass exiting from the low-pressure surface—such that there is no net accumulation of diffusing species in the plate. This is an example of what is termed steady-state diffusion.
When concentration C  is plotted versus position (or distance) within the solid x , the 
resulting curve is termed the concentration profile;  furthermore, concentration gradient  
is the slope at a particular point on this curve. In the present treatment, the concentration profile is assumed to be linear, as depicted in Figure 5.3 b, and

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.1
Diffusion Flux Computation
A plate of iron is exposed to a carburizing (carbon-rich) atmosphere on one side and a decarbur-
izing (carbon-deficient) atmosphere on the other side at 700° C (1300° F). If a condition of steady 
state is achieved, calculate the diffusion flux of carbon through the plate if the concentrations of carbon at positions of 5 and 10 mm (5 × 10
−3 and 10−2 m) beneath the carburizing surface are 1.2 
and 0.8 kg/m3, respectively. Assume a diffusion coefficient of 3 × 10−11 m2/s at this temperature.

just given into this expression yields

Most practical diffusion situations are nonsteady-state ones—that is, the diffusion flux and the concentration gradient at some particular point in a solid vary with time, with a net accumulation or depletion of the diffusing species resulting. This is illustrated in Figure 5.4, which shows concentration profiles at three different diffusion times. Under conditions of nonsteady state, use of Equation 5.2 is possible but not convenient; in-stead, the partial differential equation

to occur. For diffusion reactions, several such forces are possible; but when diffusion is 
according to Equation 5.2, the concentration gradient is the driving force.2
One practical example of steady-state diffusion is found in the purification of hy-
drogen gas. One side of a thin sheet of palladium metal is exposed to the impure gas composed of hydrogen and other gaseous species such as nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The hydrogen selectively diffuses through the sheet to the opposite side, which is maintained at a constant and lower hydrogen pressure.driving force

known as Fick’s second law, is used. If the diffusion coefficient is independent of com-
position (which should be verified for each particular diffusion situation), Equation 5.4a simplifies to
 ∂C
∂t=D∂2C
∂x2 (5.4b)
Solutions to this expression (concentration in terms of both position and time) are pos-
sible when physically meaningful boundary conditions are specified. Comprehensive collections of these are given by Crank, and Carslaw and Jaeger (see References).
One practically important solution is for a semi-infinite solid
3 in which the surface 
concentration is held constant. Frequently, the source of the diffusing species is a gas phase, the partial pressure of which is maintained at a constant value. Furthermore, the following assumptions are made:
 1. Before diffusion, any of the diffusing solute atoms in the solid are uniformly 
 distributed with concentration of C
0.
 2. The value of x at the surface is zero and increases with distance into the solid.
 3. The time is taken to be zero the instant before the diffusion process begins.
These conditions are simply stated as follows:
Initial condition
For t=0, C=C0 at 0 ≤ x ≤ ∞
Boundary conditions
For t > 0, C = Cs (the constant surface concentration) at x = 0
For t > 0, C = C0 at x = ∞
Application of these conditions to Equation 5.4b yields the solution
 Cx−C0
Cs−C0=1−erf(x
2√Dt) (5.5)
where Cx represents the concentration at depth x after time t . The expression erf( x/2√Dt) 
is the Gaussian error function,4 values of which are given in mathematical tables for vari-
ous x/2√Dt values; a partial listing is given in Table 5.1. The concentration parameters 
that appear in Equation 5.5 are noted in Figure 5.5, a concentration profile taken at a 
specific time. Equation 5.5 thus demonstrates the relationship between concentration, posi-tion, and time —namely, that C
x, being a function of the dimensionless parameter x/√Dt, 
may be determined at any time and position if the parameters C0, Cs, and D  are known.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.2
Nonsteady-State Diffusion Time Computation I
For some applications, it is necessary to harden the surface of a steel (or iron–carbon alloy) 
above that of its interior. One way this may be accomplished is by increasing the surface con-centration of carbon in a process termed carburizing; the steel piece is exposed, at an elevated 
temperature, to an atmosphere rich in a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane (CH
4).
Consider one such alloy that initially has a uniform carbon concentration of 0.25 wt% and 
is to be treated at 950 °C (1750°F). If the concentration of carbon at the surface is suddenly 
brought to and maintained at 1.20 wt%, how long will it take to achieve a carbon content of carburizingTutorial Video:

0.80 wt% at a position 0.5 mm below the surface? The diffusion coefficient for carbon in iron 
at this temperature is 1.6 × 10−11 m2/s; assume that the steel piece is semi-infinite.
Solution
Because this is a nonsteady-state diffusion problem in which the surface composition is held 
constant, Equation 5.5 is used. Values for all the parameters in this expression except time t are 
specified in the problem as follows:
 C0=0.25 wt% C
 Cs=1.20 wt% C
 Cx=0.80 wt% C
 x=0.50 mm=5×10−4 m
 D=1.6×10−11 m2∕s

Nonsteady-State Diffusion Time Computation II
The diffusion coefficients for copper in aluminum at 500 °C and 600°C are 4.8 × 10−14 and 5.3 × 
10−13 m2/s, respectively. Determine the approximate time at 500 °C that will produce the same

treatment at 600°C.Tutorial Video

Solution
This is a diffusion problem in which Equation 5.6b may be employed. Because at both 500° C and 
600°C the composition remains the same at some position, say x0, Equation 5.6b may be written as

5For diffusion situations wherein time and temperature are variables and in which composition remains constant at 
some value of x, Equation 5.6b takes the form
 Dt=constant (5.7)Diffusing Species
The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient D  is indicative of the rate at which atoms dif-
fuse. The diffusing species and the host material influence the diffusion coefficient. For 
example, there is a significant difference in magnitude between self-diffusion and carbon interdiffusion in 𝛼 -iron at 500 °C, the D  value being greater for the carbon interdiffusion 
(3.0 × 10
−21 vs. 1.4 × 10−12 m2/s). This comparison also provides a contrast between rates 
of diffusion via vacancy and interstitial modes, as discussed earlier. Self-diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism, whereas carbon diffusion in iron is interstitial.
Temperature
Temperature has a profound influence on the coefficients and diffusion rates. For exam-ple, for the self-diffusion of Fe in 𝛼 -Fe, the diffusion coefficient increases approximately 
six orders of magnitude (from 3.0 × 10
−21 to 1.8 × 10−15 m2/s) in rising temperature from 
500°C to 900°C. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients is
 D=D0 exp(−Qd

where
D0 = a temperature-independent preexponential (m2/s)
Qd = the activation energy for diffusion (J/mol or eV/atom)
R = the gas constant, 8.31 J/mol ∙K or 8.62 × 10−5 eV/atom ∙K
T = absolute temperature (K)
The activation energy may be thought of as that energy required to produce 
the diffusive motion of one mole of atoms. A large activation energy results in a relatively small diffusion coefficient. Table 5.2 lists D

diffusion systems.

Solution
From Equation 5.9b the slope of the line segment in Figure 5.7 is equal to −Q
d/2.3R, and the 
intercept at 1/T = 0 gives the value of log D0. Thus, the activation energy may be determined as

We may now read the corresponding log 
D1 and log D2 values from the line seg-
ment in Figure 5.7. [Before this is done, however, a note of caution is offered: The vertical axis in Figure 5.7 is scaled logarithmi-cally (to the base 10); however, the actual diffusion coefficient values are noted on this axis. For example, for D = 10
−14 m2/s, the logarithm of D  is 
−14.0, not 10−14. Furthermore, this log-
arithmic scaling affects the readings between decade values; for example, at a location midway between 10

rather, 10−14.5 = 3.2 × 10−15.]   : VMSE

DESIGN EXAMPLE 5.1
Diffusion Temperature–Time Heat Treatment Specification
The wear resistance of a steel gear is to be improved by hardening its surface. This is to be 
accomplished by increasing the carbon content within an outer surface layer as a result of carbon diffusion into the steel; the carbon is to be supplied from an external carbon-rich gaseous atmosphere at an elevated and constant temperature. The initial carbon content of the steel is 0.20 wt%, whereas the surface concentration is to be maintained at 1.00 wt%. For this treatment to be effective, a carbon content of 0.60 wt% must be established at a position 0.75 mm below the surface. Specify an appropriate heat treatment in terms of temperature and time for tem-peratures between 900 and 1050 °C. Use data in Table 5.2 for the diffusion of carbon in 𝛾 -iron.
Solution
Because this is a nonsteady-state diffusion situation, let us first employ Equation 5.5, using the 
following values for the concentration parameters:
 C
0=0.20 wt% C
 Cs=1.00 wt% C
 Cx=0.60 wt% C
Therefore,

Using an interpolation technique as demonstrated in Example Problem 5.2 and the data presented 
in Table 5.1, we find

2√Dt=0.4747  (5.10)
The problem stipulates that x = 0.75 mm = 7.5 × 10−4 m. Therefore,
7.5×10−4 m
2√Dt=0.4747
This leads to
Dt=6.24×10−7 m2
Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient depends on temperature according to Equation 5.8, and, from Table 5.2 for the diffusion of carbon in 𝛾-iron, D
0 = 2.3 × 10−5 m2/s and Qd = 148,000 J/mol. 
Hence,

(2.3×10−5 m2/s) exp[−148,000 J/mol

and, solving for the time t, we obtain

Thus, the required diffusion time may be computed for some specified temperature (in K). The following table gives t values for four different temperatures that lie within the range stipulated in the problem.

One technology that applies solid-state diffusion is the fabrication of semiconductor 
integrated circuits (ICs) (Section 18.15). Each integrated circuit chip is a thin square wafer having dimensions on the order of 6 mm × 6 mm × 0.4 mm; furthermore, millions 
of interconnected electronic devices and circuits are embedded in one of the chip faces. Single-crystal silicon is the base material for most ICs. In order for these IC devices to function satisfactorily, very precise concentrations of an impurity (or impurities) must be incorporated into minute spatial regions in a very intricate and detailed pattern on the silicon chip; one way this is accomplished is by atomic diffusion.5.6 DIFFUSION IN SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS7
7For today’s high-density integrated circuit chips, impurities are added by ion beam implantation, which provides 
finer resolution and is a less complicated procedure than diffusion treatments.  Diffusion, however, is still used for 
low-density chips and devices such as those found in solar panels.
136  •   Chapter 5  /  Diffusion
Typically, two heat treatments are used in this process. In the first, or predeposition 
step,  impurity atoms are diffused into the silicon, often from a gas phase, the partial 
pressure of which is maintained constant. Thus, the surface composition of the impurity 
also remains constant over time, such that impurity concentration within the silicon is a function of position and time according to Equation 5.5—that is,
C
x−C0
Cs−C0=1−erf(x
2√Dt)
Predeposition treatments are normally carried out within the temperature range of 900°C and 1000 °C and for times typically less than 1 h.
The second treatment, sometimes called drive-in diffusion,  is used to transport im-
purity atoms farther into the silicon in order to provide a more suitable concentration distribution without increasing the overall impurity content. This treatment is carried out at a higher temperature than the predeposition one (up to about 1200 °C) and also 
in an oxidizing atmosphere so as to form an oxide layer on the surface. Diffusion rates through this SiO
2 layer are relatively slow, such that very few impurity atoms diffuse out 
of and escape from the silicon. Schematic concentration profiles taken at three different times for this diffusion situation are shown in Figure 5.8; these profiles may be compared and contrasted to those in Figure 5.4 for the case in which the surface concentration of diffusing species is held constant. In addition, Figure 5.9 compares (schematically) con-centration profiles for predeposition and drive-in treatments.
If we assume that the impurity atoms introduced during the predeposition treat-
ment are confined to a very thin layer at the surface of the silicon (which, of course, is only an approximation), then the solution to Fick’s second law (Equation 5.4b) for drive-in diffusion takes the form
 C(x,
 t)=Q0
√𝜋Dt exp(−x2
4Dt) (5.11)
Here, Q0 represents the total amount of impurities in the solid that were introduced during 
the predeposition treatment (in number of impurity atoms per unit area); all other parame-
ters in this equation have the same meanings as previously. Furthermore, it can be shown that
  Q0=2Cs√Dptp

where Cs is the surface concentration for the predeposition step (Figure 5.9), which was 
held constant, Dp is the diffusion coefficient, and tp is the predeposition treatment time.

Another important diffusion parameter is junction depth,  xj. It represents the 
depth (i.e., value of x ) at which the diffusing impurity concentration is just equal to 
the background concentration of that impurity in the silicon ( CB) (Figure 5.9). For 
drive-in diffusion xj may be computed using the following expression:
 xj=[(4Dd td)ln(Q0

Here, Dd and td represent, respectively, the diffusion coefficient and time for the drive-

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.6
Diffusion of Boron into Silicon
Boron atoms are to be diffused into a silicon wafer using both predeposition and drive-in heat 
treatments; the background concentration of B in this silicon material is known to be 1 × 1020 
atoms/m3. The predeposition treatment is to be conducted at 900°C for 30 min; the surface con-
centration of B is to be maintained at a constant level of 3 × 1026 atoms/m3. Drive-in diffusion 
will be carried out at 1100 °C for a period of 2 h. For the diffusion coefficient of B in Si, values 
of Qd and D0 are 3.87 eV/atom and 2.4 × 10−3 m2/s, respectively.
(a) Calculate the value of Q0.
(b) Determine the value of xj for the drive-in diffusion treatment.
(c)  Also for the drive-in treatment, compute the concentration of B atoms at a position 1 μm 
below the surface of the silicon wafer.
Solution
(a)  The value of Q0 is calculated using Equation 5.12. However, before this is possible, it is 
first necessary to determine the value of D for the predeposition treatment [Dp at T = Tp = 
900°C (1173 K)] using Equation 5.8. (Note: For the gas constant R in Equation 5.8, we use Boltzmann’s constant k, which has a value of 8.62 × 10

this is possible, it is necessary to calculate D at the temperature of the drive-in treatment 
[Dd at 1100°C (1373 K)]. Thus,

Aluminum for Integrated Circuit InterconnectsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 5 . 1
Subsequent to the predeposition and drive-in heat 
treatments just described, another important step 
in the IC fabrication process is the deposition of very thin and narrow conducting circuit paths to facilitate the passage of current from one device to another; these paths are called interconnects, and several are shown in Figure 5.10, a scanning electron micrograph of an IC chip. Of course, the material to be used for interconnects must have a high electrical conductivity—a metal, because, of all materials, metals have the highest conductivities. Table 5.3 gives values for silver, copper, gold, and aluminum, the most conduc-tive metals. On the basis of these conductivities, and discounting material cost, Ag is the metal of choice, followed by Cu, Au, and Al.
Once these interconnects have been deposited, 
it is still necessary to subject the IC chip to other heat treatments, which may run as high as 500° C. If, 
during these treatments, there is significant diffusion of the interconnect metal into the silicon, the elec-trical functionality of the IC will be destroyed. Thus, because the extent of diffusion is dependent on the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient, it is necessary to select an interconnect metal that has a small value of D in silicon. Figure 5.11 plots the logarithm of D 
versus 1/T for the diffusion, into silicon, of copper, gold, silver, and aluminum. Also, a dashed vertical line has been constructed at 500°C, from which values of

D for the four metals are noted at this temperature. 
Here it may be seen that the diffusion coefficient for aluminum in silicon (3.6 × 10
−26 m2/s) is at least eight 
orders of magnitude (i.e., a factor of 108) lower than 
the values for the other three metals.
Aluminum is indeed used for interconnects in some 
integrated circuits; even though its electrical conductiv-ity is slightly lower than the values for silver, copper, and gold, its extremely low diffusion coefficient makes it the material of choice for this application. An aluminum–copper–silicon alloy (94.5 wt% Al-4 wt% Cu-1.5 wt% Si) is sometimes also used for interconnects; it not only bonds easily to the surface of the chip, but is also more corrosion resistant than pure aluminum.More recently, copper interconnects have also 
been used. However, it is first necessary to deposit a very thin layer of tantalum or tantalum nitride be-neath the copper, which acts as a barrier to deter dif-fusion of copper into the silicon.Table 5.3   Room-Temperature Electrical Conductivity

Atomic migration may also occur along dislocations, grain boundaries, and external 
surfaces. These are sometimes called short-circuit diffusion paths inasmuch as rates are 
much faster than for bulk diffusion. However, in most situations, short-circuit contribu-tions to the overall diffusion flux are insignificant because the cross-sectional areas of these paths are extremely small.5.7 OTHER DIFFUSION PATHS
SUMMARY
• Solid-state diffusion is a means of mass transport within solid materials by stepwise 
atomic motion.
• The term interdiffusion refers to the migration of impurity atoms; for host atoms, the 
term self-diffusion is used.
• Two mechanisms for diffusion are possible: vacancy and interstitial.
Vacancy diffusion occurs via the exchange of an atom residing on a normal lattice 
site with an adjacent vacancy.
For interstitial diffusion,  an atom migrates from one interstitial position to an 
empty adjacent one.
• For a given host metal, interstitial atomic species generally diffuse more rapidly.Introduction
Diffusion 
Mechanisms
140  •   Chapter 5  /  Diffusion
• Diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient according 
to Fick’s first law, Equation 5.2.
• The diffusion condition for which the flux is independent of time is known as steady 
state.
• The driving force for steady-state diffusion is the concentration gradient (dC/dx).
• For nonsteady-state diffusion, there is a net accumulation or depletion of diffusing 
species, and the flux is dependent on time.
• The mathematics for nonsteady state in a single (x) direction (and when the diffusion 
coefficient is independent of concentration) may be described by Fick’s second law, 
Equation 5.4b.
• For a constant surface composition boundary condition, the solution to Fick’s sec-
ond law (Equation 5.4b) is Equation 5.5, which involves the Gaussian error func-tion (erf).
• The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is indicative of the rate of atomic motion 
and depends on both host and diffusing species as well as on temperature.
• The diffusion coefficient is a function of temperature according to Equation 5.8.
• The two heat treatments that are used to diffuse impurities into silicon during inte-
grated circuit fabrication are predeposition and drive-in.
During predeposition, impurity atoms are diffused into the silicon, often from a 
gas phase, the partial pressure of which is maintained constant.
For the drive-in step, impurity atoms are transported deeper into the silicon so 
as to provide a more suitable concentration distribution without increasing the 
overall impurity content.
• Integrated circuit interconnects are normally made of aluminum—instead of metals 
such as copper, silver, and gold that have higher electrical conductivities—on the basis of diffusion considerations. During high-temperature heat treatments, interconnect metal atoms diffuse into the silicon; appreciable concentrations will compromise the chip’s functionality.Fick’s First Law

It is incumbent on engineers to understand how the vari-
ous mechanical properties are measured and what these properties represent; they may be called upon to design structures/components using predetermined  materials such that unacceptable levels of deformation and/or failure will not occur. In Design Examples 6.1 and 6.2 we pre-sent two typical types of design protocols; these examples demonstrate, respectively, a procedure used to design a tensile-testing apparatus and how material requirements may be determined for a pressurized cylindrical tube.

Many materials are subjected to forces or loads when in service; examples include the 
aluminum alloy from which an airplane wing is constructed and the steel in an automo-bile axle. In such situations it is necessary to know the characteristics of the material and to design the member from which it is made such that any resulting deformation will not be excessive and fracture will not occur. The mechanical behavior of a ma-terial reflects its response or deformation in relation to an applied load or force. Key 
mechanical design properties are stiffness, strength, hardness, ductility, and toughness.
The mechanical properties of materials are ascertained by performing carefully de-
signed laboratory experiments that replicate as nearly as possible the service conditions. Factors to be considered include the nature of the applied load and its duration, as well as the environmental conditions. It is possible for the load to be tensile, compressive, or shear, and its magnitude may be constant with time, or it may fluctuate continuously. Application time may be only a fraction of a second, or it may extend over a period of many years. Service temperature may be an important factor.
Mechanical properties are of concern to a variety of parties (e.g., producers and 
consumers of materials, research organizations, government agencies) that have dif-fering interests. Consequently, it is imperative that there be some consistency in the manner in which tests are conducted and in the interpretation of their results. This consistency is accomplished by using standardized testing techniques. Establishment 6.1 INTRODUCTION

and publication of these standards are often coordinated by professional societies. In 
the United States the most active organization is the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Its Annual Book of ASTM Standards  (http://www.astm.org) com-
prises numerous volumes that are issued and updated yearly; a large number of these standards relate to mechanical testing techniques. Several of these are referenced by footnote in this and subsequent chapters.
The role of structural engineers is to determine stresses and stress distributions 
within members that are subjected to well-defined loads. This may be accomplished by experimental testing techniques and/or by theoretical and mathematical stress analyses. These topics are treated in traditional texts on stress analysis and strength of materials.
Materials and metallurgical engineers, however, are concerned with producing and 
fabricating materials to meet service requirements as predicted by these stress analyses. This necessarily involves an understanding of the relationships between the microstruc-ture (i.e., internal features) of materials and their mechanical properties.
Materials are frequently chosen for structural applications because they have 
desirable combinations of mechanical characteristics. The present discussion is confined primarily to the mechanical behavior of metals; polymers and ceramics are treated separately because they are, to a large degree, mechanically different from metals. This chapter discusses the stress–strain behavior of metals and the related mechanical properties and also examines other important mechanical char-acteristics. Discussions of the microscopic aspects of deformation mechanisms and methods to strengthen and regulate the mechanical behavior of metals are deferred to later chapters.
If a load is static or changes relatively slowly with time and is applied uniformly over a cross section or surface of a member, the mechanical behavior may be ascertained by a simple stress–strain test; these are most commonly conducted for metals at room temperature. There are three principal ways in which a load may be applied: namely, tension, compression, and shear (Figures 6.1a , b, c). In engineering practice 
many loads are torsional rather than pure shear; this type of loading is illustrated in Figure 6.1d .
Tension Tests1
One of the most common mechanical stress–strain tests is performed in tension. As will be seen, the tension test can be used to ascertain several mechanical properties of materials that are important in design. A specimen is deformed, usually to frac-ture, with a gradually increasing tensile load that is applied uniaxially along the long axis of a specimen. A standard tensile specimen is shown in Figure 6.2. Normally, the cross section is circular, but rectangular specimens are also used. This “dogbone” specimen configuration was chosen so that, during testing, deformation is confined to the narrow center region (which has a uniform cross section along its length) and also to reduce the likelihood of fracture at the ends of the specimen. The standard diameter is approximately 12.8 mm (0.5 in.), whereas the reduced section length should be at least four times this diameter; 60 mm (2
1
4 in.) is common. Gauge length 
is used in ductility computations, as discussed in Section 6.6; the standard value is 50 mm (2.0 in.). The specimen is mounted by its ends into the holding grips of the 6.2 CONCEPTS OF STRESS AND STRAIN

testing apparatus (Figure 6.3). The tensile testing machine is designed to elongate 
the specimen at a constant rate, and to continuously and simultaneously measure the instantaneous applied load (with a load cell) and the resulting elongations (using an extensometer). A stress–strain test typically takes several minutes to perform and is destructive; that is, the test specimen is permanently deformed and usually fractured. [Photograph (a ) opening this chapter is of a modern tensile-testing apparatus.]
146  •   Chapter 6  /  Mechanical Properties of Metals
The output of such a tensile test is recorded (usually on a computer) as load or 
force versus elongation. These load–deformation characteristics depend on the speci-
men size. For example, it requires twice the load to produce the same elongation if the cross-sectional area of the specimen is doubled. To minimize these geometrical factors, load and elongation are normalized to the respective parameters of engineering stress 
and engineering strain. Engineering stress 𝜎 is defined by the relationship
 
𝜎=F
A0 (6.1)
in which F is the instantaneous load applied perpendicular to the specimen cross sec-tion, in units of newtons (N) or pounds force (lb
f), and A0 is the original cross-sectional 
area before any load is applied (m2 or in.2). The units of engineering stress (referred to 
subsequently as just stress) are megapascals, MPa (SI) (where 1 MPa = 106 N/m2), and 
pounds force per square inch, psi (customary U.S.).2
Engineering strain 𝜀 is defined according to
 𝜀=li−l0
l0=Δl
l0 (6.2)
in which l0 is the original length before any load is applied and li is the instantaneous 
length. Sometimes the quantity li − l0 is denoted as Δl and is the deformation elongation 
or change in length at some instant, as referenced to the original length. Engineering strain (subsequently called just strain) is unitless, but meters per meter or inches per inch 
is often used; the value of strain is obviously independent of the unit system. Sometimes strain is also expressed as a percentage, in which the strain value is multiplied by 100.engineering stress

What Are the 
Differences Between 
Stress and Strain?
6.2 Concepts of Stress and Strain   •  147
Compression Tests3
Compression stress–strain tests may be conducted if in-service forces are of this 
type. A compression test is conducted in a manner similar to the tensile test, except that the force is compressive and the specimen contracts along the direction of the stress. Equations 6.1 and 6.2 are utilized to compute compressive stress and strain, respectively. By convention, a compressive force is taken to be negative, which yields a negative stress. Furthermore, because l
0 is greater than li, compressive strains com-
puted from Equation 6.2 are necessarily also negative. Tensile tests are more com-mon because they are easier to perform; also, for most materials used in structural applications, very little additional information is obtained from compressive tests. Compressive tests are used when a material’s behavior under large and permanent (i.e., plastic) strains is desired, as in manufacturing applications, or when the material is brittle in tension.
Shear and Torsional Tests4
For tests performed using a pure shear force as shown in Figure 6.1 c, the shear stress 𝜏 
is computed according to
 𝜏=F
A0 (6.3)
where F is the load or force imposed parallel to the upper and lower faces, each of which 
has an area of A0. The shear strain 𝛾 is defined as the tangent of the strain angle 𝜃, as 
indicated in the figure. The units for shear stress and strain are the same as for their 
tensile counterparts.
Torsion is a variation of pure shear in which a structural member is twisted in the 
manner of Figure 6.1d ; torsional forces produce a rotational motion about the longitu-
dinal axis of one end of the member relative to the other end. Examples of torsion are found for machine axles and drive shafts as well as for twist drills. Torsional tests are normally performed on cylindrical solid shafts or tubes. A shear stress 𝜏 is a function 
of the applied torque T , whereas shear strain 𝛾  is related to the angle of twist, 𝜙  in 
Figure 6.1d .
Geometric Considerations of the Stress State
Stresses that are computed from the tensile, compressive, shear, and torsional force states represented in Figure 6.1 act either parallel or perpendicular to planar faces of the bodies represented in these illustrations. Note that the stress state is a func-tion of the orientations of the planes upon which the stresses are taken to act. For example, consider the cylindrical tensile specimen of Figure 6.4 that is subjected to a tensile stress 𝜎  applied parallel to its axis. Furthermore, consider also the plane 
p-pʹ that is oriented at some arbitrary angle 𝜃  relative to the plane of the specimen 
end-face. Upon this plane p -pʹ, the applied stress is no longer a pure tensile one. 
Rather, a more complex stress state is present that consists of a tensile (or normal) stress 𝜎′ that acts normal to the p -pʹ plane and, in addition, a shear stress 𝜏′ that 
acts parallel to this plane; both of these stresses are represented in the figure. Using Definition of shear

These same mechanics principles allow the transformation of stress components from 
one coordinate system to another coordinate system with a different orientation. Such treatments are beyond the scope of the present discussion.
Elastic Deformation
The degree to which a structure deforms or strains depends on the magnitude of an imposed stress. For most metals that are stressed in tension and at relatively low levels, stress and strain are proportional to each other through the relationship
 
𝜎=E𝜀 (6.5)
This is known as Hooke’s law, and the constant of proportionality E  (GPa or psi)6 is 
the modulus of elasticity,  or Young’s modulus. For most typical metals, the magnitude 
of this modulus ranges between 45 GPa (6.5 ×  106 psi), for magnesium, and 407 GPa 
(59 × 106 psi), for tungsten. Modulus of elasticity values for several metals at room 
temperature are presented in Table 6.1.
Deformation in which stress and strain are proportional is called elastic deformation;  a 
plot of stress (ordinate) versus strain (abscissa) results in a linear relationship, as shown in 
Figure 6.5. The slope of this linear segment corresponds to the modulus of elasticity E . This 
modulus may be thought of as stiffness, or a material’s resistance to elastic deformation. The greater the modulus, the stiffer the material, or the smaller the elastic strain that results Hooke’s law—

from the application of a given stress. The modulus is an important design parameter for 
computing elastic deflections.
Elastic deformation is nonpermanent, which means that when the applied load is 
released, the piece returns to its original shape. As shown in the stress–strain plot (Figure 6.5), application of the load corresponds to moving from the origin up and along the straight line. Upon release of the load, the line is traversed in the opposite direction, back to the origin.
There are some materials (i.e., gray cast iron, concrete, and many polymers) for 
which this elastic portion of the stress–strain curve is not linear (Figure 6.6); hence, it is not possible to determine a modulus of elasticity as described previously. For this nonlinear behavior, either the tangent or secant modulus is normally used. The tan-gent modulus is taken as the slope of the stress–strain curve at some specified level of stress, whereas the secant modulus represents the slope of a secant drawn from the origin to some given point of the 𝜎 -𝜀 curve. The determination of these moduli is il-
lustrated in Figure 6.6.
On an atomic scale, macroscopic elastic strain is manifested as small changes in 
the interatomic spacing and the stretching of interatomic bonds. As a consequence, the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity is a measure of the resistance to separation of adjacent atoms, that is, the interatomic bonding forces. Furthermore, this modulus is proportional to the slope of the interatomic force–separation curve (Figure 2.10 a) at 
the equilibrium spacing:
 E∝(dF
dr)r0 (6.6)
Figure 6.7 shows the force–separation curves for materials having both strong and weak 
interatomic bonds; the slope at r0 is indicated for each.
Values of the modulus of elasticity for ceramic materials are about the same as 
for metals; for polymers they are lower (Figure 1.5). These differences are a direct Figure 6.5  Schematic

Furthermore, with increasing temperature, the modulus of elasticity decreases, as is shown for several metals in Figure 6.8.
As would be expected, the imposition of compressive, shear, or torsional stresses 
also evokes elastic behavior. The stress–strain characteristics at low stress levels are vir-tually the same for both tensile and compressive situations, to include the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity. Shear stress and strain are proportional to each other through the expression

where G is the shear modulus, the slope of the linear elastic region of the shear 
stress–strain curve. Table 6.1 also gives the shear moduli for a number of common

To this point, it has been assumed that elastic deformation is time independent—that 
is, that an applied stress produces an instantaneous elastic strain that remains constant over the period of time the stress is maintained. It has also been assumed that upon release of the load, the strain is totally recovered—that is, that the strain immediately returns to zero. In most engineering materials, however, there will also exist a time-dependent elastic strain component—that is, elastic deformation will continue after the stress application, and upon load release, some finite time is required for com-plete recovery. This time-dependent elastic behavior is known as anelasticity,  and it 
is due to time-dependent microscopic and atomistic processes that are attendant to the deformation. For metals, the anelastic component is normally small and is often neglected. However, for some polymeric materials, its magnitude is significant; in this case it is termed viscoelastic behavior, which is the discussion topic of Section 15.4.

Elongation (Elastic) Computation
A piece of copper originally 305 mm (12 in.) long is pulled in tension with a stress of 276 MPa (40,000 psi). If the deformation is entirely elastic, what will be the resultant elongation?
Solution
Because the deformation is elastic, strain is dependent on stress according to Equation 6.5. 
Furthermore, the elongation Δl is related to the original length l
0 through Equation 6.2. 
Combining these two expressions and solving for Δl yields
 𝜎=𝜀E=(Δl
l0)E
 Δl=𝜎l0
E
The values of 𝜎 and l0 are given as 276 MPa and 305 mm, respectively, and the magnitude of E 
for copper from Table 6.1 is 110 GPa (16 × 106 psi). Elongation is obtained by substitution into 
the preceding expression as
Δl=(276 MPa)(305 mm)
110×103 MPa=0.77 mm (0.03 in.)
When a tensile stress is imposed on a metal specimen, an elastic elongation and ac-
companying strain 𝜀z result in the direction of the applied stress (arbitrarily taken to 
be the z  direction), as indicated in Figure 6.9. As a result of this elongation, there will 
be constrictions in the lateral (x  and y ) directions perpendicular to the applied stress; 
from these contractions, the compressive strains 𝜀x and 𝜀y may be determined. If the 
applied stress is uniaxial (only in the z  direction) and the material is isotropic, then 
𝜀x = 𝜀y. A parameter termed Poisson’s ratio 𝜈 is defined as the ratio of the lateral and 
axial strains, or
 𝜈=−𝜀x
𝜀z=−𝜀y

For virtually all structural materials, 𝜀x and 𝜀z will be of opposite sign; therefore, the 
negative sign is included in the preceding expression to ensure that 𝜈 is positive.7 
Theoretically, Poisson’s ratio for isotropic materials should be 1
4; furthermore, the maxi-
mum value for 𝜈 (or the value for which there is no net volume change) is 0.50. For many 
metals and other alloys, values of Poisson’s ratio range between 0.25 and 0.35. Table 6.1 
shows 𝜈 values for several common metallic materials.
For isotropic materials, shear and elastic moduli are related to each other and to 
Poisson’s ratio according to
 E=2G(1 + 𝜈)  (6.9)
In most metals, G is about 0.4E; thus, if the value of one modulus is known, the other 
may be approximated.
Many materials are elastically anisotropic; that is, the elastic behavior (i.e., the 
magnitude of E ) varies with crystallographic direction (see Table 3.4). For these ma-
terials, the elastic properties are completely characterized only by the specification of several elastic constants, their number depending on characteristics of the crystal structure. Even for isotropic materials, for complete characterization of the elastic properties, at least two constants must be given. Because the grain orientation is random in most polycrystalline materials, these may be considered to be isotropic; inorganic ceramic glasses are also isotropic. The remaining discussion of mechanical behavior assumes isotropy and polycrystallinity because this is the character of most engineering materials.Relationship among 
elastic parameters  —modulus of elasticity, shear modulus, and Poisson’s ratio
7Some materials (e.g., specially prepared polymer foams) when pulled in tension actually expand in the transverse 
direction. In these materials, both 𝜀x and 𝜀z of Equation 6.8 are positive, and thus Poisson’s ratio is negative. Materials 
that exhibit this effect are termed auxetics.

Computation of Load to Produce Specified Diameter Change
A tensile stress is to be applied 
along the long axis of a cylindri-cal brass rod that has a diameter of 10 mm (0.4 in.). Determine the magnitude of the load re-quired to produce a 2.5 × 10

mm (10−4-in.) change in diame-
ter if the deformation is entirely elastic.
Solution
This deformation situation is 
represented in the accompany-ing drawing. When the force F  is applied, 
the specimen will elongate in the z direction and at the same time 
experience a reduction in diam-eter, Δd, of 2.5 ×  10

x direction. For the strain in the x  direction,
𝜀x=Δd
d0=−2.5×10−3 mm
10 mm=−2.5×10−4
which is negative because the diameter is reduced. It next becomes necessary to calculate the strain in the z direction using Equation 6.8. The 
value for Poisson’s ratio for brass is 0.34 (Table 6.1), and thus
𝜀
z=−𝜀x
v=−(−2.5×10−4)

Plastic Deformation
For most metallic materials, elastic deformation persists only to strains of about 0.005. 
As the material is deformed beyond this point, the stress is no longer proportional to strain (Hooke’s law, Equation 6.5, ceases to be valid), and permanent, nonrecoverable, or plastic deformation occurs. Figure 6.10a plots schematically the tensile stress–strain 
behavior into the plastic region for a typical metal. The transition from elastic to plastic is a gradual one for most metals; some curvature results at the onset of plastic deforma-tion, which increases more rapidly with rising stress.
From an atomic perspective, plastic deformation corresponds to the breaking 
of bonds with original atom neighbors and then the re-forming of bonds with new neighbors as large numbers of atoms or molecules move relative to one another; upon removal of the stress, they do not return to their original positions. The mechanism of this deformation is different for crystalline and amorphous materials. For crystalline solids, deformation is accomplished by means of a process called slip, which involves 
the motion of dislocations as discussed in Section 7.2. Plastic deformation in noncrystal-line solids (as well as liquids) occurs by a viscous flow mechanism, which is outlined in Section 12.10.plastic deformation
Yielding and Yield Strength
Most structures are designed to ensure that only elastic deformation will result when a stress is applied. A structure or component that has plastically deformed—or expe-rienced a permanent change in shape—may not be capable of functioning as intended. It is therefore desirable to know the stress level at which plastic deformation begins, or where the phenomenon of yielding occurs. For metals that experience this gradual

elastic–plastic transition, the point of yielding may be determined as the initial 
departure from linearity of the stress–strain curve; this is sometimes called the 
proportional limit,  as indicated by point P  in Figure 6.10a , and represents the onset 
of plastic deformation on a microscopic level. The position of this point P  is difficult 
to measure precisely. As a consequence, a convention has been established by which 
a straight line is constructed parallel to the elastic portion of the stress–strain curve at some specified strain offset, usually 0.002. The stress corresponding to the inter-section of this line and the stress–strain curve as it bends over in the plastic region is defined as the yield strength 𝜎
y.8 This is demonstrated in Figure 6.10a . The units of 
yield strength are MPa or psi.9
For materials having a nonlinear elastic region (Figure 6.6), use of the strain offset 
method is not possible, and the usual practice is to define the yield strength as the stress required to produce some amount of strain (e.g., 𝜀 = 0.005).
Some steels and other materials exhibit the tensile stress–strain behavior shown 
in Figure 6.10b . The elastic–plastic transition is very well defined and occurs abruptly 
in what is termed a yield point phenomenon. At the upper yield point, plastic deformation is initiated with an apparent decrease in engineering stress. Continued deformation fluctuates slightly about some constant stress value, termed the lower yield point; stress subsequently rises with increasing strain. For metals that display this effect, the yield strength is taken as the average stress that is associated with the lower yield point because it is well defined and relatively insensitive to the testing procedure.
10 Thus, it is not necessary to employ the strain offset method for these 
materials.
The magnitude of the yield strength for a metal is a measure of its resistance to plas-
tic deformation. Yield strengths may range from 35 MPa (5000 psi) for a low-strength aluminum to greater than 1400 MPa (200,000 psi) for high-strength steels.proportional limit
yield strength
8Strength is used in lieu of stress because strength is a property of the metal, whereas stress is r elated to the magnitude 
of the applied load.
9For customary U.S. units, the unit of kilopounds per square inch (ksi) is sometimes used for the sake of convenience, where 
1 ksi = 1000 psi.
10Note that to observe the yield point phenomenon, a “stiff” tensile-testing apparatus must be used; by “stiff,” it is 
meant that there is very little elastic deformation of the machine during loading.Tensile Strength
After yielding, the stress necessary to continue plastic deformation in metals increases 
to a maximum, point M in Figure 6.11, and then decreases to the eventual fracture, point F. The tensile strength TS (MPa or psi) is the stress at the maximum on the engineering 
stress–strain curve (Figure 6.11). This corresponds to the maximum stress that can be sustained by a structure in tension; if this stress is applied and maintained, fracture will result. All deformation to this point is uniform throughout the narrow region of the ten-sile specimen. However, at this maximum stress, a small constriction or neck begins to form at some point, and all subsequent deformation is confined at this neck, as indicated by the schematic specimen insets in Figure 6.11. This phenomenon is termed necking, tensile strengthConcept Check 6.1 Cite the primary differences between elastic, anelastic, and plastic

11The apparent decrease in engineering stress with continued deformation past the maximum point of Figure 6.11 is 
due to the necking phenomenon. As explained in Section 6.7 , the true stress (within the neck) actually increases.Figure 6.11  Typical

and fracture ultimately occurs at the neck.11 The fracture strength corresponds to the 
stress at fracture.
Tensile strengths vary from 50 MPa (7000 psi) for an aluminum to as high as 3000 
MPa (450,000 psi) for the high-strength steels. Typically, when the strength of a metal 
is cited for design purposes, the yield strength is used because by the time a stress cor-responding to the tensile strength has been applied, often a structure has experienced so much plastic deformation that it is useless. Furthermore, fracture strengths are not normally specified for engineering design purposes.

stress divided by the corresponding change in strain; in mathematical terms,
 E=slope =Δ𝜎
Δ𝜀=𝜎2−𝜎1
𝜀2−𝜀1 (6.10)
Inasmuch as the line segment passes through the origin, it is convenient to take both 𝜎1 and 
𝜀1 as zero. If 𝜎2 is arbitrarily taken as 150 MPa, then 𝜀2 will have a value of 0.0016. Therefore,
E=(150 −0) MPa

Δl=𝜀l0=(0.06)(250 mm) =15 mm (0.6 in.)
158  •   Chapter 6  /  Mechanical Properties of Metals
Ductility
Ductility is another important mechanical property. It is a measure of the degree 
of plastic deformation that has been sustained at fracture. A metal that experiences very little or no plastic deformation upon fracture is termed brittle. The tensile stress–strain behaviors for both ductile and brittle metals are schematically illustrated in Figure 6.13.
Ductility may be expressed quantitatively as either percent elongation or percent 
reduction in area. Percent elongation (%EL) is the percentage of plastic strain at frac-ture, or
%EL =(lf−l0
l0)×100  (6.11)
where lf is the fracture length12 and l0 is the original gauge length as given earlier. 
Inasmuch as a significant proportion of the plastic deformation at fracture is confined to the neck region, the magnitude of %EL will depend on specimen gauge length. The shorter l
0, the greater the fraction of total elongation from the neck and, consequently, 
the higher the value of %EL. Therefore, l0 should be specified when percent elongation 
values are cited; it is commonly 50 mm (2 in.).
Percent reduction in area (%RA) is defined as
%RA =(A0−Af
A0)×100  (6.12)
where A0 is the original cross-sectional area and Af is the cross-sectional area at the 
point of fracture.12 Values of percent reduction in area are independent of both l0
and A0. Furthermore, for a given material, the magnitudes of %EL and %RA will, 
in general, be different. Most metals possess at least a moderate degree of ductility at room temperature; however, some become brittle as the temperature is lowered (Section 8.6).
Knowledge of the ductility of materials is important for at least two reasons. First, 
it indicates to a designer the degree to which a structure will deform plastically before ductility

fracture. Second, it specifies the degree of allowable deformation during fabrication 
operations. We sometimes refer to relatively ductile materials as being “forgiving,” in the sense that they may experience local deformation without fracture, should there be an error in the magnitude of the design stress calculation.
Brittle materials are approximately considered to be those having a fracture strain 
of less than about 5%.
Thus, several important mechanical properties of metals may be determined 
from tensile stress–strain tests. Table 6.2 presents some typical room-temperature values of yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility for several common metals. These properties are sensitive to any prior deformation, the presence of impurities, and/or any heat treatment to which the metal has been subjected. The modulus of elasticity is one mechanical parameter that is insensitive to these treatments. As with modulus of elasticity, the magnitudes of both yield and tensile strengths decline with increasing temperature; just the reverse holds for ductility—it usually increases with temperature. Figure 6.14 shows how the stress–strain behavior of iron varies with temperature.
Resilience
Resilience is the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then, upon unloading, to have this energy recovered. The associated property is the modulus of resilience, U
r, which is the strain energy per unit volume required to stress a 
material from an unloaded state up to the point of yielding.
Computationally, the modulus of resilience for a specimen subjected to a uniaxial 
tension test is just the area under the engineering stress–strain curve taken to yielding (Figure 6.15), or

The units of resilience are the product of the units from each of the two axes of the 
stress–strain plot. For SI units, this is joules per cubic meter (J/m3, equivalent to Pa), 
whereas with customary U.S. units, it is inch-pounds force per cubic inch (in.-lbf/in.3, 
equivalent to psi). Both joules and inch-pounds force are units of energy, and thus this 
area under the stress–strain curve represents energy absorption per unit volume (in cubic meters or cubic inches) of material.

Thus, resilient materials are those having high yield strengths and low moduli of elasticity; such alloys are used in spring applications.
Toughness
Toughness is a mechanical term that may be used in several contexts. For one, toughness (or more specifically, fracture toughness) is a property that is indicative of a material’s resistance to fracture when a crack (or other stress-concentrating defect) is present (as discussed in Section 8.5). Because it is nearly impossible (as well as costly) to manufac-ture materials with zero defects (or to prevent damage during service), fracture tough-ness is a major consideration for all structural materials.
Another way of defining toughness is as the ability of a material to absorb energy and 
plastically deform before fracturing. For dynamic (high strain rate) loading conditions and when a notch (or point of stress concentration) is present, notch toughness is assessed by using an impact test, as discussed in Section 8.6.Modulus of

6.7 True Stress and Strain  •   161
For the static (low strain rate) situation, a measure of toughness in metals 
(derived from plastic deformation) may be ascertained from the results of a tensile 
stress–strain test. It is the area under the 𝜎 –𝜀 curve up to the point of fracture. The 
units are the same as for resilience (i.e., energy per unit volume of material). For a metal to be tough, it must display both strength and ductility. This is demonstrated in Figure 6.13, in which the stress–strain curves are plotted for both metal types. Hence, even though the brittle metal has higher yield and tensile strengths, it has a lower toughness than the ductile one, as can be seen by comparing the areas ABC  
and ABʹCʹ in Figure 6.13.

From Figure 6.11, the decline in the stress necessary to continue deformation past the 
maximum—point M—seems to indicate that the metal is becoming weaker. This is 
not at all the case; as a matter of fact, it is increasing in strength. However, the cross-sectional area is decreasing rapidly within the neck region, where deformation is oc-curring. This results in a reduction in the load-bearing capacity of the specimen. The stress, as computed from Equation 6.1, is on the basis of the original cross-sectional area before any deformation and does not take into account this reduction in area at the neck.
Sometimes it is more meaningful to use a true stress–true strain scheme. True stress

A schematic comparison of engineering and true stress–strain behaviors is made in 
Figure 6.16. It is worth noting that the true stress necessary to sustain increasing strain continues to rise past the tensile point Mʹ.
Coincident with the formation of a neck is the introduction of a complex stress state 
within the neck region (i.e., the existence of other stress components in addition to the axial stress). As a consequence, the correct stress ( axial) within the neck is slightly lower 
than the stress computed from the applied load and neck cross-sectional area. This leads to the “corrected” curve in Figure 6.16.
For some metals and alloys the region of the true stress–strain curve from the 
onset of plastic deformation to the point at which necking begins may be approxi-mated by

exponent and has a value less than unity. Values of n  and K  for several alloys are

Ductility and True-Stress-at-Fracture Computations
A cylindrical specimen of steel having an original diameter of 12.8 mm (0.505 in.) is tensile-
tested to fracture and found to have an engineering fracture strength 𝜎f of 460 MPa (67,000 psi). 
If its cross-sectional diameter at fracture is 10.7 mm (0.422 in.), determine

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 6.5
Calculation of Strain-Hardening Exponent
Compute the strain-hardening exponent n  in Equation 6.19 for an alloy in which a true stress of 
415 MPa (60,000 psi) produces a true strain of 0.10; assume a value of 1035 MPa (150,000 psi) for K .
Solution
This requires some algebraic manipulation of Equation 6.19 so that n becomes the dependent 
parameter. We first take the logarithm of both sides of Equation 6.19 as follows:
log 𝜎T=log(K𝜀n
T)=log K+log( 𝜀n
T)
Which leads to
log 𝜎T=log K+n log 𝜀T
Rearrangement of this expression yields
n log 𝜀T=log 𝜎T−log K
And when solving for n, the following results:
n=log 𝜎T−log K
log 𝜀T
We now solve for the value of n by insertion of 𝜎T (415 MPa), K (1035 MPa) and 𝜀T (0.10) 
provided in the problem statement as follows:
n=log(415 MPa) −log(1035 MPa)
log(0.1)=0.40
Upon release of the load during the course of a stress–strain test, some fraction of the total 
deformation is recovered as elastic strain. This behavior is demonstrated in Figure 6.17, a schematic engineering stress–strain plot. During the unloading cycle, the curve traces a near straight-line path from the point of unloading (point D ), and its slope is virtually 6.8  ELASTIC RECOVERY AFTER

Of course, metals may experience plastic deformation under the influence of applied 
compressive, shear, and torsional loads. The resulting stress–strain behavior into the plastic region is similar to the tensile counterpart (Figure 6.10a : yielding and the asso-
ciated curvature). However, for compression, there is no maximum because necking does not occur; furthermore, the mode of fracture is different from that for tension.6.9  COMPRESSIVE, SHEAR, AND TORSIONAL 
DEFORMATIONS
Another mechanical property that may be important to consider is hardness,  which is a 
measure of a material’s resistance to localized plastic deformation (e.g., a small dent or 
a scratch). Early hardness tests were based on natural minerals with a scale constructed solely on the ability of one material to scratch another that was softer. A qualitative and somewhat arbitrary hardness indexing scheme was devised, termed the Mohs scale , which 
ranged from 1 on the soft end for talc to 10 for diamond. Quantitative hardness tech-niques have been developed over the years in which a small indenter is forced into the surface of a material to be tested under controlled conditions of load and rate of applica-tion. The depth or size of the resulting indentation is measured and related to a hardness number; the softer the material, the larger and deeper the indentation, and the lower the hardness index number. Measured hardnesses are only relative (rather than absolute), and care should be exercised when comparing values determined by different techniques.
Hardness tests are performed more frequently than any other mechanical test for 
several reasons:
 1. They are simple and inexpensive—typically, no special specimen need be 
prepared, and the testing apparatus is relatively inexpensive.
 2. The test is nondestructive—the specimen is neither fractured nor excessively 
deformed; a small indentation is the only deformation.
 3. Other mechanical properties often may be estimated from hardness data, such as 
tensile strength (see Figure 6.19).
Rockwell Hardness Tests13
The Rockwell tests constitute the most common method used to measure hardness 
because they are so simple to perform and require no special skills. Several different hardness6.10 HARDNESS

The magnitude of this elastic strain, which is regained during unloading, corresponds to the strain recovery, as shown in Figure 6.17. If the load is reapplied, the curve will traverse essentially the same linear portion in the direction opposite to unloading; yielding will again occur at the unloading stress level where the unloading began. There will also be an elastic strain recovery associated with fracture.

scales may be used from possible combinations of various indenters and different loads, a 
process that permits the testing of virtually all metal alloys (as well as some polymers). Indenters include spherical and hardened steel balls having diameters of

2 in. 
(1.588, 3.175, 6.350, and 12.70 mm, respectively), as well as a conical diamond (Brale) indenter, which is used for the hardest materials.
With this system, a hardness number is determined by the difference in depth of 
penetration resulting from the application of an initial minor load followed by a larger major load; utilization of a minor load enhances test accuracy. On the basis of the mag-nitude of both major and minor loads, there are two types of tests: Rockwell and su-perficial Rockwell. For the Rockwell test, the minor load is 10 kg, whereas major loads are 60, 100, and 150 kg. Each scale is represented by a letter of the alphabet; several are listed with the corresponding indenter and load in Tables 6.5 and 6.6a. For superficial tests, 3 kg is the minor load; 15, 30, and 45 kg are the possible major load values. These scales are identified by a 15, 30, or 45 (according to load), followed by N, T, W, X, or Y, depending on the indenter. Superficial tests are frequently performed on thin speci-mens. Table 6.6b presents several superficial scales.
When specifying Rockwell and superficial hardnesses, both hardness number and 
scale symbol must be indicated. The scale is designated by the symbol HR followed by the appropriate scale identification.
14 For example, 80 HRB represents a Rockwell 
hardness of 80 on the B scale, and 60 HR30W indicates a superficial hardness of 60 on the 30W scale.
For each scale, hardnesses may range up to 130; however, as hardness values rise 
above 100 or drop below 20 on any scale, they become inaccurate; because the scales have some overlap, in such a situation it is best to utilize the next-harder or next-softer scale.
Inaccuracies also result if the test specimen is too thin, if an indentation is made 
too near a specimen edge, or if two indentations are made too close to one another. Specimen thickness should be at least 10 times the indentation depth, whereas al-lowance should be made for at least three indentation diameters between the center of one indentation and the specimen edge, or to the center of a second indentation. Furthermore, testing of specimens stacked one on top of another is not recommended. Also, accuracy is dependent on the indentation being made into a smooth flat surface.
The modern apparatus for making Rockwell hardness measurements is automated 
and very simple to use; hardness is read directly, and each measurement requires only a few seconds. This apparatus also permits a variation in the time of load application. This variable must also be considered in interpreting hardness data.
Brinell Hardness Tests15
In Brinell tests, as in Rockwell measurements, a hard, spherical indenter is forced into the surface of the metal to be tested. The diameter of the hardened steel (or tungsten carbide) indenter is 10.00 mm (0.394 in.). Standard loads range between 500 and 3000 kg in 500-kg increments; during a test, the load is maintained constant for a specified time (between 10 and 30 s). Harder materials require greater applied loads. The Brinell hard-ness number, HB, is a function of both the magnitude of the load and the diameter of the resulting indentation (see Table 6.5).
16 This diameter is measured with a special low-
power microscope using a scale that is etched on the eyepiece. The measured diameter is then converted to the appropriate HB number using a chart; only one scale is employed with this technique.
14Rockwell scales are also frequently designated by an R with the appropriate scale letter as a subscript, for example, 
RC denotes the Rockwell C scale.

16The Brinell hardness number is also represented by BHN.

Semiautomatic techniques for measuring Brinell hardness are available. These 
employ optical scanning systems consisting of a digital camera mounted on a flex-
ible probe, which allows positioning of the camera over the indentation. Data from the camera are transferred to a computer that analyzes the indentation, determines its size, and then calculates the Brinell hardness number. For this technique, surface finish requirements are normally more stringent than those for manual measurements.
Maximum specimen thickness and indentation position (relative to specimen edges) 
as well as minimum indentation spacing requirements are the same as for Rockwell tests. In addition, a well-defined indentation is required; this necessitates a smooth, flat surface in which the indentation is made.
Knoop and Vickers Microindentation Hardness Tests17
Two other hardness-testing techniques are the Knoop (pronounced nup) and Vickers 
tests (sometimes also called diamond pyramid). For each test, a very small diamond indenter having pyramidal geometry is forced into the surface of the specimen. Applied loads are much smaller than for the Rockwell and Brinell tests, ranging between 1 and 1000 g. The resulting impression is observed under a microscope and measured; this measurement is then converted into a hardness number (Table 6.5). Careful specimen surface preparation (grinding and polishing) may be necessary to ensure a well-defined indentation that may be measured accurately. The Knoop and Vickers hardness numbers are designated by HK and HV, respectively,
18 and 
hardness scales for both techniques are approximately equivalent. The Knoop and Vickers techniques are referred to as microindentation-testing methods on the basis of indenter size. Both are well suited for measuring the hardness of small, selected specimen regions; furthermore, the Knoop technique is used for testing brittle mate-rials such as ceramics (Section 12.11).
The modern microindentation hardness-testing equipment has been automated by 
coupling the indenter apparatus to an image analyzer that incorporates a computer and software package. The software controls important system functions, including indent location, indent spacing, computation of hardness values, and plotting of data.

Other hardness-testing techniques are frequently employed but will not be dis-
cussed here; these include ultrasonic microhardness, dynamic (Scleroscope), durometer 
(for plastic and elastomeric materials), and scratch hardness tests. These are described in references provided at the end of the chapter.
Hardness Conversion
The facility to convert the hardness measured on one scale to that of another is most desirable. However, because hardness is not a well-defined material property, and because of the experimental dissimilarities among the various techniques, a compre-hensive conversion scheme has not been devised. Hardness conversion data have been determined experimentally and found to be dependent on material type and character-istics. The most reliable conversion data exist for steels, some of which are presented in Figure 6.18 for Knoop, Vickers, Brinell, and two Rockwell scales; the Mohs scale is also included.

Correlation between Hardness and Tensile Strength
Both tensile strength and hardness are indicators of a metal’s resistance to plastic de-formation. Consequently, they are roughly proportional, as shown in Figure 6.19, for tensile strength as a function of the HB for cast iron, steel, and brass. The same propor-tionality relationship does not hold for all metals, as Figure 6.19 indicates. As a rule of thumb, for most steels, the HB and the tensile strength are related according to

Table 6.7
Summary of 
Mechanical Properties for Metals
Property Variability and Design/Safety Factors
At this point, it is worthwhile to discuss an issue that sometimes proves troublesome to 
many engineering students—namely, that measured material properties are not exact quantities. That is, even if we have a most precise measuring apparatus and a highly controlled test procedure, there will always be some scatter or variability in the data that are collected from specimens of the same material. For example, consider a num-ber of identical tensile samples that are prepared from a single bar of some metal alloy, which samples are subsequently stress–strain tested in the same apparatus. We would most likely observe that each resulting stress–strain plot is slightly different from the others. This would lead to a variety of modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and tensile strength values. A number of factors lead to uncertainties in measured data, including the test method, variations in specimen fabrication procedures, operator bias, and apparatus calibration. Furthermore, there might be inhomogeneities within the same lot of material and/or slight compositional and other differences from lot to lot. Of course, appropriate measures should be taken to minimize the possibility of measurement error and mitigate those factors that lead to data variability.
It should also be mentioned that scatter exists for other measured material proper-
ties, such as density, electrical conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion.
It is important for the design engineer to realize that scatter and variability of 
materials properties are inevitable and must be dealt with appropriately. On occasion, data must be subjected to statistical treatments and probabilities determined. For example, instead of asking, “What is the fracture strength of this alloy?” the engineer should become accustomed to asking, “What is the probability of failure of this alloy under these given circumstances?”
It is often desirable to specify a typical value and degree of dispersion (or scatter) 
for some measured property; this is commonly accomplished by taking the average and the standard deviation, respectively.
Computation of Average and Standard Deviation Values
An average value is obtained by dividing the sum of all measured values by the number 
of measurements taken. In mathematical terms, the average x of some parameter x  is

There will always be uncertainties in characterizing the magnitude of applied loads and their 
associated stress levels for in-service applications; typically, load calculations are only ap-proximate. Furthermore, as noted in Section 6.11, virtually all engineering materials exhibit a variability in their measured mechanical properties, have imperfections that were intro-duced during manufacture, and, in some instances, will have sustained damage during ser-vice. Consequently, design approaches must be employed to protect against unanticipated failure. During the 20th century, the protocol was to reduce the applied stress by a design 
safety factor. Although this is still an acceptable procedure for some structural applications, it does not provide adequate safety for critical applications such as those found in aircraft and bridge structural components. The current approach for these critical structural applica-tions is to utilize materials that have adequate toughnesses and also offer redundancy in the structural design (i.e., excess or duplicate structures), provided there are regular inspections to detect the presence of flaws and, when necessary, safely remove or repair components. (These topics are discussed in Chapter 8, Failure —specifically Section 8.5.)
For less critical static situations and when tough materials are used, a design stress, 
𝜎
d, is taken as the calculated stress level 𝜎c (on the basis of the estimated maximum load) 
multiplied by a design factor, Nʹ; that is,
 𝜎d=N′𝜎c (6.23)design stress6.12 DESIGN/SAFETY FACTORS
174  •   Chapter 6  /  Mechanical Properties of Metals
where Nʹ is greater than unity. Thus, the material to be used for the particular applica-
tion is chosen so as to have a yield strength at least as high as this value of 𝜎d.
Alternatively, a safe stress or working stress, 𝜎w, is used instead of design stress. 
This safe stress is based on the yield strength of the material and is defined as the yield 
strength divided by a factor of safety, N, or
 𝜎w=𝜎y
N (6.24)
Utilization of design stress (Equation 6.23) is usually preferred because it is based 
on the anticipated maximum applied stress instead of the yield strength of the material; normally, there is a greater uncertainty in estimating this stress level than in the speci-fication of the yield strength. However, in the discussion of this text, we are concerned with factors that influence the yield strengths of metal alloys and not in the determina-tion of applied stresses; therefore, the succeeding discussion deals with working stresses and factors of safety.
The choice of an appropriate value of N is necessary. If N is too large, then com-
ponent overdesign will result; that is, either too much material or an alloy having a higher-than-necessary strength will be used. Values normally range between 1.2 and 4.0. Selection of N will depend on a number of factors, including economics, previous experience, the accuracy with which mechanical forces and material properties may be determined, and, most important, the consequences of failure in terms of loss of life and/or property damage. Because large N values lead to increased material cost and weight, 
structural designers are moving toward using tougher materials with redundant (and inspectable) designs, where economically feasible.safe stress

DESIGN EXAMPLE 6.1
Specification of Support-Post Diameter
A tensile-testing apparatus is to be constructed that must withstand a maximum load of 220,000 N 
(50,000 lbf). The design calls for two cylindrical support posts, each of which is to support half of 
the maximum load. Furthermore, plain-carbon (1045) steel ground and polished shafting rounds are to be used; the minimum yield and tensile strengths of this alloy are 310 MPa (45,000 psi) and 565 MPa (82,000 psi), respectively. Specify a suitable diameter for these support posts.
Solution
The first step in this design process is to decide on a factor of safety, N, which then allows 
determination of a working stress according to Equation 6.24. In addition, to ensure that the 
apparatus will be safe to operate, we also want to minimize any elastic deflection of the rods during testing; therefore, a relatively conservative factor of safety is to be used, say N = 5. Thus, 
the working stress 𝜎

DESIGN EXAMPLE 6.2
Materials Specification for a Pressurized Cylindrical Tube
(a)  Consider a thin-walled cylindrical tube having a radius of 50 mm and wall thickness 2 mm 
that is to be used to transport pressurized gas. If inside and outside tube pressures are 20 and 
0.5 atm (2.027 and 0.057 MPa), respectively, which of the metals and alloys listed in Table 6.8 are suitable candidates? Assume a factor of safety of 4.0.
For a thin-walled cylinder, the circumferential (or “hoop”) stress (𝜎) depends on pres-
sure difference (Δp), cylinder radius (r
i), and tube wall thickness (t) as follows:
 𝜎=ri Δp
t (6.25)
These parameters are noted on the schematic sketch of a cylinder presented in Figure 6.21.
(b)  Determine which of the alloys that satisfy the criterion of part ( a) can be used to produce a 
tube with the lowest cost.
Solution
(a)  In order for this tube to transport the gas in a satisfactory and safe manner, we want to 
minimize the likelihood of plastic deformation. To accomplish this, we replace the circum-
ferential stress in Equation 6.25 with the yield strength of the tube material divided by the factor of safety, N—that is,
𝜎
y
N=ri Δp
t
And solving this expression for 𝜎y leads to
 𝜎y=Nri Δp
t (6.26)where d is the rod diameter and F is the applied force; furthermore, each of the two rods must 
support half of the total force, or 110,000 N (25,000 psi). Solving for d leads to
 d=2√F

Therefore, the diameter of each of the two rods should be 47.5 mm, or 1.87 in.

We now incorporate into this equation values of N, ri, Δp, and t given in the problem state-
ment and solve for 𝜎y. Alloys in Table 6.8 that have yield strengths greater than this value are 
suitable candidates for the tubing. Therefore,
𝜎y=(4.0)(50 ×10−3 m)(2.027 MPa −0.057 MPa)
(2×10−3 m)=197 MPa
Four of the six alloys in Table 6.8 have 
yield strengths greater than 197 MPa and satisfy the design criterion for this tube  —
that is, steel, copper, brass, and titanium.
(b)  To determine the tube cost for each alloy, 
it is fi  rst necessary to compute the tube volume V, which is equal to the product 
of cross-sectional area A and length L  —
that is,

Because the tube length L has not been specifi  ed, for the sake of convenience, we assume a value of 1.0 m. Incorporating values for r
i and t, provided in the problem statement leads to 
the following value for V:
 V=𝜋[(2)(50 ×10−3 m)(2 ×10−3 m)+(2×10−3 m)2](1 m)
 =6.28 ×10−4 m3=628 cm3
Next, it is necessary to determine the mass of each alloy (in kilograms) by multiplying this value of V by the alloy’s density, 𝜌  (Table 6.8) and then dividing by 1000, which is a unit-
conversion factor because 1000 mm =  1 m. Finally, cost of each alloy (in $US) is computed from 
the product of this mass and the unit mass cost ( c
) (Table 6.8). This procedure is expressed in 
equation form as follows:
 Cost =(V𝜌
1000)(c) (6.29)
For example, for steel,
Cost (steel) =[(628 cm3)(7.8 g ∕cm3)
(1000 g∕ kg) ](1.25 $US ∕kg)=$6.10
Cost values for steel and the other three alloys, as determined in the same manner, are tabu-lated below.

Summary  •   177
SUMMARY
• Three factors that should be considered in designing laboratory tests to assess the 
mechanical characteristics of materials for service use are the nature of the applied 
load (i.e., tension, compression, shear), load duration, and environmental conditions.
• For loading in tension and compression:
Engineering stress 𝜎 is defined as the instantaneous load divided by the original 
specimen cross-sectional area (Equation 6.1).
Engineering strain 𝜀 is expressed as the change in length (in the direction of load 
application) divided by the original length (Equation 6.2).
• A material that is stressed first undergoes elastic, or nonpermanent, deformation.
• When most materials are deformed elastically, stress and strain are proportional—that 
is, a plot of stress versus strain is linear.
• For tensile and compressive loading, the slope of the linear elastic region of the 
stress–strain curve is the modulus of elasticity ( E), per Hooke’s law (Equation 6.5).
• For a material that exhibits nonlinear elastic behavior, tangent and secant moduli are 
used.
• Elastic deformation that is dependent on time is termed anelastic.
• Another elastic parameter, Poisson’s ratio ( 𝜈), represents the negative ratio of trans-
verse and longitudinal strains ( 𝜀x and 𝜀z, respectively)—Equation 6.8.
• The phenomenon of yielding occurs at the onset of plastic or permanent deformation.
• Yield strength is indicative of the stress at which plastic deformation begins. For most 
materials, yield strength is determined from a stress–strain plot using the 0.002 strain 
offset technique.
• Tensile strength is taken as the stress level at the maximum point on the engineering 
stress–strain curve; it represents the maximum tensile stress that can be sustained by a specimen.
• Ductility is a measure of the degree to which a material plastically deforms by the time fracture occurs.
• Quantitatively, ductility is measured in terms of percents elongation and reduction in 
area.
• Yield and tensile strengths and ductility are sensitive to any prior deformation, the 
presence of impurities, and/or any heat treatment. Modulus of elasticity is relatively insensitive to these conditions.
• With increasing temperature, values of elastic modulus and tensile and yield strengths 
decrease, whereas the ductility increases.
• Modulus of resilience is the strain energy per unit volume of material required to stress a material to the point of yielding—or the area under the elastic portion of the engineering stress–strain curve. 
• A measure of toughness is the energy absorbed during the fracture of a material, as 
measured by the area under the entire engineering stress–strain curve. Ductile metals are normally tougher than brittle ones.
• True stress ( 𝜎
T) is defined as the instantaneous applied load divided by the instantane-
ous cross-sectional area (Equation 6.15).
• True strain ( 𝜀T) is equal to the natural logarithm of the ratio of instantaneous and 
original specimen lengths per Equation 6.16.Concepts of Stress

• For a specimen that has been plastically deformed, elastic strain recovery occurs if the 
load is released. This phenomenon is illustrated by the stress–strain plot of Figure 6.17.
• Hardness is a measure of a material’s resistance to localized plastic deformation.
• The two most common hardness testing techniques are the Rockwell and Brinell tests.• The two microindentation hardness testing techniques are the Knoop and Vickers 
tests. Small indenters and relatively light loads are employed for these two techniques. 
• For some metals, a plot of hardness versus tensile strength is linear—that is, these two 
parameters are proportional to one another.
• Five factors that can lead to scatter in measured material properties are the following: 
test method, variations in specimen fabrication procedure, operator bias, apparatus cali-
bration, and inhomogeneities and/or compositional variations from sample to sample.
• A typical material property is often specified in terms of an average value (
x), 
whereas magnitude of scatter may be expressed as a standard deviation ( s).
• As a result of uncertainties in both measured mechanical properties and in-service 
applied stresses, design or safe stresses are normally utilized for design purposes. For ductile materials, safe (or working) stress 𝜎
w is dependent on yield strength and factor 
of safety as described in Equation 6.24.Elastic Recovery after

WHY STUDY Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms?
Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Describe edge and screw dislocation motion from 
an atomic perspective.
2.  Describe how plastic deformation occurs by 
the motion of edge and screw dislocations in 
response to applied shear stresses.
3.  Define slip system and cite one example.4.  Describe how the grain structure of a poly-
crystalline metal is altered when it is plastically deformed.
5.  Explain how grain boundaries impede dislocation 
motion and why a metal having small grains is stronger than one having large grains.6.  Describe and explain solid-solution strengthen-
ing for substitutional impurity atoms in terms of lattice strain interactions with dislocations.
7.  Describe and explain the phenomenon of 
strain hardening (or cold working) in terms of dislocations and strain field interactions.
8.  Describe recrystallization in terms of both the 
alteration of microstructure and mechanical characteristics of the material.
9.  Describe the phenomenon of grain growth from 
both macroscopic and atomic perspectives.
Chapter 6 explained that materials may experience two kinds of deformation: elastic and 
plastic. Plastic deformation is permanent, and strength and hardness are measures of a material’s resistance to this deformation. On a microscopic scale, plastic deformation cor-responds to the net movement of large numbers of atoms in response to an applied stress. During this process, interatomic bonds must be ruptured and then re-formed. In crystalline solids, plastic deformation most often involves the motion of dislocations, linear crystalline defects that were introduced in Section 4.5. This chapter discusses the characteristics of dis-locations and their involvement in plastic deformation. Twinning, another process by which some metals deform plastically, is also treated. In addition, and probably most important, several techniques are presented for strengthening single-phase metals, the mechanisms of which are described in terms of dislocations. Finally, the latter sections of this chapter are concerned with recovery and recrystallization—processes that occur in plastically deformed metals, normally at elevated temperatures—and, in addition, grain growth.7.1 INTRODUCTION
Early materials studies led to the computation of the theoretical strengths of perfect crystals, which were many times greater than those actually measured. During the 1930s it was theorized that this discrepancy in mechanical strengths could be explained by a type of linear crystalline defect that has come to be known as a dislocation. Not until the 1950s, however, was the existence of such dislocation defects established by direct ob-servation with the electron microscope. Since then, a theory of dislocations has evolved that explains many of the physical and mechanical phenomena in metals [as well as crystalline ceramics (Section 12.10)].Dislocations and Plastic DeformationWith knowledge of the nature of dislocations and the 
role they play in the plastic deformation process, we are able to understand the underlying mechanisms of the techniques that are used to strengthen and harden metals and their alloys. Thus, it becomes pos-sible to  design and tailor the mechanical properties of materials— for example, the strength or toughness of a metal– matrix composite.

Edge and screw are the two fundamental dislocation types. In an edge dislocation, local-
ized lattice distortion exists along the end of an extra half-plane of atoms, which also defines the dislocation line (Figure 4.4). A screw dislocation may be thought of as result-ing from shear distortion; its dislocation line passes through the center of a spiral, atomic plane ramp (Figure 4.5). Many dislocations in crystalline materials have both edge and screw components; these are mixed dislocations (Figure 4.6). Plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations. An edge dislocation moves in response to a shear stress applied in a direction perpen-dicular to its line; the mechanics of dislocation motion are represented in Figure 7.1. Let the initial extra half-plane of atoms be plane A. When the shear stress is applied as 
indicated (Figure 7.1a), plane A is forced to the right; this in turn pushes the top halves of planes B, C, D, and so on, in the same direction. If the applied shear stress is of suf-
ficient magnitude, the interatomic bonds of plane B are severed along the shear plane, 
and the upper half of plane B becomes the extra half-plane as plane A links up with the bottom half of plane B (Figure 7.1b). This process is subsequently repeated for the other planes, such that the extra half-plane, by discrete steps, moves from left to right by suc-cessive and repeated breaking of bonds and shifting by interatomic distances of upper half-planes. Before and after the movement of a dislocation through some particular region of the crystal, the atomic arrangement is ordered and perfect; it is only during the passage of the extra half-plane that the lattice structure is disrupted. Ultimately, this extra half-plane may emerge from the right surface of the crystal, forming an edge that is one atomic distance wide; this is shown in Figure 7.1 c.
 The process by which plastic deformation is produced by dislocation motion is termed slip; the crystallographic plane along which the dislocation line traverses is 
the slip plane, as indicated in Figure 7.1. Macroscopic plastic deformation simply cor-
responds to permanent deformation that results from the movement of dislocations, or slip, in response to an applied shear stress, as represented in Figure 7.2 a.
 Dislocation motion is analogous to the mode of locomotion employed by a caterpil-lar (Figure 7.3). The caterpillar forms a hump near its posterior end by pulling in its last pair of legs a unit leg distance. The hump is propelled forward by repeated lifting and shifting of leg pairs. When the hump reaches the anterior end, the entire caterpillar has    : VMSE

moved forward by the leg separation distance. The caterpillar hump and its motion cor-
respond to the extra half-plane of atoms in the dislocation model of plastic deformation. The motion of a screw dislocation in response to the applied shear stress is shown in Figure 7.2b; the direction of movement is perpendicular to the stress direction. For an edge, motion is parallel to the shear stress. However, the net plastic deformation for the motion of both dislocation types is the same (see Figure 7.2). The direction of motion of the mixed dislocation line is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the applied stress, but lies somewhere in between. All metals and alloys contain some dislocations that were introduced during solidi-fication, during plastic deformation, and as a consequence of thermal stresses that result from rapid cooling. The number of dislocations, or dislocation density in a material, is 
expressed as the total dislocation length per unit volume or, equivalently, the number of dislocations that intersect a unit area of a random section. The units of dislocation density are millimeters of dislocation per cubic millimeter or just per square millimeter. Dislocation densities as low as 10
3 mm−2 are typically found in carefully solidified metal 
crystals. For heavily deformed metals, the density may run as high as 109 to 1010 mm−2. 
Heat-treating a deformed metal specimen can diminish the density to on the order of 10
5 to 106 mm−2. By way of contrast, a typical dislocation density for ceramic materials 
is between 102 and 104 mm−2; for silicon single crystals used in integrated circuits, the 
value normally lies between 0.1 and 1 mm−2.   : VMSE

Several characteristics of dislocations are important with regard to the mechanical prop-
erties of metals. These include strain fields that exist around dislocations, which are influ-ential in determining the mobility of the dislocations, as well as their ability to multiply. When metals are plastically deformed, some fraction of the deformation energy (ap-proximately 5%) is retained internally; the remainder is dissipated as heat. The major por-tion of this stored energy is as strain energy associated with dislocations. Consider the edge dislocation represented in Figure 7.4. As already mentioned, some atomic lattice distortion exists around the dislocation line because of the presence of the extra half-plane of atoms. As a consequence, there are regions in which compressive, tensile, and shear lattice strains  
are imposed on the neighboring atoms. For example, atoms immediately above and adja-cent to the dislocation line are squeezed together. As a result, these atoms may be thought of as experiencing a compressive strain relative to atoms positioned in the perfect crystal and far removed from the dislocation; this is illustrated in Figure 7.4. Directly below the half-plane, the effect is just the opposite; lattice atoms sustain an imposed tensile strain, which is as shown. Shear strains also exist in the vicinity of the edge dislocation. For a screw dislocation, lattice strains are pure shear only. These lattice distortions may be considered to be strain fields that radiate from the dislocation line. The strains extend into the sur-rounding atoms, and their magnitude decreases with radial distance from the dislocation. The strain fields surrounding dislocations in close proximity to one another may interact such that forces are imposed on each dislocation by the combined interactions of all its neighboring dislocations. For example, consider two edge dislocations that have the same sign and the identical slip plane, as represented in Figure 7.5a . The 
compressive and tensile strain fields for both lie on the same side of the slip plane; the strain field interaction is such that there exists between these two isolated dislocations a mutual repulsive force that tends to move them apart. However, two dislocations of opposite sign and having the same slip plane are attracted to one another, as indicated in Figure 7.5 b, and dislocation annihilation occurs when they meet. That is, the two 
extra half-planes of atoms align and become a complete plane. Dislocation interactions are possible among edge, screw, and/or mixed dislocations, and for a variety of orien-tations. These strain fields and associated forces are important in the strengthening mechanisms for metals. During plastic deformation, the number of dislocations increases dramatically. The dislocation density in a metal that has been highly deformed may be as high as 10
10 mm−2. One important source of these new dislocations is existing dislocations, 
which multiply; furthermore, grain boundaries, as well as internal defects and surface irregularities such as scratches and nicks, which act as stress concentrations, may serve as dislocation formation sites during deformation.lattice strain

within an FCC unit cell. (b) The (111) plane from 
(a) and three 〈110〉  slip directions (as indicated 
by arrows) within that plane constitute possible slip systems. Dislocations do not move with the same degree of ease on all crystallographic planes 
of atoms and in all crystallographic directions. Typically, there is a preferred plane, and in that plane there are specific directions along which dislocation motion occurs. This plane is called the slip plane; it follows that the direction of movement is called the slip direction. This combination of the slip plane and the slip direction is termed 
the slip system. The slip system depends on the crystal structure of the metal and 
is such that the atomic distortion that accompanies the motion of a dislocation is a minimum. For a particular crystal structure, the slip plane is the plane that has the densest atomic packing—that is, has the greatest planar density. The slip direction corresponds to the direction in this plane that is most closely packed with atoms—that is, has the highest linear density. Planar and linear atomic densities were discussed in Section 3.11. Consider, for example, the FCC crystal structure, a unit cell of which is shown in Figure 7.6a. There is a set of planes, the {111 } family, all of which are closely packed. 
A (111)-type plane is indicated in the unit cell; in Figure 7.6b, this plane is positioned slip system7.4 SLIP SYSTEMS

within the plane of the page, in which atoms are now represented as touching nearest 
neighbors. Slip occurs along 〈110〉 -type directions within the {111 } planes, as indicated by 
arrows in Figure 7.6. Hence, {111}〈110〉  represents the slip plane and direction combina-
tion, or the slip system for FCC. Figure 7.6 b demonstrates that a given slip plane may 
contain more than a single slip direction. Thus, several slip systems may exist for a par-ticular crystal structure; the number of independent slip systems represents the differ-ent possible combinations of slip planes and directions. For example, for face-centered cubic, there are 12 slip systems: four unique {111 } planes and, within each plane, three 
independent 〈110〉  directions.
 The possible slip systems for BCC and HCP crystal structures are listed in Table 7.1. For each of these structures, slip is possible on more than one family of planes (e.g., {110}, {211 }, and {321} for BCC). For metals having these two crystal structures, some slip 
systems are often operable only at elevated temperatures. Metals with FCC or BCC crystal structures have a relatively large number of slip systems (at least 12). These metals are quite ductile because extensive plastic deforma-tion is normally possible along the various systems. Conversely, HCP metals, having few active slip systems, are normally quite brittle. The Burgers vector, b , was introduced in Section 4.5, and shown for edge, screw, 
and mixed dislocations in Figures 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6, respectively. With regard to the process of slip, a Burgers vector’s direction corresponds to a dislocation’s slip direc-tion, whereas its magnitude is equal to the unit slip distance (or interatomic separa-tion in this direction). Of course, both the direction and the magnitude of b depend 
on crystal structure, and it is convenient to specify a Burgers vector in terms of unit cell edge length (a ) and crystallographic direction indices. Burgers vectors for face-
centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed crystal structures are as follows:

𝜆A further explanation of slip is simplified by treating the process in single crystals, then 
making the appropriate extension to polycrystalline materials. As mentioned previ-ously, edge, screw, and mixed dislocations move in response to shear stresses applied along a slip plane and in a slip direction. As noted in Section 6.2, even though an applied stress may be pure tensile (or compressive), shear components exist at all but parallel or perpendicular alignments to the stress direction (Equation 6.4b). These are termed 
resolved shear stresses, and their magnitudes depend not only on the applied stress, but 
also on the orientation of both the slip plane and direction within that plane. Let 𝜙 rep-
resent the angle between the normal to the slip plane and the applied stress direction, and let λ be the angle between the slip and stress directions, as indicated in Figure 7.7; it can then be shown that for the resolved shear stress 𝜏

where 𝜎 is the applied stress. In general, 𝜙 + λ ≠ 90° because it need not be the case that 
the tensile axis, the slip plane normal, and the slip direction all lie in the same plane. A metal single crystal has a number of different slip systems that are capable of op-erating. The resolved shear stress normally differs for each one because the orientation resolved shear stress

of each relative to the stress axis ( 𝜙 and λ angles) also differs. However, one slip system is 
generally oriented most favorably —that is, has the largest resolved shear stress, 𝜏R(max):
 𝜏R(max) =𝜎(cos  𝜙 cosλ)max (7.3)
In response to an applied tensile or compressive stress, slip in a single crystal commences on 
the most favorably oriented slip system when the resolved shear stress reaches some critical value, termed the critical resolved shear stress 𝜏
crss; it represents the minimum shear stress 
required to initiate slip and is a property of the material that determines when yielding  occurs. The single crystal plastically deforms or yields when 𝜏
R(max) = 𝜏crss, and the magni-
tude of the applied stress required to initiate yielding (i.e., the yield strength 𝜎y) is
 𝜎y=𝜏crss
(cos  𝜙 cos  λ)max (7.4)
The minimum stress necessary to introduce yielding occurs when a single crystal is ori-ented such that 𝜙=λ=45°; under these conditions,

 For a single-crystal specimen that is stressed in tension, deformation is as in Figure 7.8, where slip occurs along a number of equivalent and most favorably oriented planes and directions at various positions along the specimen length. This slip defor-mation forms as small steps on the surface of the single crystal that are parallel to one another and loop around the circumference of the specimen as indicated in Figure 7.8. Each step results from the movement of a large number of dislocations along the same slip plane. On the surface of a polished single-crystal specimen, these steps appear as lines, which are called slip lines. A schematic depiction of slip lines on a cylindrical speci-men that was plastically deformed in tension is shown in Figure 7.9.critical resolved

7.5 Slip in Single Crystals  •   189
 With continued extension of a single crystal, both the number of slip lines and the 
slip step width increase. For FCC and BCC metals, slip may eventually begin along a second slip system, the system that is next most favorably oriented with the tensile axis. Furthermore, for HCP crystals having few slip systems, if the stress axis for the most favorable slip system is either perpendicular to the slip direction ( λ = 90°) or parallel 
to the slip plane ( 𝜙 = 90°), the critical resolved shear stress is zero. For these extreme 
orientations, the crystal typically fractures rather than deforms plastically.
EXAMPLE PROBLEM 7.1
Resolved Shear Stress and Stress-to-Initiate-Yielding Computations
Consider a single crystal of BCC iron oriented such that a tensile stress is applied along a [010] direction.
(a) Compute the resolved shear stress along a (110) plane and in a [1
11] direction when a 
tensile stress of 52 MPa (7500 psi) is applied.
(b) If slip occurs on a (110) plane and in a [1 11] direction, and the critical resolved shear stress 
is 30 MPa (4350 psi), calculate the magnitude of the applied tensile stress necessary to  initiate yielding.
Solution
(a) A BCC unit cell along with the slip direction 
and plane as well as the direction of the ap-plied stress are shown in the accompanying diagram. In order to solve this problem, we must use Equation 7.2. However, it is first necessary to determine values for 𝜙 and λ, 
where, from this diagram, 𝜙 is the angle 
between the normal to the (110) slip plane (i.e., the [110] direction) and the [010] direc-tion, and λ represents the angle between the 
[1

cubic unit cells, the angle 𝜃 between direc-

Deformation and slip in polycrystalline materials is somewhat more complex. Because 
of the random crystallographic orientations of the numerous grains, the direction of slip varies from one grain to another. For each, dislocation motion occurs along the slip 
system that has the most favorable orientation, as defined earlier. This is exemplified by a photomicrograph of a polycrystalline copper specimen that has been plastically deformed (Figure 7.10); before deformation, the surface was polished. Slip lines
1 are 
visible, and it appears that two slip systems operated for most of the grains, as evi-denced by two sets of parallel yet intersecting sets of lines. Furthermore, variation in grain orientation is indicated by the difference in alignment of the slip lines for the several grains. Gross plastic deformation of a polycrystalline specimen corresponds to the comparable distortion of the individual grains by means of slip. During deformation, mechanical integrity and coherency are maintained along the grain boundaries—that is, the grain boundaries usually do not come apart or open up. As a consequence, each individual grain is constrained, to some degree, in the shape it may assume by its neighboring grains. The manner in which grains distort as a result of gross plastic deformation is indicated in Figure 7.11. Before deformation the grains are equiaxed,  
or have approximately the same dimension in all directions. For this particular defor-mation, the grains become elongated along the direction in which the specimen was extended.7.6 PLASTIC DEFORMATION OF POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS
1These slip lines are microscopic ledges produced by dislocations (Figure 7 .1c) that have exited from a grain and 
 appear as lines when viewed with a microscope. They are analogous to the macroscopic steps found on the surfaces 
of deformed single crystals (Figures 7 .8 and 7 .9).

100 μm 100 μm(a) (b) Polycrystalline metals are stronger than their single-crystal equivalents, which 
means that greater stresses are required to initiate slip and the attendant yielding. This is, to a large degree, also a result of geometric constraints that are imposed on the grains during deformation. Even though a single grain may be favorably oriented with the applied stress for slip, it cannot deform until the adjacent and less favorably oriented grains are capable of slip also; this requires a higher applied stress level.
192  •   Chapter 7  /  Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms
In addition to slip, plastic deformation in some metallic materials can occur by the 
formation of mechanical twins, or twinning. The concept of a twin was introduced in Section 4.6—that is, a shear force can produce atomic displacements such that on one side of a plane (the twin boundary), atoms are located in mirror-image positions of atoms on the other side. The manner in which this is accomplished is demonstrated in Figure 7.12. Blue circles in Figure 7.12b  represent atoms that did 
not move—red circles those that were displaced during twinning; magnitude of dis-placement is represented by red arrows. Furthermore, twinning occurs on a definite crystallographic plane and in a specific direction that depend on crystal structure. For example, for BCC metals, the twin plane and direction are (112) and [111], respectively. Slip and twinning deformations are compared in Figure 7.13 for a single crystal that is subjected to a shear stress 𝜏. Slip ledges are shown in Figure 7.13a ; their 
formation was described in Section 7.5. For twinning, the shear deformation is homogeneous (Figure 7.13b ). These two processes differ from each other in sev-
eral respects. First, for slip, the crystallographic orientation above and below the slip plane is the same both before and after the deformation; for twinning, there is a reorientation across the twin plane. In addition, slip occurs in distinct atomic spacing multiples, whereas the atomic displacement for twinning is less than the interatomic separation. Mechanical twinning occurs in metals that have BCC and HCP crystal structures, at low temperatures, and at high rates of loading (shock loading), conditions under which the slip process is restricted—that is, there are few operable slip systems. The amount of bulk plastic deformation from twinning is normally small relative to that resulting from slip. However, the real importance of twinning lies with the accompa-nying crystallographic reorientations; twinning may place new slip systems in orienta-tions that are favorable relative to the stress axis such that the slip process can now take place.7.7 DEFORMATION BY TWINNINGFigure 7.12  Schematic diagram showing how twinning results from an applied shear stress 𝜏.

atoms. Atoms labeled with corresponding primed and unprimmed letters (e.g., A ′ and A) reside in mirror-image 
positions across the twin boundary.

7.8 Strengthening by Grain Size Reduction  •   193
Metallurgical and materials engineers are often called on to design alloys having high 
strengths yet some ductility and toughness; typically, ductility is sacrificed when an alloy is strengthened. Several hardening techniques are at the disposal of an engineer, and frequently alloy selection depends on the capacity of a material to be tailored with the mechanical characteristics required for a particular application. Important to the understanding of strengthening mechanisms is the relation be-tween dislocation motion and mechanical behavior of metals. Because macroscopic plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations, the abil-
ity of a metal to deform plastically depends on the ability of dislocations to move. Because hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) are related to the ease with which plastic deformation can be made to occur, by reducing the mobility of dislocations, the me-chanical strength may be enhanced—that is, greater mechanical forces are required to initiate plastic deformation. In contrast, the more unconstrained the dislocation motion, the greater is the facility with which a metal may deform, and the softer and weaker it becomes. Virtually all strengthening techniques rely on this simple principle:  Restricting 
or hindering dislocation motion renders a material harder and stronger .
 The present discussion is confined to strengthening mechanisms for single-phase metals by grain size reduction, solid-solution alloying, and strain hardening. Deformation and strengthening of multiphase alloys are more complicated, involving concepts beyond the scope of the present discussion; Chapter 10 and Section 11.10 treat techniques that are used to strengthen multiphase alloys.

The size of the grains, or average grain diameter, in a polycrystalline metal influences the mechanical properties. Adjacent grains normally have different crystallographic orientations and, of course, a common grain boundary, as indicated in Figure 7.14. During plastic deformation, slip or dislocation motion must take place across this common boundary—say, from grain A to grain B in Figure 7.14. The grain boundary acts as a barrier to dislocation motion for two reasons:
 1. Because the two grains are of different orientations, a dislocation passing into 
grain B must change its direction of motion; this becomes more difficult as the 
crystallographic misorientation increases.
 2. The atomic disorder within a grain boundary region results in a discontinuity of 
slip planes from one grain into the other.
It should be mentioned that, for high-angle grain boundaries, it may not be the case that dislocations traverse grain boundaries during deformation; rather, dislocations tend to 7.8 STRENGTHENING BY GRAIN SIZE REDUCTION
194  •   Chapter 7  /  Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms
“pile up” (or back up) at grain boundaries. These pile-ups introduce stress concentra-
tions ahead of their slip planes, which generate new dislocations in adjacent grains. A fine-grained material (one that has small grains) is harder and stronger than one that is coarse grained because the former has a greater total grain boundary area to impede dislocation motion. For many materials, the yield strength 𝜎
y varies with grain 
size according to
 𝜎y=𝜎0+kyd−1/2 (7.7)
In this expression, termed the Hall–Petch equation, d is the average grain diameter, and 
𝜎0 and ky are constants for a particular material. Note that Equation 7.7 is not valid for 
both very large (i.e., coarse) grain and extremely fine grain polycrystalline materials. 
Figure 7.15 demonstrates the yield strength dependence on grain size for a brass alloy. Grain size may be regulated by the rate of solidification from the liquid phase, and also by plastic deformation followed by an appropriate heat treatment, as discussed in Section 7.13. It should also be mentioned that grain size reduction improves not only the strength, but also the toughness of many alloys.Hall–Petch

7.9 Solid-Solution Strengthening  •   195
 Small-angle grain boundaries (Section 4.6) are not effective in interfering with the 
slip process because of the slight crystallographic misalignment across the boundary. However, twin boundaries (Section 4.6) effectively block slip and increase the strength of the material. Boundaries between two different phases are also impediments to move-ments of dislocations; this is important in the strengthening of more complex alloys. The sizes and shapes of the constituent phases significantly affect the mechanical properties of multiphase alloys; these are the topics of discussion in Sections 10.7, 10.8, and 16.1.

(c)Another technique to strengthen and harden metals is alloying with impurity atoms 
that go into either substitutional or interstitial solid solution. Accordingly, this is called 
solid-solution strengthening. High-purity metals are almost always softer and weaker 
than alloys composed of the same base metal. Increasing the concentration of the impurity results in an attendant increase in tensile and yield strengths, as indicated in Figures 7.16a and 7.16b, respectively, for nickel in copper; the dependence of ductility on nickel concentration is presented in Figure 7.16 c.
 Alloys are stronger than pure metals because impurity atoms that go into solid solu-tion typically impose lattice strains on the surrounding host atoms. Lattice strain field solid-solution

interactions between dislocations and these impurity atoms result, and, consequently, 
dislocation movement is restricted. For example, an impurity atom that is smaller than a host atom for which it substitutes exerts tensile strains on the surrounding crystal lattice, as illustrated in Figure 7.17a. Conversely, a larger substitutional atom imposes compres-sive strains in its vicinity (Figure 7.18 a). These solute atoms tend to diffuse to and seg-
regate around dislocations in such a way as to reduce the overall strain energy—that is, to cancel some of the strain in the lattice surrounding a dislocation. To accomplish this, a smaller impurity atom is located where its tensile strain partially nullifies some of the dislocation’s compressive strain. For the edge dislocation in Figure 7.17 b, this would be 
adjacent to the dislocation line and above the slip plane. A larger impurity atom would be situated as in Figure 7.18b. The resistance to slip is greater when impurity atoms are present because the over-all lattice strain must increase if a dislocation is torn away from them. Furthermore, the same lattice strain interactions (Figures 7.17b  and 7.18 b) exist between impurity atoms 
and dislocations in motion during plastic deformation. Thus, a greater applied stress is necessary to first initiate and then continue plastic deformation for solid-solution alloys, as opposed to pure metals; this is evidenced by the enhancement of strength and hardness.Figure 7.17  (a) Representation of tensile lattice 
strains imposed on host atoms by a smaller substitutional

Strain hardening is the phenomenon by which a ductile metal becomes harder and 
stronger as it is plastically deformed. Sometimes it is also called work hardening, or, 
because the temperature at which deformation takes place is “cold” relative to the absolute melting temperature of the metal, cold working. Most metals strain harden at 
room temperature. It is sometimes convenient to express the degree of plastic deformation as percent 
cold work rather than as strain. Percent cold work (%CW) is defined as
 
%CW =(A0−Ad
A0)×100  (7.8)
where A0 is the original area of the cross section that experiences deformation and Ad 
is the area after deformation.

and tensile strength with increasing cold work. The price for this enhancement of  hardness strain hardening

and strength is in the ductility of the metal. This is shown in Figure 7.19 c, in which the 
ductility, in percent elongation, experiences a reduction with increasing percent cold work 
for the same three alloys. The influence of cold work on the stress–strain behavior of a low-carbon steel is shown in Figure 7.20; here, stress–strain curves are plotted at 0%CW, 4%CW, and 24%CW.Tutorial Video:

198  •   Chapter 7  /  Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms
 Strain hardening is demonstrated in a stress–strain diagram presented earlier 
(Figure 6.17). Initially, the metal with yield strength 𝜎y0 is plastically deformed to point 
D. The stress is released, then reapplied with a resultant new yield strength, 𝜎yi. The 
metal has thus become stronger during the process because 𝜎yi is greater than 𝜎y0.
 The strain-hardening phenomenon is explained on the basis of dislocation– dislocation strain field interactions similar to those discussed in Section 7.3. The disloca-tion density in a metal increases with deformation or cold work because of dislocation multiplication or the formation of new dislocations, as noted previously. Consequently, the average distance of separation between dislocations decreases—the dislocations are positioned closer together. On the average, dislocation–dislocation strain interactions are repulsive. The net result is that the motion of a dislocation is hindered by the pres-ence of other dislocations. As the dislocation density increases, this resistance to disloca-tion motion by other dislocations becomes more pronounced. Thus, the imposed stress necessary to deform a metal increases with increasing cold work. Strain hardening is often utilized commercially to enhance the mechanical proper-ties of metals during fabrication procedures. The effects of strain hardening may be removed by an annealing heat treatment, as discussed in Section 11.8. In the mathematical expression relating true stress and strain, Equation 6.19, the  parameter n is called the strain-hardening exponent, which is a measure of the ability of 
a metal to strain harden; the larger its magnitude, the greater is the strain hardening for a given amount of plastic strain.Figure 7.20  The influence

(50,000 psi). From Figure 7.19 c, the ductility at 35.6%CW is about 7%EL.
 In summary, we have discussed the three mechanisms that may be used to strengthen and harden single-phase metal alloys: strengthening by grain size reduction, solid-solution strengthening, and strain hardening. Of course, they may be used in conjunction with one another; for example, a solid-solution strengthened alloy may also be strain hardened. It should also be noted that the strengthening effects due to grain size reduction and strain hardening can be eliminated or at least reduced by an elevated-temperature heat treatment (Sections 7.12 and 7.13). In contrast, solid-solution strengthening is unaf-fected by heat treatment.
 As we shall see in Chapters 10 and 11, techniques other than those just discussed 
may be used to improve the mechanical properties of some metal alloys. These alloys are multiphase and property alterations result from phase transformations, which are induced by specifically designed heat treatments.
As outlined earlier in this chapter, plastically deforming a polycrystalline metal specimen at 
temperatures that are low relative to its absolute melting temperature produces microstruc-tural and property changes that include (1) a change in grain shape (Section 7.6), (2) strain hardening (Section 7.10), and (3) an increase in dislocation density (Section 7.3). Some frac-tion of the energy expended in deformation is stored in the metal as strain energy, which is associated with tensile, compressive, and shear zones around the newly created dislocations (Section 7.3). Furthermore, other properties, such as electrical conductivity (Section 18.8) and corrosion resistance, may be modified as a consequence of plastic deformation. These properties and structures may revert back to the precold-worked states by appropriate heat treatment (sometimes termed an annealing treatment). Such restora-
tion results from two different processes that occur at elevated temperatures: recovery 
and recrystallization, which may be followed by grain growth.
Recovery, Recrystallization, and Grain Growth
During recovery, some of the stored internal strain energy is relieved by virtue of dis-
location motion (in the absence of an externally applied stress), as a result of enhanced atomic diffusion at the elevated temperature. There is some reduction in the number recovery7.11 RECOVERYTutorial Video:
What Is Annealing and 
What Does It Do?

of dislocations, and dislocation configurations (similar to that shown in Figure 4.9) are 
produced having low strain energies. In addition, physical properties such as electrical and thermal conductivities recover to their precold-worked states.
Even after recovery is complete, the grains are still in a relatively high strain energy 
state. Recrystallization  is the formation of a new set of strain-free and equiaxed grains 
(i.e., having approximately equal dimensions in all directions) that have low dislocation densities and are characteristic of the precold-worked condition. The driving force to produce this new grain structure is the difference in internal energy between the strained and unstrained material. The new grains form as very small nuclei and grow until they completely consume the parent material, processes that involve short-range diffusion. Several stages in the recrystallization process are represented in Figures 7.21 a to 7.21d ; 
in these photomicrographs, the small speckled grains are those that have recrystallized. Thus, recrystallization of cold-worked metals may be used to refine the grain structure. Also, during recrystallization, the mechanical properties that were changed as a result of cold working are restored to their precold-worked values—that is, the metal becomes softer and weaker, yet more ductile. Some heat treatments are designed to allow recrystal-lization to occur with these modifications in the mechanical characteristics (Section 11.8). The extent of recrystallization depends on both time and temperature. The degree (or fraction) of recrystallization increases with time, as may be noted in the photomicro-graphs shown in Figures 7.21a to 7.21d. The explicit time dependence of recrystallization is addressed in more detail near the end of Section 10.3. The influence of temperature is demonstrated in Figure 7.22, which plots tensile strength and ductility (at room temperature) of a brass alloy as a function of the tem-perature and for a constant heat treatment time of 1 h. The grain structures found at the various stages of the process are also presented schematically. The recrystallization behavior of a particular metal alloy is sometimes specified in terms of a recrystallization temperature,  the temperature at which recrystallization just 
reaches completion in 1 h. Thus, the recrystallization temperature for the brass alloy of Figure 7.22 is about 450 °C (850° F). Typically, it is between one-third and one-half 
of the absolute melting temperature of a metal or alloy and depends on several fac-tors, including the amount of prior cold work and the purity of the alloy. Increasing the percent cold work enhances the rate of recrystallization, with the result that the recrystallization temperature is lowered, and approaches a constant or limiting value at high deformations; this effect is shown in Figure 7.23. Furthermore, it is this limiting or minimum recrystallization temperature that is normally specified in the literature. There exists some critical degree of cold work below which recrystallization  cannot be made to occur, as shown in the figure; typically, this is between 2% and 20% cold work. Recrystallization proceeds more rapidly in pure metals than in alloys. During re-crystallization, grain-boundary motion occurs as the new grain nuclei form and then grow. It is believed that impurity atoms preferentially segregate at and interact with these recrystallized grain boundaries so as to diminish their (i.e., grain boundary)  mobilities; this results in a decrease of the recrystallization rate and raises the recrystalli-zation temperature, sometimes quite substantially. For pure metals, the recrystallization temperature is normally 0.4 T
m, where Tm is the absolute melting temperature; for some 
commercial alloys it may run as high as 0.7 Tm. Recrystallization and melting tempera-
tures for a number of metals and alloys are listed in Table 7.2. It should be noted that because recrystallization rate depends on several variables, as discussed previously, there is some arbitrariness to recrystallization temperatures cited in the literature. Furthermore, some degree of recrystallization may occur for an alloy that is heat treated at temperatures below its recrystallization temperature.recrystallization

Description of Diameter Reduction Procedure
A cylindrical rod of noncold-worked brass having an initial diameter of 6.4 mm (0.25 in.) is to 
be cold worked by drawing such that the cross-sectional area is reduced. It is required to have a cold-worked yield strength of at least 345 MPa (50,000 psi) and a ductility in excess of 20%EL; in addition, a final diameter of 5.1 mm (0.20 in.) is necessary. Describe the manner in which this procedure may be carried out.
Solution
Let us first consider the consequences (in terms of yield strength and ductility) of cold working 
in which the brass specimen diameter is reduced from 6.4 mm (designated by d
0) to 5.1 mm (di). 
The %CW may be computed from Equation 7.8 as

204  •   Chapter 7  /  Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms
From Figures 7.19a and 7.19 c, a yield strength of 410 MPa (60,000 psi) and a ductility of 8%EL 
are attained from this deformation. According to the stipulated criteria, the yield strength is 
satisfactory; however, the ductility is too low. Another processing alternative is a partial diameter reduction, followed by a recrystal-lization heat treatment in which the effects of the cold work are nullified. The required yield strength, ductility, and diameter are achieved through a second drawing step. Again, reference to Figure 7.19a indicates that 20%CW is required to give a yield strength of 345 MPa. However, from Figure 7.19 c, ductilities greater than 20%EL are possible only for 
deformations of 23%CW or less. Thus during the final drawing operation, deformation must be between 20%CW and 23%CW. Let’s take the average of these extremes, 21.5%CW, and then calculate the final diameter for the first drawing d
0′, which becomes the original diameter 
for the second drawing. Again, using Equation 7.8,

Now, solving for d0′ from the preceding expression gives

After recrystallization is complete, the strain-free grains will continue to grow if the metal specimen is left at the elevated temperature (Figures 7.21d to 7.21f ); this phenom-
enon is called grain growth. Grain growth does not need to be preceded by recovery and 
recrystallization; it may occur in all polycrystalline materials, metals and ceramics alike.
 An energy is associated with grain boundaries, as explained in Section 4.6. As grains increase in size, the total boundary area decreases, yielding an attendant reduction in the total energy; this is the driving force for grain growth. Grain growth occurs by the migration of grain boundaries. Obviously, not all grains can enlarge, but large ones grow at the expense of small ones that shrink. Thus, the average grain size increases with time, and at any particular instant there exists a range of grain sizes. Boundary motion is just the short-range diffusion of atoms from one side of the boundary to the other. The directions of boundary movement and atomic motion are opposite to each other, as shown in Figure 7.24. For many polycrystalline materials, the grain diameter d varies with time t accord-ing to the relationship
 
dn−dn
0=Kt (7.9)
where d0 is the initial grain diameter at t = 0, and K and n are time-independent con-
stants; the value of n is generally equal to or greater than 2.
 The dependence of grain size on time and temperature is demonstrated in Figure 7.25, a plot of the logarithm of grain size as a function of the logarithm of time for a brass  alloy at several temperatures. At lower temperatures the curves are linear. Furthermore, grain growth proceeds more rapidly as temperature increases—that is, the curves are displaced upward to larger grain sizes. This is explained by the enhancement of diffusion rate with rising temperature. The mechanical properties at room temperature of a fine-grained metal are usually superior (i.e., higher strength and toughness) to those of coarse-grained ones. If the grain growth

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 7.3
Computation of Grain Size after Heat Treatment
When a hypothetical metal having a grain diameter of 8.2 × 10−3 mm is heated to 500°C for 
12.5 min, the grain diameter increases to 2.7 × 10−2 mm. Compute the grain diameter when a 
specimen of the original material is heated at 500 °C for 100 min. Assume the grain diameter 
exponent n has a value of 2.

It is first necessary to solve for the value of K. This is possible by incorporating the first set of 
data from the problem statement—that is,
d0 = 8.2 × 10−3 mm
 d = 2.7 × 10−2 mm
 t = 12.5 min
into the following rearranged form of Equation 7.10:

d=√d2

Substitution into this expression of t = 100 min, as well as values for d0 and K, yields

 =0.0732 mm
SUMMARY
• On a microscopic level, plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of dislocations 
in response to an externally applied shear stress. 
• For edge dislocations, dislocation line motion and direction of the applied shear stress 
are parallel; for screw dislocations, these directions are perpendicular.
• For an edge dislocation, tensile, compressive, and shear strains exist in the vicinity of 
the dislocation line. Shear lattice strains only are found for pure screw dislocations.Basic Concepts
• The motion of dislocations in response to an externally applied shear stress is 
termed slip.
• Slip occurs on specific crystallographic planes, and within these planes only in certain 
directions. A slip system represents a slip plane–slip direction combination.
• Operable slip systems depend on the crystal structure of the material. The slip plane 
is that plane that has the densest atomic packing, and the slip direction is the direction 
within this plane that is most closely packed with atoms.Slip Systems
• Resolved shear stress is the shear stress resulting from an applied tensile stress that is resolved onto a plane that is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the stress direction. 
• Critical resolved shear stress is the minimum resolved shear stress required to initiate dislocation motion (or slip). 
• For a single crystal that is pulled in tension, small steps form on the surface that are 
parallel and loop around the circumference of the specimen.Slip in Single Crystals
• For polycrystalline metals, slip occurs within each grain along those slip systems that 
are most favorably oriented with the applied stress. Furthermore, during deforma-tion, grains change shape and extend in those directions in which there is gross plastic deformation.Plastic Deformation 
of Polycrystalline 
Materials
• Under some circumstances, limited plastic deformation may occur in BCC and HCP 
metals by twinning —mechanical twins form in response to the application of shear forces.Deformation by 
Twinning
Summary  •   207
• The ease with which a metal is capable of plastic deformation is a function of disloca-
tion mobility—that is, restricting dislocation motion leads to increased hardness and 
strength.Mechanisms of 
Strengthening in 
Metals
• Grain boundaries are barriers to dislocation motion for two reasons:
When crossing a grain boundary, a dislocation’s direction of motion must change.There is a discontinuity of slip planes within the vicinity of a grain boundary.
• A metal that has small grains is stronger than one with large grains because the 
former has more grain boundary area and, thus, more barriers to dislocation motion.Strengthening by 
Grain Size Reduction
• The strength and hardness of a metal increase with increase of concentration of 
impurity atoms that go into solid solution (both substitutional and interstitial).
• Solid-solution strengthening results from lattice strain interactions between impurity 
atoms and dislocations; these interactions produce a decrease in dislocation mobility.Solid-Solution 
Strengthening
• Strain hardening is the enhancement in strength (and decrease of ductility) of a metal as it is deformed plastically.
• Yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness of a metal increase with increasing 
 percent cold work (Figures 7.19a and 7.19b); ductility decreases (Figure 7.19 c).
• During plastic deformation, dislocation density increases and repulsive dislocation–
dislocation strain field interactions increase; this leads to lower dislocation mobilities and increases in strength and hardness.Strain Hardening
• During recovery:
There is some relief of internal strain energy by dislocation motion.Dislocation density decreases, and dislocations assume low-energy configurations.Some material properties revert back to their precold-worked values.Recovery
• During recrystallization:
A new set of strain-free and equiaxed grains form that have relatively low 
 dislocation densities.
The metal becomes softer, weaker, and more ductile.
• For a cold-worked metal that experiences recrystallization, as temperature increases 
(at constant heat-treating time), tensile strength decreases and ductility increases (per Figure 7.22).
• The recrystallization temperature of a metal alloy is that temperature at which recrys-
tallization reaches completion in 1 h.
• Two factors that influence the recrystallization temperature are percent cold work 
and impurity content.
Recrystallization temperature decreases with increasing percent cold work.
It rises with increasing concentrations of impurities.
• Plastic deformation of a metal above its recrystallization temperature is hot working; 
deformation below its recrystallization temperature is termed cold working.Recrystallization
• Grain growth is the increase in average grain size of polycrystalline materials, which 
proceeds by grain boundary motion.
• The time dependence of grain size is represented by Equation 7.9.Grain Growth

H ave you ever experienced 
the aggravation of having to 
 expend considerable effort to tear open a small plastic package that  contains nuts, candy, or some other  confection? You probably have also noticed that when a small incision (or cut) has been made into an edge, as appears in  photograph (a), a minimal force is required to tear the package open. This phenomenon is related to one of the basic  tenets of fracture mechanics: an applied tensile stress is amplified at the tip of a small incision or notch.
Photograph (b) is of an oil tanker that fractured in a brittle manner as a result of the propagation of a crack completely 
around its girth. This crack started as some type of small notch or sharp flaw. As the tanker was buffeted about while at sea,  resulting stresses became amplified at the tip of this notch or flaw to the degree that a crack formed and rapidly elongated, which ultimately led to complete fracture of the tanker.
Photograph (c) is of a Boeing 737-200 commercial aircraft (Aloha Airlines flight 243) that experienced an  explosive 
decompression and structural failure on April 28, 1988. An investigation of the accident concluded that the cause was metal fatigue aggravated by crevice corrosion (Section 17.7) inasmuch as the plane operated in a coastal (humid and salty)  environment. Stress cycling of the fuselage resulted from compression and decompression of the cabin chamber during short hop flights. A properly executed maintenance program by the airline would have detected the fatigue damage and prevented this accident.

  •  209
The design of a component or structure often calls 
upon the engineer to minimize the possibility of   failure. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanics of the various failure modes—fracture, fatigue, and  creep—and, in addition, be familiar with appropriate design principles that may be employed to prevent in-service failures. For example, in Sections M.7 and M.8 of the Mechanical Engineering Online Support Module, we discuss material selection and processing issues relating to the fatigue of an automobile valve spring. WHY STUDY Failure?
Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Describe the mechanism of crack propagation 
for both ductile and brittle modes of fracture.
2.  Explain why the strengths of brittle materials 
are much lower than predicted by theoretical calculations.
3.  Define fracture toughness in terms of (a) a 
brief statement and (b) an equation; define all 
 parameters in this equation.
4.  Make a distinction between fracture toughness  
and plane strain fracture toughness.
5.  Name and describe the two impact fracture testing techniques.6.  Define fatigue and specify the conditions under 
which it occurs.
7.  From a fatigue plot for some material, determine
(a) the fatigue lifetime (at a specified stress 
level) and (b) the fat igue strength (at a 
specified number of cycles).
8.  Define creep and specify the conditions under 
which it occurs.
9.  Given a creep plot for some material, determine 
(a) the steady-state creep rate and (b) the rupture lifetime.
The failure of engineering materials is almost always an undesirable event for several 
reasons; these include putting human lives in jeopardy, causing economic losses, and interfering with the availability of products and services. Even though the causes of failure and the behavior of materials may be known, prevention of failures is difficult to guarantee. The usual causes are improper materials selection and processing and inadequate design of the component or its misuse. Also, damage can occur to structural parts during service, and regular inspection and repair or replacement are critical to safe design. It is the responsibility of the engineer to anticipate and plan for possible failure and, in the event that failure does occur, to assess its cause and then take appropriate preventive measures against future incidents.
The following topics are addressed in this chapter: simple fracture (both ductile 
and brittle modes), fundamentals of fracture mechanics, fracture toughness testing, the ductile-to-brittle transition, fatigue, and creep. These discussions include failure mechanisms, testing techniques, and methods by which failure may be prevented or controlled.Tutorial Video:

8.3 Ductile Fracture  •   211
Simple fracture is the separation of a body into two or more pieces in response to an im-
posed stress that is static (i.e., constant or slowly changing with time) and at  temperatures that are low relative to the melting temperature of the material. Fracture can also occur from fatigue (when cyclic stresses are imposed) and creep (time-dependent deformation, 
normally at elevated temperatures); the topics of fatigue and creep are covered later in this chapter (Sections 8.7 through 8.15). Although applied stresses may be tensile, compressive, shear, or torsional (or combinations of these), the present  discussion will 
be confined to fractures that result from uniaxial tensile loads. For  metals, two fracture 
modes are possible: ductile and brittle. Classification is based on the  ability of a material 
to experience plastic deformation. Ductile metals typically exhibit substantial plastic de-formation with high energy absorption before fracture. However, there is  normally little or no plastic deformation with low energy absorption accompanying a brittle fracture. The tensile stress–strain behaviors of both fracture types may be  reviewed in Figure 6.13.
Ductile and brittle are relative terms; whether a particular fracture is one mode or the 
other depends on the situation. Ductility may be quantified in terms of percent elongation (Equation 6.11) and percent reduction in area (Equation 6.12). Furthermore, ductility is a function of temperature of the material, the strain rate, and the stress state. The disposi-tion of normally ductile materials to fail in a brittle manner is discussed in Section 8.6.
Any fracture process involves two steps—crack formation and propagation—in 
response to an imposed stress. The mode of fracture is highly dependent on the mecha-nism of crack propagation. Ductile fracture is characterized by extensive plastic defor-mation in the vicinity of an advancing crack. The process proceeds relatively slowly as the crack length is extended. Such a crack is often said to be stable —that is, it resists any 
further extension unless there is an increase in the applied stress. In addition, there typi-cally is evidence of appreciable gross deformation at the fracture surfaces (e.g., twisting and tearing). However, for brittle fracture, cracks may spread extremely rapidly, with very little accompanying plastic deformation. Such cracks may be said to be unstable, 
and crack propagation, once started, continues spontaneously without an increase in magnitude of the applied stress.
Ductile fracture is almost always preferred to brittle fracture for two reasons: 
First, brittle fracture occurs suddenly and catastrophically without any warning; this is a consequence of the spontaneous and rapid crack propagation. By contrast, in ductile fracture, the presence of plastic deformation gives warning that failure is imminent, allowing preventive measures to be taken. Second, more strain energy is required to induce ductile fracture inasmuch as these materials are generally tougher. Under the action of an applied tensile stress, many metal alloys are ductile, whereas ceramics are typically brittle, and polymers may exhibit a range of behaviors.ductile fracture,

8.3 DUCTILE FRACTURE
Ductile fracture surfaces have distinctive features on both macroscopic and microscopic 
levels. Figure 8.1 shows schematic representations for two characteristic macroscopic fracture profiles. The configuration shown in Figure 8.1 a is found for extremely soft 
metals, such as pure gold and lead at room temperature, and other metals, polymers, and inorganic glasses at elevated temperatures. These highly ductile materials neck down to a point fracture, showing virtually 100% reduction in area.
The most common type of tensile fracture profile for ductile metals is that repre-
sented in Figure 8.1b, where fracture is preceded by only a moderate amount of necking. The fracture process normally occurs in several stages (Figure 8.2). First, after necking 
212  •   Chapter 8  /  Failure
begins, small cavities, or microvoids, form in the interior of the cross section, as indi-
cated in Figure 8.2b. Next, as deformation continues, these microvoids enlarge, come together, and coalesce to form an elliptical crack, which has its long axis perpendicular to the stress direction. The crack continues to grow in a direction parallel to its major axis by this microvoid coalescence process (Figure 8.2 c). Finally, fracture ensues by the 
rapid propagation of a crack around the outer perimeter of the neck (Figure 8.2 d) by 
shear deformation at an angle of about 45 ° with the tensile axis —the angle at which the 
shear stress is a maximum. Sometimes a fracture having this characteristic surface con-tour is termed a cup-and-cone fracture because one of the mating surfaces is in the form of a cup and the other like a cone. In this type of fractured specimen (Figure 8.3a), the central interior region of the surface has an irregular and fibrous appearance, which is indicative of plastic deformation.Figure 8.1  (a) Highly ductile fracture in

Fractographic Studies
Much more detailed information regarding the mechanism of fracture is available from 
microscopic examination, normally using scanning electron microscopy. Studies of this type are termed fractographic. The scanning electron microscope is preferred for fractographic examinations because it has a much better resolution and depth of field than does the optical microscope; these characteristics are necessary to reveal the topo-graphical features of fracture surfaces.
When the fibrous central region of a cup-and-cone fracture surface is examined 
with the electron microscope at a high magnification, it is found to consist of nu-merous spherical “dimples” (Figure 8.4a ); this structure is characteristic of fracture 
resulting from uniaxial tensile failure. Each dimple is one half of a microvoid that formed and then separated during the fracture process. Dimples also form on the 45° shear lip of the cup-and-cone fracture. However, these will be elongated or 
C-shaped, as shown in Figure 8.4b . This parabolic shape may be indicative of shear 
failure. Furthermore, other microscopic fracture surface features are also possible. Fractographs such as those shown in Figures 8.4a  and 8.4 b provide valuable informa-
tion in the analyses of fracture, such as the fracture mode, the stress state, and the site of crack initiation.Figure 8.4  (a) Scanning electron fractograph showing spherical dimples characteristic of d uctile fracture resulting

8.4 BRITTLE FRACTURE
Brittle fracture takes place without any appreciable deformation and by rapid crack propagation. The direction of crack motion is very nearly perpendicular to the  direction of the applied tensile stress and yields a relatively flat fracture surface, as indicated in Figure 8.1c .
Fracture surfaces of materials that fail in a brittle manner have distinctive patterns; 
any signs of gross plastic deformation are absent. For example, in some steel pieces, a series of V-shaped “chevron” markings may form near the center of the fracture cross section that point back toward the crack initiation site (Figure 8.5 a). Other brittle frac-
ture surfaces contain lines or ridges that radiate from the origin of the crack in a fanlike pattern (Figure 8.5b). Often, both of these marking patterns are sufficiently coarse to be

discerned with the naked eye. For very hard and fine-grained metals, there is no discernible 
fracture pattern. Brittle fracture in amorphous materials, such as ceramic glasses, yields a relatively shiny and smooth surface.
For most brittle crystalline materials, crack propagation corresponds to the 
 successive and repeated breaking of atomic bonds along specific crystallographic planes (Figure 8.6a); such a process is termed cleavage. This type of fracture is said to be 
transgranular (or transcrystalline) because the fracture cracks pass through the grains. Macroscopically, the fracture surface may have a grainy or faceted texture (Figure 8.3 b) 
as a result of changes in orientation of the cleavage planes from grain to grain. This cleavage feature is shown at a higher magnification in the scanning electron micrograph of Figure 8.6b.transgranular

8.5 PRINCIPLES OF FRACTURE MECHANICS1
Brittle fracture of normally ductile materials, such as that shown in the chapter-opening 
Figure b (of the oil barge), has demonstrated the need for a better understanding of the 
mechanisms of fracture. Extensive research endeavors over the past century have led to the evolution of the field of fracture mechanics. This subject allows quantification of the 
relationships among material properties, stress level, the presence of crack-producing flaws, and crack propagation mechanisms. Design engineers are now better equipped to anticipate, and thus prevent, structural failures. The present discussion centers on some of the fundamental principles of the mechanics of fracture.fracture mechanics

Engineering (ME) Online Module, which may be found in all digital versions of this text or at www.wiley.com/

216  •   Chapter 8  /  Failure
Stress Concentration
The measured fracture strengths for most materials are significantly lower than those 
predicted by theoretical calculations based on atomic bonding energies. This discrep-ancy is explained by the presence of microscopic flaws or cracks that always exist under normal conditions at the surface and within the interior of a body of material. These flaws are a detriment to the fracture strength because an applied stress may be amplified or concentrated at the tip, the magnitude of this amplification depending on crack ori-entation and geometry. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 8.8—a stress profile across a cross section containing an internal crack. As indicated by this profile, the mag-nitude of this localized stress decreases with distance away from the crack tip. At posi-tions far removed, the stress is just the nominal stress 𝜎
0, or the applied load divided by 
the specimen cross-sectional area (perpendicular to this load). Because of their ability to amplify an applied stress in their locale, these flaws are sometimes called stress raisers.
If it is assumed that a crack is similar to an elliptical hole through a plate and is 
oriented perpendicular to the applied stress, the maximum stress, 𝜎
m, occurs at the crack 
tip and may be approximated by
 𝜎m=2𝜎0(a
𝜌t)1/2
 (8.1)
where 𝜎0 is the magnitude of the nominal applied tensile stress, 𝜌t is the radius of curva-
ture of the crack tip (Figure 8.8a), and a represents the length of a surface crack, or half 
of the length of an internal crack. For a relatively long microcrack that has a small tip stress raiser

 radius of curvature, the factor (a/ 𝜌t)1/2 may be very large. This yields a value of 𝜎m that 
is many times the value of 𝜎0.
Sometimes the ratio 𝜎m/𝜎0 is denoted the stress concentration factor Kt:
 Kt=𝜎m
𝜎0=2(a
𝜌t)1/2
 (8.2)
which is simply a measure of the degree to which an external stress is amplified at the 
tip of a crack.
Note that stress amplification is not restricted to these microscopic defects; it may 
occur at macroscopic internal discontinuities (e.g., voids or inclusions), sharp corners, scratches, and notches.
Furthermore, the effect of a stress raiser is more significant in brittle than in ductile 
materials. For a ductile metal, plastic deformation ensues when the maximum stress ex-ceeds the yield strength. This leads to a more uniform distribution of stress in the vicinity of the stress raiser and to the development of a maximum stress concentration factor less than the theoretical value. Such yielding and stress redistribution do not occur to Figure 8.8  (a) The geometry of surface 
and internal cracks. (b) Schematic stress

Fracture Toughness
Using fracture mechanical principles, an expression has been developed that relates this 
critical stress for crack propagation ( 𝜎c) and crack length (a) as
 Kc=Y𝜎c√𝜋a (8.4)
In this expression Kc is the fracture toughness, a property that is a measure of a mat-
erial’s resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present. Kc has the unusual units of 
MPa √m or psi √in. (alternatively, ksi √in.). Here, Y is a dimensionless parameter or 
function that depends on both crack and specimen sizes and geometries as well as on the manner of load application.
Relative to this Y parameter, for planar specimens containing cracks that are much 
shorter than the specimen width, Y has a value of approximately unity. For example, for a plate of infinite width having a through-thickness crack (Figure 8.9 a), Y = 1.0, whereas 
for a plate of semi-infinite width containing an edge crack of length a (Figure  8.9b), 
Y ≅  1.1. Mathematical expressions for Y have been determined for a variety of crack-
specimen geometries; these expressions are often relatively complex.Fracture toughness—
dependence on  critical stress for crack propagation and crack length
fracture toughnessany appreciable extent around flaws and discontinuities in brittle materials; therefore, 
essentially the theoretical stress concentration results.
Using principles of fracture mechanics, it is possible to show that the critical stress 
𝜎c required for crack propagation in a brittle material is described by the expression
 𝜎c=(2E𝛾s
𝜋a)1/2
 (8.3)
where E is modulus of elasticity, 𝛾s is the specific surface energy, and a is one-half the 
length of an internal crack.
All brittle materials contain a population of small cracks and flaws that have a variety 
of sizes, geometries, and orientations. When the magnitude of a tensile stress at the tip of one of these flaws exceeds the value of this critical stress, a crack forms and then propa-gates, which results in fracture. Very small and virtually defect-free metallic and ceramic whiskers have been grown with fracture strengths that approach their theoretical values. Critical stress for 
crack propagation in a brittle material
Maximum Flaw Length Computation
A relatively large plate of a glass is subjected to a tensile stress of 40 MPa. If the specific surface 
energy and modulus of elasticity for this glass are 0.3 J/m2 and 69 GPa, respectively, determine 
the maximum length of a surface flaw that is possible without fracture.
Solution
To solve this problem it is necessary to employ Equation 8.3. Rearranging this expression such that 
a is the dependent variable, and realizing that 𝜎 = 40 MPa, 𝛾s = 0.3 J/m2, and E = 69 GPa, leads to

8.5 Principles of Fracture Mechanics  •   219
For relatively thin specimens, the value of Kc depends on specimen thickness. 
However, when specimen thickness is much greater than the crack dimensions, Kc 
becomes independent of thickness; under these conditions a condition of plane strain 
exists. By plane strain, we mean that when a load operates on a crack in the manner 
represented in Figure 8.9 a, there is no strain component perpendicular to the front and 
back faces. The Kc value for this thick-specimen situation is known as the plane strain 
fracture toughness, KIc; it is also defined by
 KIc=Y𝜎√𝜋a (8.5)
KIc is the fracture toughness cited for most situations. The I (i.e., Roman numeral 
“one”) subscript for KIc denotes that the plane strain fracture toughness is for mode I 
crack displacement, as illustrated in Figure 8.10 a.2
Brittle materials, for which appreciable plastic deformation is not possible in front 
of an advancing crack, have low KIc values and are vulnerable to catastrophic failure. 
However, KIc values are relatively large for ductile materials. Fracture mechanics is 
especially useful in predicting catastrophic failure in materials having intermediate ductilities. Plane strain fracture toughness values for a number of different materials are presented in Table 8.1 (and Figure 1.7); a more extensive list of K
Ic values is given 
in Table B.5, Appendix B.

and microstructure. The magnitude of KIc decreases with increasing strain rate and 
decreasing temperature. Furthermore, an enhancement in yield strength wrought by 
solid solution or dispersion additions or by strain hardening generally produces a cor-responding decrease in K
Ic. In addition, KIc normally increases with reduction in grain 
size as composition and other microstructural variables are maintained constant. Yield strengths are included for some of the materials listed in Table 8.1. Several different testing techniques are used to measure K
Ic (see Section 8.6). 
Virtually any specimen size and shape consistent with mode I crack displacement may be utilized, and accurate values will be realized, provided that the Y scale parameter in 
Equation 8.5 has been determined properly.
Design Using Fracture Mechanics
According to Equations 8.4 and 8.5, three variables must be considered relative to the possibility for fracture of some structural component—namely, the fracture toughness (K
c) or plane strain fracture toughness (KIc), the imposed stress ( 𝜎), and  
the flaw size (a)—assuming, of course, that Y has been determined. When designing a component, it is first important to decide which of these variables are c onstrained by the application and which are subject to design control. For example, material selection (and hence K
c or KIc) is often dictated by factors such as density (for lightweight applica-
tions) or the corrosion characteristics of the environment. Alternatively, the allowable flaw size is either measured or specified by the limitations of available flaw detection techniques. It is important to realize, however, that once any combination of two of the preceding parameters is prescribed, the third becomes fixed (Equations 8.4 and 8.5). For example, assume that K
Ic and the magnitude of a are specified by application con-
straints; therefore, the design (or critical) stress σc is given by

A number of nondestructive test (NDT) techniques have been developed that 
permit detection and measurement of both internal and surface flaws.3 Such techniques 
are used to examine structural components that are in service for defects and flaws that could lead to premature failure; in addition, NDTs are used as a means of quality con-trol for manufacturing processes. As the name implies, these techniques do not destroy the material/structure being examined. Furthermore, some testing methods must be conducted in a laboratory setting; others may be adapted for use in the field. Several commonly employed NDT techniques and their characteristics are
 listed in Table 8.2.4
One important example of the use of NDT is for the detection of cracks and leaks in the 
walls of oil pipelines in remote areas such as Alaska. Ultrasonic analysis is utilized in con-junction with a “robotic analyzer” that can travel relatively long distances within a pipeline.Computation of

5Crack propagation may occur due to cyclic loading associated with fluctuations in pressure, or as a result of aggressive 
chemical attack of the wall material.DESIGN EXAMPLE 8.1
Material Specification for a Pressurized Cylindrical Tank
Consider a thin-walled cylindrical tank of radius 0.5 m (500 mm) and wall thickness of 8.0 mm that 
is to be used as a pressure vessel to contain a fluid at a pressure of 2.0 MPa. Assume a crack exists within the tank’s wall that is propagating from the inside to the outside as shown in Figure 8.11.
5 
Regarding the likelihood of failure of this pressure vessel, two scenarios are possible:
1.  Leak-before-break. Using principles of fracture mechanics, allowance is made for the growth of the crack through the thickness of the vessel wall prior to rapid propagation. Thus, the crack will completely penetrate the wall without catastrophic failure, allowing for its detection by the leaking of pressurized fluid.
222  •   Chapter 8  /  Failure
2.  Brittle fracture . When the 
advancing crack reaches a 
critical length, which is shorter than for leak-before-break, fracture occurs by its rapid propagation through the entirety of the wall. This event typically results in the explosive expulsion of the vessel’s fluid contents.
 Obviously, leak-before-break is almost always the pre-
ferred scenario. For a cylindrical pressure vessel, the circumferential (or hoop) stress 𝜎
h on the wall is a 
function of the pressure p in the vessel and the radius r and wall thickness t according to the following expression:
 𝜎
h=pr
t (8.8)
Using values of p, r, and t provided earlier, we compute the hoop stress for this vessel as follows:
 𝜎h=(2.0 MPa)(0.5 m)
8×10−3 m
 =125 MPa
 Upon consideration of the metal alloys listed in Table B.5 of Appendix B, determine which 
satisfy the following criteria:
(a) Leak-before-break
(b) Brittle fracture
 Use minimum fracture toughness values when ranges are specified in Table B.5. Assume a factor of safety value of 3.0 for this problem.
Solution
(a)  A propagating surface crack will assume a configuration shown schematically in Figure 
8.12—having a semicircular shape in a plane perpendicular to the stress direction and a 
length of 2c (and also a depth of a where a = c). It can be shown
6 as the crack penetrates the 
outer wall surface that 2c = 2t (i.e., c = t). Thus, the leak-before-break condition is satisfied 
when a crack’s length is equal to or greater than the vessel wall thickness—that is, there is a critical crack length for leak-before-break c
c defined as follows:
 cc≥t (8.9)
 Critical crack length cc may be computed using a form of Equation 8.7. Furthermore, 
because crack length is much smaller than the width of the vessel wall, a condition similar to Figure 8.11  Schematic diagram showing the cross section of

Therefore, for a specific wall material, leak-before-break is possible when the value of its 
critical crack length (per Equation 8.10) is equal to or greater than the pressure vessel wall 
thickness. For example, consider steel alloy 4140 that has been tempered at 370°C. Because K
Ic values 
for this alloy range between 55 and 65 MPa √m, we use the minimum value (55 MPa √m) 
as called for. Incorporating values for N (3.0) and 𝜎h (125 MPa, as determined previously) into

A number of different standardized tests have been devised to measure the fracture 
toughness values for structural materials.7 In the United States, these standard test 
methods are developed by the ASTM. Procedures and specimen configurations for most tests are relatively complicated, and we will not attempt to provide detailed explanations. In brief, for each test type, the specimen (of specified geometry and size) contains a preexisting defect, usually a sharp crack that has been introduced. The test apparatus loads the specimen at a specified rate, and also measures load and crack displacement values. Data are subjected to analyses to ensure that they meet 8.6 FRACTURE TOUGHNESS TESTING Leak-before-break critical crack lengths for the other alloys in Table B.5 are determined in like manner; their values are tabulated in Table 8.3.

established criteria before the fracture toughness values are deemed acceptable. 
Most tests are for metals, but some have also been developed for ceramics, poly-mers, and composites.
Impact Testing Techniques
Prior to the advent of fracture mechanics as a scientific discipline, impact testing techniques were established to ascertain the fracture characteristics of materials at high loading rates. It was realized that the results of laboratory tensile tests (at low loading rates) could not be extrapolated to predict fracture behavior. For example, under some circumstances, normally ductile metals fracture abruptly and with very little plastic deformation under high loading rates. Impact test conditions were cho-sen to represent those most severe relative to the potential for fracture—namely, (1) deformation at a relatively low temperature, (2) a high strain rate (i.e., rate of deformation), and (3) a triaxial stress state (which may be introduced by the presence of a notch).
Two standardized tests,
8 the Charpy and the Izod, are used to measure the 
impact energy (sometimes also termed notch toughness). The Charpy V-notch (CVN) technique is most commonly used in the United States. For both the Charpy and the Izod, the specimen is in the shape of a bar of square cross section, into which a V-notch is machined (Figure 8.13a ). The apparatus for making V-notch impact 
tests is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.13b . The load is applied as an impact 
blow from a weighted pendulum hammer released from a cocked position at a fixed height h. The specimen is positioned at the base as shown. Upon release, a knife 
edge mounted on the pendulum strikes and fractures the specimen at the notch, which acts as a point of stress concentration for this high-velocity impact blow. The pendulum continues its swing, rising to a maximum height h ′, which is lower than h . 
The energy absorption, computed from the difference between h  and h ′, is a mea-
sure of the impact energy. The primary difference between the Charpy and the Izod techniques lies in the manner of specimen support, as illustrated in Figure 8.13 b. 
These are termed impact tests because of the manner of load application. Several variables, including specimen size and shape as well as notch configuration and depth, influence the test results.
Both plane strain fracture toughness and these impact tests have been used to 
determine the fracture properties of materials. The former are quantitative in nature, in that a specific property of the material is determined (i.e., K
Ic). The results of the impact 
tests, however, are more qualitative and are of little use for design purposes. Impact energies are of interest mainly in a relative sense and for making comparisons—absolute values are of little significance. Attempts have been made to correlate plane strain fracture toughnesses and CVN energies, with only limited success. Plane strain fracture toughness tests are not as simple to perform as impact tests; furthermore, equipment and specimens are more expensive.
Ductile-to-Brittle Transition
One of the primary functions of the Charpy and the Izod tests is to determine whether a material experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition with decreasing temperature and, 
if so, the range of temperatures over which it occurs. As may be noted in the chapter-
opening photograph of the fractured oil tanker for this chapter (also the transport ship shown in Figure 1.3), widely used steels can exhibit this ductile-to-brittle  transition Charpy, Izod tests

with disastrous consequences. The ductile-to-brittle transition is related to the tem-
perature dependence of the measured impact energy absorption. This transition is represented for a steel by curve A  in Figure 8.14. At higher temperatures, the CVN 
energy is relatively large, corresponding to a ductile mode of fracture. As the tempera-ture is lowered, the impact energy drops suddenly over a relatively narrow tempera-ture range, below which the energy has a constant but small value—that is, the mode of fracture is brittle.Tutorial Video:

Alternatively, appearance of the failure surface is indicative of the nature of frac-
ture and may be used in transition temperature determinations. For ductile fracture, 
this surface appears fibrous or dull (or of shear character), as in the steel specimen 
of Figure 8.15, which was tested at 79 °C. Conversely, totally brittle surfaces have a 
granular (shiny) texture (or cleavage character) (the −59°C specimen in Figure 8.15). 
Over the ductile-to-brittle transition, features of both types will exist (in Figure 8.15, displayed by specimens tested at −12°C, 4°C, 16°C, and 24°C). Frequently, the percent 
shear fracture is plotted as a function of temperature—curve B in Figure 8.14.
For many alloys there is a range of temperatures over which the ductile-to-brittle 
transition occurs (Figure 8.14); this presents some difficulty in specifying a single ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. No explicit criterion has been established, and so this temperature is often defined as the temperature at which the CVN energy assumes some value (e.g., 20 J or 15 ft-lb
f), or corresponding to some given fracture appearance 
(e.g., 50% fibrous fracture). Matters are further complicated by the fact that a  different transition temperature may be realized for each of these criteria. Perhaps the most conservative transition temperature is that at which the fracture surface becomes 100% fibrous; on this basis, the transition temperature is approximately 110 °C (230°F) for the 
steel alloy that is the subject of Figure 8.14.Figure 8.14  Temperature

228  •   Chapter 8  /  Failure
Structures constructed from alloys that exhibit this ductile-to-brittle behavior 
should be used only at temperatures above the transition temperature to avoid brittle 
and catastrophic failure. Classic examples of this type of failure were discussed in the case study found in Chapter 1. During World War II, a number of welded transport ships away from combat suddenly split in half. The vessels were constructed of a steel al-loy that possessed adequate toughness according to room-temperature tensile tests. The brittle fractures occurred at relatively low ambient temperatures, at about 4 °C (40°F), 
in the vicinity of the transition temperature of the alloy. Each fracture crack originated at some point of stress concentration, probably a sharp corner or fabrication defect, and then propagated around the entire girth of the ship.
In addition to the ductile-to-brittle transition represented in Figure 8.14, two other 
general types of impact energy–versus–temperature behavior have been observed; these are represented schematically by the upper and lower curves of Figure 8.16. Here it may be noted that low-strength FCC metals (some aluminum and copper alloys) and most HCP metals do not experience a ductile-to-brittle transition (corresponding to the upper curve of Figure 8.16) and retain high impact energies (i.e., remain tough) with decreasing tempera-ture. For high-strength materials (e.g., high-strength steels and titanium alloys), the impact energy is also relatively insensitive to temperature (the lower curve of Figure 8.16); however, these materials are also very brittle, as reflected by their low impact energies. The character-istic ductile-to-brittle transition is represented by the middle curve of Figure 8.16. As noted, this behavior is typically found in low-strength steels that have the BCC crystal structure.
For these low-strength steels, the transition temperature is sensitive to both alloy 
composition and microstructure. For example, decreasing the average grain size results in a lowering of the transition temperature. Hence, refining the grain size both strengthens (Section 7.8) and toughens steels. In contrast, increasing the carbon content, although it increases the strength of steels, also raises their CVN transition, as indicated in Figure 8.17.
Most ceramics and polymers also experience a ductile-to-brittle transition. For 
 ceramic materials, the transition occurs only at elevated temperatures, ordinarily in ex-cess of 1000 °C (1850° F). This behavior as related to polymers is discussed in Section 15.6.Impact energyLow-strength (FCC and HCP) metals

8.7 Cyclic Stresses  •   229
Fatigue is a form of failure that occurs in structures subjected to dynamic and fluctuating 
stresses (e.g., bridges, aircraft, machine components). Under these circumstances, it is possible for failure to occur at a stress level considerably lower than the tensile or yield strength for a static load. The term fatigue is used because this type of failure normally occurs after a lengthy period of repeated stress or strain cycling. Fatigue is important inasmuch as it is the single largest cause of failure in metals, estimated to be involved in approximately 90% of all metallic failures; polymers and ceramics (except for glasses) are also susceptible to this type of failure. Furthermore, fatigue is catastrophic and  insidious, occurring very suddenly and without warning.
Fatigue failure is brittle-like in nature even in normally ductile metals in that there 
is very little, if any, gross plastic deformation associated with failure. The process occurs by the initiation and propagation of cracks, and typically the fracture surface is perpendicular to the direction of an applied tensile stress.fatigueFatigue
8.7 CYCLIC STRESSES
The applied stress may be axial (tension–compression), flexural (bending), or torsional (twisting) in nature. In general, three different fluctuating stress–time modes are possible. One is represented schematically by a regular and sinusoidal time dependence in Figure 8.18a , where the amplitude is symmetrical about a mean 
zero stress level, for example, alternating from a maximum tensile stress ( 𝜎
max) to 
a minimum compressive stress ( 𝜎min) of equal magnitude; this is referred to as a 
reversed stress cycle. Another type, termed a repeated stress cycle, is illustrated in Figure 8.18b ; the maxima and minima are asymmetrical relative to the zero stress 
level. Finally, the stress level may vary randomly in amplitude and frequency, as exemplified in Figure 8.18c .
Also indicated in Figure 8.18 b are several parameters used to characterize the fluc-
tuating stress cycle. The stress amplitude alternates about a mean stress 𝜎
m, defined as 
the average of the maximum and minimum stresses in the cycle, or
 𝜎m=𝜎max+𝜎min
2 (8.11)
The range of stress 𝜎r is the difference between 𝜎max and 𝜎min, namely,
 𝜎r=𝜎max−𝜎min (8.12)
Stress amplitude 𝜎a is one-half of this range of stress, or
 𝜎a=𝜎r
2=𝜎max−𝜎min
2 (8.13)
Finally, the stress ratio R is the ratio of minimum and maximum stress amplitudes:

8.8 The S–N Curve  •   231
As with other mechanical characteristics, the fatigue properties of materials can be deter-
mined from laboratory simulation tests.9 A test apparatus should be designed to duplicate 
as nearly as possible the service stress conditions (stress level, time frequency, stress pattern, etc.). The most common type of test conducted in a laboratory setting employs a rotating–bending beam: alternating tension and compression stresses of equal magnitude are im-posed on the specimen as it is simultaneously bent and rotated. In this case, the stress cycle is reversed—that is, R  = −1. Schematic diagrams of the apparatus and test specimen commonly 
used for this type of fatigue testing are shown in Figures 8.19a  and 8.19b , respectively. From 
Figure 8.19a, during rotation, the lower surface of the specimen is subjected to a tensile (i.e., 
positive) stress, whereas the upper surface experiences compression (i.e., negative) stress.
Furthermore, anticipated in-service conditions may call for conducting simulated 
laboratory fatigue tests that use either uniaxial tension–compression or torsional stress cycling instead of rotating–bending.
A series of tests is commenced by subjecting a specimen to stress cycling at a 
 relatively large maximum stress ( 𝜎
max), usually on the order of two-thirds of the static 
tensile strength; number of cycles to failure is counted and recorded. This procedure is repeated on other specimens at progressively decreasing maximum stress levels. Data are plotted as stress S versus the logarithm of the number N of cycles to failure for each 
of the specimens. The S parameter is normally taken as either maximum stress ( 𝜎
max) or 
stress amplitude ( 𝜎a) (Figures 8.18a and b).
Two distinct types of S–N behavior are observed and are represented schematically in 
Figure 8.20. As these plots indicate, the higher the magnitude of the stress, the smaller the number of cycles the material is capable of sustaining before failure. For some  ferrous (iron-base) and titanium alloys, the S–N curve (Figure 8.20a ) becomes  horizontal at higher 
N values; there is a limiting stress level, called the fatigue limit (also sometimes called the 
endurance limit), below which fatigue failure will not occur. This fatigue limit represents the 
fatigue limit

largest value of fluctuating stress that will not cause failure for essentially an infinite number 
of cycles. For many steels, fatigue limits range between 35% and 60% of the tensile strength.
Most nonferrous alloys (e.g., aluminum, copper) do not have a fatigue limit, in that 
the S–N curve continues its downward trend at increasingly greater N  values (Figure 
8.20b ). Thus, fatigue ultimately occurs regardless of the magnitude of the stress. For 
these materials, the fatigue response is specified as fatigue strength,  which is defined as 
the stress level at which failure will occur for some specified number of cycles (e.g., 107 
cycles). The determination of fatigue strength is also demonstrated in Figure 8.20b .
Another important parameter that characterizes a material’s fatigue behavior is 
fatigue life Nf. It is the number of cycles to cause failure at a specified stress level, as 
taken from the S–N plot (Figure 8.20b).
Fatigue S–N curves for several metal alloys are shown in Figure 8.21; data were gen-
erated using rotating–bending tests with reversed stress cycles (i.e., R = −1). Curves for 
the titanium, magnesium, and steel alloys as well as for cast iron display fatigue limits; curves for the brass and aluminum alloys do not have such limits.
Unfortunately, there always exists considerable scatter in fatigue data—that is, a vari-
ation in the measured N  value for a number of specimens tested at the same stress level. 
This variation may lead to significant design uncertainties when fatigue life and/or fatigue fatigue strength

limit (or strength) are being considered. The scatter in results is a consequence of the fa-
tigue sensitivity to a number of test and material parameters that are impossible to control precisely. These parameters include specimen fabrication and surface preparation, metal-lurgical variables, specimen alignment in the apparatus, mean stress, and test frequency.
Fatigue S–N curves shown in Figure 8.21 represent “best-fit” curves that have been 
drawn through average-value data points. It is a little unsettling to realize that approxi-mately one-half of the specimens tested actually failed at stress levels lying nearly 25% below the curve (as determined on the basis of statistical treatments).
Several statistical techniques have been developed to specify fatigue life and fatigue 
limit in terms of probabilities. One convenient way of representing data treated in this manner is with a series of constant probability curves, several of which are plotted in Figure 8.22. The P value associated with each curve represents the probability of failure. 0100

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 8.2
Maximum Load Computation to Avert Fatigue for Rotating–Bending Tests
A cylindrical bar of 1045 steel having the S–N behavior shown in Figure 8.21 is subjected to 
rotating–bending tests with reversed-stress cycles (per Figure 8.19). If the bar diameter is 15.0 mm, determine the maximum cyclic load that may be applied to ensure that fatigue failure will not occur. Assume a factor of safety of 2.0 and that the distance between load-bearing points is 60.0 mm (0.0600 m).
Solution
From Figure 8.21, the 1045 steel has a fatigue limit (maximum stress) of magnitude 310 MPa. 
For a cylindrical bar of diameter d
0 (Figure 8.19b), maximum stress for rotating–bending tests 
may be determined using the following expression:
 𝜎=16FL
𝜋d3
0 (8.15)
Here, L is equal to the distance between the two load-bearing points (Figure 8.19 b), 𝜎 is the 
maximum stress (in our case the fatigue limit), and F is the maximum applied load. When 𝜎 is 
divided by the factor of safety (N), Equation 8.15 takes the form
 𝜎
N=16FL
𝜋d30 (8.16)
and solving for F leads to
 F=𝜎𝜋d30
16NL (8.17)
Incorporating values for d0, L, and N provided in the problem statement as well as the fatigue 
limit taken from Figure 8.21 (310 MPa, or 310 × 106 N/m2) yields the following:
 F=(310 ×106 N/m2)(𝜋)(15 ×10−3 m)3
(16)(2)(0.0600 m)
   =1712 N
Therefore, for cyclic reversed and rotating–bending, a maximum load of 1712 N may be applied 
without causing the 1045 steel bar to fail by fatigue.For example, at a stress of 200 MPa (30,000 psi), we would expect 1% of the specimens to fail at about 10
6 cycles, 50% to fail at about 2 × 107 cycles, and so on. Remember 
that S–N curves represented in the literature are normally average values, unless noted 
otherwise.
The fatigue behaviors represented in Figures 8.20 a and 8.20b may be classified into 
two domains. One is associated with relatively high loads that produce not only elastic strain but also some plastic strain during each cycle. Consequently, fatigue lives are relatively short; this domain is termed low-cycle fatigue and occurs at less than about 
10
4 to 105 cycles. For lower stress levels wherein deformations are totally elastic, longer 
lives result. This is called high-cycle fatigue because relatively large numbers of cycles 
are required to produce fatigue failure. High-cycle fatigue is associated with fatigue lives greater than about 10
4 to 105 cycles.

Lifetime for Tension-Compression Tests
A cylindrical 70Cu-30Zn brass bar (Figure 8.21) is subjected to axial tension–compression 
stress testing with reversed-cycling. If the load amplitude is 10,000 N, compute the minimum allowable bar diameter to ensure that fatigue failure will not occur at 10
7 cycles. Assume a fac-
tor of safety of 2.5, data in Figure 8.21 were taken for reversed axial tension–compression tests, and that S is stress amplitude.
Solution
From Figure 8.21, the fatigue strength for this alloy at 10
7 cycles is 115 MPa (115 × 106 N/m2). 
Tensile and compressive stresses are defined in Equation 6.1 as
 𝜎=F
A0 (6.1)
Here, F is the applied load and A0 is the cross-sectional area. For a cylindrical bar having a 
diameter of d0,
A0=𝜋(d0

Substitution of this expression for A0 into Equation 6.1 leads to
 𝜎=F
A0=F

We now solve for d0, replacing stress with the fatigue strength divided by the factor of safety 
(i.e., 𝜎/N). Thus,

Incorporating values of F, N, and 𝜎 cited previously leads to

  =16.6 ×10−3 m=16.6 mm
Hence, the brass bar diameter must be at least 16.6 mm to ensure that fatigue failure will not occur.EXAMPLE PROBLEM 8.3
The process of fatigue failure is characterized by three distinct steps: (1) crack initiation, 
in which a small crack forms at some point of high stress concentration; (2) crack propa-gation, during which this crack advances incrementally with each stress cycle; and (3) final failure, which occurs very rapidly once the advancing crack has reached a critical size. Cracks associated with fatigue failure almost always initiate (or nucleate) on the

include surface scratches, sharp fillets, keyways, threads, dents, and the like. In addition, cyclic loading can produce microscopic surface discontinuities resulting from dislocation slip steps that may also act as stress raisers and therefore as crack initiation sites.
The region of a fracture surface that formed during the crack propagation step may 
be characterized by two types of markings termed beachmarks  and striations . Both fea-
tures indicate the position of the crack tip at some point in time and appear as concentric ridges that expand away from the crack initiation site(s), frequently in a circular or semi-circular pattern. Beachmarks (sometimes also called clamshell marks ) are of macroscopic 
dimensions (Figure 8.23), and may be observed with the unaided eye. These markings are found for components that experienced interruptions during the crack propagation stage—for example, a machine that operated only during normal workshift hours. Each beachmark band represents a period of time over which crack growth occurred.
However, fatigue striations are microscopic in size and subject to observation with the 
electron microscope (either TEM or SEM). Figure 8.24 is an electron fractograph that shows this feature. Each striation is thought to represent the advance distance of a crack front dur-ing a single load cycle. Striation width depends on, and increases with, increasing stress range.
During the propagation of fatigue cracks and on a microscopic scale, there is very lo-
calized plastic deformation at crack tips, even though the maximum applied stress to which the object is exposed in each stress cycle lies below the yield strength of the metal. This applied stress is amplified at crack tips to the degree that local stress levels exceed the yield strength. The geometry of fatigue striations is a manifestation of this plastic deformation.
11
It should be emphasized that although both beachmarks and striations are fatigue 
fracture surface features having similar appearances, they are nevertheless different in both origin and size. There may be thousands of striations within a single beachmark.Tutorial Video:

12The case study on the automobile valve spring in Sections M.7 and M.8 of the Mechanical Engineering (ME) 
Online Module relates to the discussion of this section. [The ME Online Module may be found in all digital versions 
of this text or at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site)].Often the cause of failure may be deduced after examination of the failure  surfaces. 
The presence of beachmarks and/or striations on a fracture surface confirms that the 
cause of failure was fatigue. Nevertheless, the absence of either or both does not ex-clude fatigue failure. Striations are not observed for all metals that experience fatigue. Furthermore, the likelihood of the appearance of striations may depend on stress state. Striation detectability decreases with the passage of time because of the formation of surface corrosion products and/or oxide films. Also, during stress cycling, striations may be destroyed by abrasive action as crack mating surfaces rub against one another.
One final comment regarding fatigue failure surfaces: Beachmarks and striations do 
not appear on the region over which the rapid failure occurs. Rather, the rapid failure may be either ductile or brittle; evidence of plastic deformation will be present for ductile failure and absent for brittle failure. This region of failure may be noted in Figure 8.25.Figure 8.25  Fatigue failure surface. A crack formed 
at the top edge. The smooth region also near the top 
corresponds to the area over which the crack propagated slowly. Rapid failure  occurred over the area having a dull and  fibrous texture (the largest area). Approximately 0.5×.

8.10 FACTORS THAT AFFECT FATIGUE LIFE12

sensitive to a number of variables, including mean stress level, geometric design, surface effects, and metallurgical variables, as well as the environment. This section is devoted Concept Check 8.4 Surfaces for some steel specimens that have failed by fatigue have a

to a discussion of these factors and to measures that may be taken to improve the fatigue 
resistance of structural components.
Mean Stress
The dependence of fatigue life on stress amplitude is represented on the S–N plot. Such data are taken for a constant mean stress 𝜎
m, often for the reversed cycle situation ( 𝜎m = 0). 
Mean stress, however, also affects fatigue life; this influence may be represented by a  series of S–N curves, each measured at a different 𝜎
m, as depicted schematically in Figure 8.26. As 
may be noted, increasing the mean stress level leads to a decrease in fatigue life.
Surface Effects
For many common loading situations, the maximum stress within a component or  structure occurs at its surface. Consequently, most cracks leading to fatigue failure  originate at surface positions, specifically at stress amplification sites. Therefore, it has been  observed that fatigue life is especially sensitive to the condition and configuration of the component surface. Numerous factors influence fatigue resistance, the proper management of which will lead to an improvement in fatigue life. These include design criteria as well as various surface treatments.
Design Factors
The design of a component can have a significant influence on its fatigue character-
istics. Any notch or geometrical discontinuity can act as a stress raiser and fatigue crack initiation site; these design features include grooves, holes, keyways, threads, and so on. The sharper the discontinuity (i.e., the smaller the radius of curvature), the more severe the stress concentration. The probability of fatigue failure may be reduced by avoiding (when possible) these structural irregularities or by making design modifications by which sudden contour changes leading to sharp corners are eliminated—for example, calling for rounded fillets with large radii of curvature at the point where there is a change in diameter for a rotating shaft (Figure 8.27).
Surface Treatments
During machining operations, small scratches and grooves are invariably intro-
duced into the workpiece surface by cutting-tool action. These surface markings can limit the fatigue life. It has been observed that improving the surface finish by polishing enhances fatigue life significantly.
One of the most effective methods of increasing fatigue performance is by imposing 
residual compressive stresses within a thin outer surface layer. Thus, a surface tensile

stress of external origin is partially nullified and reduced in magnitude by the residual 
compressive stress. The net effect is that the likelihood of crack formation and therefore of fatigue failure is reduced.
Residual compressive stresses are commonly introduced into ductile metals mechan-
ically by localized plastic deformation within the outer surface region. Commercially, this is often accomplished by a process termed shot peening. Small, hard particles (shot) having diameters within the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mm are projected at high velocities onto the surface to be treated. The resulting deformation induces compressive stresses to a depth of between one-quarter and one-half of the shot diameter. The influence of shot peening on the fatigue behavior of steel is demonstrated schematically in Figure 8.28.
Case hardening is a technique by which both surface hardness and fatigue life are 
enhanced for steel alloys. This is accomplished by a carburizing or nitriding process by which a component is exposed to a carbonaceous or nitrogenous atmosphere at elevated temperature. A carbon- or nitrogen-rich outer surface layer (or case) is introduced by atomic diffusion from the gaseous phase. The case is normally on the order of 1 mm deep and is harder than the inner core of material. (The influence of carbon content on hard-ness for Fe–C alloys is demonstrated in Figure 10.30 a.) The improvement of fatigue prop-
erties results from increased hardness within the case, as well as from the desired residual compressive stresses, the formation of which attends the carburizing or nitriding process. A carbon-rich outer case may be observed for the gear shown in the top chapter-opening photograph for Chapter 5; it appears as a dark outer rim within the sectioned segment. The increase in case hardness is demonstrated in the photomicrograph in Figure 8.29. The dark and elongated diamond shapes are Knoop microhardness indentations. The upper indentation, lying within the carburized layer, is smaller than the core indentation.

8.11 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
Environmental factors may also affect the fatigue behavior of materials. A few brief 
comments will be given relative to two types of environment-assisted fatigue failure: thermal fatigue and corrosion fatigue.
240  •   Chapter 8  /  Failure
Thermal fatigue is normally induced at elevated temperatures by fluctuating ther-
mal stresses; mechanical stresses from an external source need not be present. The 
origin of these thermal stresses is the restraint to the dimensional expansion and/or con-traction that would normally occur in a structural member with variations in tempera-ture. The magnitude of a thermal stress developed by a temperature change ΔT depends on the coefficient of thermal expansion 𝛼
l and the modulus of elasticity E according to
 𝜎=𝛼lEΔT (8.20)
(The topics of thermal expansion and thermal stresses are discussed in Sections 19.3 and 19.5.) Thermal stresses do not arise if this mechanical restraint is absent. Therefore, one obvious way to prevent this type of fatigue is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the restraint source, thus allowing unhindered dimensional changes with temperature vari-ations, or to choose materials with appropriate physical properties.
Failure that occurs by the simultaneous action of a cyclic stress and chemical attack is 
termed corrosion fatigue. Corrosive environments have a deleterious influence and pro-
duce shorter fatigue lives. Even normal ambient atmosphere affects the fatigue behavior of some materials. Small pits may form as a result of chemical reactions between the envi-ronment and the material, which may serve as points of stress concentration and therefore as crack nucleation sites. In addition, the crack propagation rate is enhanced as a result of the corrosive environment. The nature of the stress cycles influences the fatigue behavior; for example, lowering the load application frequency leads to longer periods during which the opened crack is in contact with the environment and to a reduction in the fatigue life.
Several approaches to corrosion fatigue prevention exist. On one hand, we can take 
measures to reduce the rate of corrosion by some of the techniques discussed in Chapter 17—for example, apply protective surface coatings, select a more corrosion-resistant material, and reduce the corrosiveness of the environment. On the other hand, it might be advisable to take actions to minimize the probability of normal fatigue failure, as outlined previously—for example, reduce the applied tensile stress level and impose residual compressive stresses on the surface of the member.thermal fatigue

Creep
Materials are often placed in service at elevated temperatures and exposed to static 
mechanical stresses (e.g., turbine rotors in jet engines and steam generators that experi-ence centrifugal stresses; high-pressure steam lines). Deformation under such circum-stances is termed creep. Defined as the time-dependent and permanent deformation of 
materials when subjected to a constant load or stress, creep is normally an undesirable phenomenon and is often the limiting factor in the lifetime of a part. It is observed in all materials types; for metals, it becomes important only for temperatures greater than about 0.4T
m, where Tm is the absolute melting temperature. Amorphous polymers, 
which include plastics and rubbers, are especially sensitive to creep deformation, as discussed in Section 15.4.creep
8.12 GENERALIZED CREEP BEHAVIOR
A typical creep test13 consists of subjecting a specimen to a constant load or stress 
while maintaining the temperature constant; deformation or strain is measured and plotted as a function of elapsed time. Most tests are the constant-load type, which yield 
13ASTM Standard E139, “Standard Test Methods for Conducting Creep, Creep-Rupture, and Stress-Rupture Tests 
of Metallic Materials.”
8.13 Stress and Temperature Effects  •   241
 information of an engineering nature; constant-stress tests are employed to provide a 
better understanding of the mechanisms of creep.
Figure 8.30 is a schematic representation of the typical constant-load creep behavior 
of metals. Upon application of the load, there is an instantaneous deformation, as in-dicated in the figure, that is totally elastic. The resulting creep curve consists of three regions, each of which has its own distinctive strain–time feature. Primary or transient 
creep occurs first, typified by a continuously decreasing creep rate—that is, the slope of the curve decreases with time. This suggests that the material is experiencing an increase in creep resistance or strain hardening (Section 7.10)—deformation becomes more dif-ficult as the material is strained. For secondary creep, sometimes termed steady-state 
creep, the rate is constant—that is, the plot becomes linear. This is often the stage of creep that is of the longest duration. The constancy of creep rate is explained on the basis of a balance between the competing processes of strain hardening and recovery, recovery (Section 7.11) being the process by which a material becomes softer and retains its ability to experience deformation. Finally, for tertiary creep, there is an acceleration 
of the rate and ultimate failure. This failure is frequently termed rupture and results 
from microstructural and/or metallurgical changes—for example, grain boundary sepa-ration, and the formation of internal cracks, cavities, and voids. Also, for tensile loads, a neck may form at some point within the deformation region. These all lead to a decrease in the effective cross-sectional area and an increase in strain rate.
For metallic materials, most creep tests are conducted in uniaxial tension using a 
specimen having the same geometry as for tensile tests (Figure 6.2). However, uniaxial compression tests are more appropriate for brittle materials; these provide a better measure of the intrinsic creep properties because there is no stress amplification and crack propagation, as with tensile loads. Compressive test specimens are usually right cylinders or parallelepipeds having length-to-diameter ratios ranging from about 2 to 4. For most materials, creep properties are virtually independent of loading direction.
Possibly the most important parameter from a creep test is the slope of the second-
ary portion of the creep curve ( Δ𝜀/Δt in Figure 8.30); this is often called the minimum 
or steady-state creep rate 𝜀⋅
s. It is the engineering design parameter that is considered 
for long-life applications, such as a nuclear power plant component that is scheduled to operate for several decades, and when failure or too much strain is not an option. However, for many relatively short-life creep situations (e.g., turbine blades in mili-tary aircraft and rocket motor nozzles), time to rupture, or the rupture lifetime t
r, is the 
dominant design consideration; it is also indicated in Figure 8.30. Of course, for its determination, creep tests must be conducted to the point of failure; these are termed creep rupture tests. Thus, knowledge of these creep characteristics of a material allows the design engineer to ascertain its suitability for a specific application.Tutorial Video:

8.13 STRESS AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS
Both temperature and the level of the applied stress influence the creep characteristics 
(Figure 8.31). At a temperature substantially below 0.4Tm, and after the initial deformation, 
the strain is virtually independent of time. With either increasing stress or temperature, the following will be noted: (1) the instantaneous strain at the time of stress application increases, (2) the steady-state creep rate increases, and (3) the rupture lifetime decreases.

Inasmuch as temperate is constant (260 °C), Equation 8.21 may be used to solve this problem. 
A more useful form of this equation results by taking natural logarithms of both sides as
 ln  𝜀⋅
s=ln  K1+n ln  𝜎 (8.23)
The problem statement provides us with two values of both 𝜀⋅
s and 𝜎; thus, we can solve for K1 
and n from two independent equations, and using values for these two parameters it is possible 
to determine 𝜀⋅
s at a stress of 10 MPa.
 Incorporating the two sets of data into Equation 8.23 leads to the following two independent 
expressions:

If we subtract the second equation from the first, the ln  K1 terms drop out, which 
yields the following:
ln(2.0 ×10−4 h−1)−ln(3.65 h−1)=(n)[ln(3 MPa) −ln(25 MPa) ]
And solving for n,
n=ln(2.0 ×10−4 h−1)−ln(3.65 h−1)
[ln(3 MPa) −ln(25 MPa) ]=4.63
It is now possible to calculate K1 by substitution of this value of n into either of the 
preceding equations. Using the first one,
  ln  K1=ln(2.0 ×10−4 h−1)−(4.63)ln(3 MPa)

Therefore,
K1=exp( −13.60) =1.24 ×10−6
And, finally, we solve for 𝜀⋅

K1 into Equation 8.21:
 𝜀˙s=K1𝜎n=(1.24 ×10−6)(10 MPa)4.63
 =5.3×10−2 h−1
Several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the creep behavior for 
various materials; these mechanisms involve stress-induced vacancy diffusion, grain bound-
ary diffusion, dislocation motion, and grain boundary sliding. Each leads to a  different value of the stress exponent n  in Equations 8.21 and 8.22. It has been possible to elucidate the 
creep mechanism for a particular material by comparing its experimental n  value with values 
predicted for the various mechanisms. In addition, correlations have been made between the activation energy for creep (Q
c) and the activation energy for diffusion (Qd, Equation 5.8).
Creep data of this nature are represented pictorially for some well-studied systems 
in the form of stress–temperature diagrams, which are termed deformation mechanism 
maps. These maps indicate stress–temperature regimes (or areas) over which various mechanisms operate. Constant-strain-rate contours are often also included. Thus, for some creep situation, given the appropriate deformation mechanism map and any two of the three parameters—temperature, stress level, and creep strain rate—the third pa-rameter may be determined.Tutorial Video:

8.14 DATA EXTRAPOLATION METHODS
The need often arises for engineering creep data that are impractical to collect from normal laboratory tests. This is especially true for prolonged exposures (on the  order of years). One solution to this problem involves performing creep and/or creep  rupture tests at temperatures in excess of those required, for shorter time periods, and at a  comparable stress level, and then making a suitable extrapolation to the in-service  condition. A com-monly used extrapolation procedure employs the Larson–Miller  parameter, m, defined as
 
m=T(C+log tr)  (8.24)The Larson–Miller 
parameter—in terms of temperature and rupture lifetime

where C is a constant (usually on the order of 20), for T in Kelvin and the rupture lifetime 
tr in hours. The rupture lifetime of a given material measured at some specific stress level 
varies with temperature such that this parameter remains constant. Alternatively, the data 
may be plotted as the logarithm of stress versus the Larson–Miller parameter, as shown in Figure 8.34. Use of this technique is demonstrated in the following design example.

results in higher creep rates. This effect may be contrasted to the influence of grain size 
on the mechanical behavior at low temperatures [i.e., increase in both strength (Section 7.8) and toughness (Section 8.6)].
Stainless steels (Section 11.2) and the superalloys (Section 11.3) are especially resil-
ient to creep and are commonly employed in high-temperature service applications. The creep resistance of the superalloys is enhanced by solid-solution alloying and also by the formation of precipitate phases. In addition, advanced processing techniques have been utilized; one such technique is directional solidification, which produces either highly elongated grains or single-crystal components (Figure 8.35).

SUMMARY
• The three usual causes of failure are
Improper materials selection and processing
Inadequate component designComponent misuse
• Fracture in response to tensile loading and at relatively low temperatures may occur 
by ductile and brittle modes.
• Ductile fracture is normally preferred because
Preventive measures may be taken inasmuch as evidence of plastic deformation 
indicates that fracture is imminent.
More energy is required to induce ductile fracture than for brittle fracture.
• Cracks in ductile materials are said to be stable (i.e., resist extension without an 
 increase in applied stress).
• For brittle materials, cracks are unstable —that is, crack propagation, once started, 
continues spontaneously without an increase in stress level.
• For ductile metals, two tensile fracture profiles are possible:
Necking down to a point fracture when ductility is high (Figure 8.1a)Only moderate necking with a cup-and-cone fracture profile (Figure 8.1 b) when 
the material is less ductile
• For brittle fracture, the fracture surface is relatively flat and perpendicular to the 
 direction of the applied tensile load (Figure 8.1c).
• Transgranular (through-grain) and intergranular (between-grain) crack propagation paths are possible for polycrystalline brittle materials.Introduction

Summary  •   247
• The significant discrepancy between actual and theoretical fracture strengths of brittle 
materials is explained by the existence of small flaws that are capable of amplifying an 
applied tensile stress in their vicinity, leading ultimately to crack formation. Fracture ensues when the theoretical cohesive strength is exceeded at the tip of one of these flaws.
• Sharp corners may also act as points of stress concentration and should be avoided 
when designing structures that are subjected to stresses.
• The fracture toughness of a material is indicative of its resistance to brittle fracture 
when a crack is present. 
• K
Ic is the parameter normally cited for design purposes; its value is relatively large for 
ductile materials (and small for brittle ones) and is a function of microstructure, strain rate, and temperature.
• With regard to designing against the possibility of fracture, consideration must be given 
to material (its fracture toughness), the stress level, and the flaw size  detection limit.
• Three factors that may cause a metal to experience a ductile-to-brittle transition are exposure 
to stresses at relatively low temperatures, high strain rates, and the presence of a sharp notch.
• Qualitatively, the fracture behavior of materials may be determined using the Charpy 
and the Izod impact testing techniques (Figure 8.13).
• On the basis of the temperature dependence of measured impact energy (or the 
 appearance of the fracture surface), it is possible to ascertain whether a material experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition and, if it does, the temperature range over which such a transition occurs.
• Low-strength steel alloys typify this ductile-to-brittle behavior and, for structural 
 applications, should be used at temperatures in excess of the transition range.
• For low-strength steel alloys, the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature may be 
lowered by decreasing grain size and lowering the carbon content.
• Fatigue is a common type of catastrophic failure in which the applied stress level fluc-
tuates with time; it occurs when the maximum stress level may be considerably lower than the static tensile or yield strength.
• Fluctuating stresses are categorized into three general stress-versus-time cycle modes: 
reversed, repeated, and random (Figure 8.18). Reversed and repeated modes are characterized in terms of mean stress, range of stress, and stress amplitude.
• Test data are plotted as stress (normally, stress amplitude) versus the logarithm of the 
number of cycles to failure.
• Two distinctive types to fatigue S–N behavior are displayed by metal alloys:
For many alloys, stress decreases continuously with increasing number of cycles 
at failure (Figure 8.20b); fatigue behavior of these materials is characterized by fatigue strength and fatigue life.
For other alloys, at some point on the S–N curve, stress ceases to decrease with, 
and becomes independent of, the number of cycles (Figure 8.20 a); this stress 
level is the fatigue limit.
• Fatigue cracks normally nucleate on the surface of a component at some point of 
stress concentration.
• Two characteristic fatigue surface features are beachmarks and striations.
• Measures that may be taken to extend fatigue life include the following:
Reducing the mean stress level
Eliminating sharp surface discontinuitiesImproving the surface finish by polishingImposing surface residual compressive stresses by shot peeningCase hardening by using a carburizing or nitriding processPrinciples of Fracture

• Thermal stresses may be induced in components that are exposed to elevated tem-
perature fluctuations and when thermal expansion and/or contraction is restrained; 
fatigue for these conditions is termed thermal fatigue.
• The presence of a chemically active environment may lead to a reduction in fatigue 
life for corrosion fatigue. 
• The time-dependent plastic deformation of metals subjected to a constant load (or 
stress) and at temperatures greater than about 0.4 Tm is termed creep.
• A typical creep curve (strain versus time) normally exhibits three distinct regions 
(Figure 8.30): transient (or primary), steady-state (or secondary), and tertiary.
• Important design parameters available from such a plot include the steady-state creep 
rate (slope of the linear region) and rupture lifetime (Figure 8.30).
• Both temperature and applied stress level influence creep behavior. Increasing either 
of these parameters produces the following effects:
An increase in the instantaneous initial deformationAn increase in the steady-state creep rateA decrease in the rupture lifetime
• An analytical expression was presented that relates 𝜀⋅
s to both temperature and 
stress—see Equation 8.22.
• Extrapolation of creep test data to lower-temperature/longer-time regimes is possible 
using a plot of logarithm of stress versus the Larson–Miller parameter for the particular alloy (Figure 8.34).

pressure (vertical axis, scaled logarithmically) versus temperature. In a sense this diagram is a map 
in which regions for the three familiar phases—solid (ice), liquid (water), and vapor (steam)—are  delineated. The three red curves represent phase boundaries that define the regions. A photograph located in each region shows an example of its phase—ice cubes, liquid water being poured into a glass, and steam spewing from a kettle.

The understanding of phase diagrams for alloy systems is extremely important because 
there is a strong correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties, and the development of microstructure of an alloy is related to the characteristics of its phase diagram. In addition, phase diagrams provide valuable information about melting, cast-ing, crystallization, and other phenomena.
This chapter presents and discusses the following topics: (1) terminology associated 
with phase diagrams and phase transformations; (2) pressure–temperature phase diagrams for pure materials; (3) the interpretation of phase diagrams; (4) some of the common and relatively simple binary phase diagrams, including that for the iron–carbon system; and (5) the development of equilibrium microstructures upon cooling for several situations.9.1 INTRODUCTION
Definitions and Basic Concepts
It is necessary to establish a foundation of definitions and basic concepts relating to alloys, phases, and equilibrium before delving into the interpretation and utiliza-tion of phase diagrams. The term component is frequently used in this discussion; 
components are pure metals and/or compounds of which an alloy is composed. For 
example, in a copper–zinc brass, the components are Cu and Zn. Solute and solvent,  componentOne reason that a knowledge and understanding 
of phase diagrams is important to the engineer relates to the design and control of heat-treating procedures; some properties of materials are functions of their microstructures and, consequently, of their thermal histories. Even though most phase diagrams represent stable (or equilibrium) states and microstructures, they are nevertheless useful in understanding the development and preservation of nonequilibrium structures and their attendant properties; it is often the case that these properties are more desirable than those associated with the equi-librium state. This is aptly  illustrated by the phenom-
enon of precipitation  hardening (Section 11.10).
9.2 Solubility Limit  •   253
which are also common terms, were defined in Section 4.3. Another term used in 
this context is system, which has two meanings. System may refer to a specific body 
of material under consideration (e.g., a ladle of molten steel); or it may relate to the 
series of possible alloys consisting of the same components but without regard to alloy composition (e.g., the iron–carbon system).
The concept of a solid solution was introduced in Section 4.3. To review, a solid 
solution consists of atoms of at least two different types; the solute atoms occupy either substitutional or interstitial positions in the solvent lattice, and the crystal structure of the solvent is maintained.system
For many alloy systems and at some specific temperature, there is a maximum concen-tration of solute atoms that may dissolve in the solvent to form a solid solution; this is called a solubility limit. The addition of solute in excess of this solubility limit results in 
the formation of another solid solution or compound that has a distinctly different com-
position. To illustrate this concept, consider the sugar–water (C
12H22O11–H2O) system. 
Initially, as sugar is added to water, a sugar–water solution or syrup forms. As more sugar is introduced, the solution becomes more concentrated, until the solubility limit is reached or the solution becomes saturated with sugar. At this time, the solution is not capable of dissolving any more sugar, and further additions simply settle to the bottom of the container. Thus, the system now consists of two separate substances: a sugar–water syrup liquid solution and solid crystals of undissolved sugar.
This solubility limit of sugar in water depends on the temperature of the water and 
may be represented in graphical form on a plot of temperature along the ordinate and composition (in weight percent sugar) along the abscissa, as shown in Figure 9.1. Along the composition axis, increasing sugar concentration is from left to right, and percentage of water is read from right to left. Because only two components are involved (sugar and water), the sum of the concentrations at any composition will equal 100 wt%. The solubility limit is represented as the nearly vertical line in the figure. For compositions and temperatures to the left of the solubility line, only the syrup liquid solution exists; to the right of the line, syrup and solid sugar coexist. The solubility limit at some tempera-ture is the composition that corresponds to the intersection of the given temperature coordinate and the solubility limit line. For example, at 20 °C, the maximum solubility 
of sugar in water is 65 wt%. As Figure 9.1 indicates, the solubility limit increases slightly with rising temperature.solubility limit

254  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
Also critical to the understanding of phase diagrams is the concept of a phase. A phase may 
be defined as a homogeneous portion of a system that has uniform physical and chemical characteristics. Every pure material is considered to be a phase; so also is every solid, liquid, and gaseous solution. For example, the sugar–water syrup solution just discussed is one phase, and solid sugar is another. Each has different physical properties (one is a liquid, the other is a solid); furthermore, each is different chemically (i.e., has a different chemical composition); one is virtually pure sugar, the other is a solution of H
2O and C12H22O11. If 
more than one phase is present in a given system, each will have its own distinct properties, and a boundary separating the phases will exist, across which there will be a discontinuous and abrupt change in physical and/or chemical characteristics. When two phases are present in a system, it is not necessary that there be a difference in both physical and chemical 
properties; a disparity in one or the other set of properties is sufficient. When water and ice are present in a container, two separate phases exist; they are physically dissimilar (one is a solid, the other is a liquid) but identical in chemical makeup. Also, when a substance can exist in two or more polymorphic forms (e.g., having both FCC and BCC structures), each of these structures is a separate phase because their respective physical characteristics differ.
Sometimes, a single-phase system is termed homogeneous. Systems composed of two 
or more phases are termed mixtures or heterogeneous systems. Most metallic alloys and, for that matter, ceramic, polymeric, and composite systems are heterogeneous. Typically, the phases interact in such a way that the property combination of the multiphase system is different from, and more desirable than, either of the individual phases.phase

What Is a Phase?9.3 PHASES
The physical properties and, in particular, the mechanical behavior of a material often depend on the microstructure. Microstructure is subject to direct microscopic observa-tion using optical or electron microscopes; this is touched on in Sections 4.9 and 4.10. In metal alloys, microstructure is characterized by the number of phases present, their proportions, and the manner in which they are distributed or arranged. The microstruc-ture of an alloy depends on such variables as the alloying elements present, their con-centrations, and the heat treatment of the alloy (i.e., the temperature, the heating time at temperature, and the rate of cooling to room temperature).
The procedure of specimen preparation for microscopic examination is briefly out-
lined in Section 4.10. After appropriate polishing and etching, the different phases may be distinguished by their appearance. For example, for a two-phase alloy, one phase may ap-pear light and the other phase dark. When only a single phase or solid solution is present, the texture is uniform, except for grain boundaries that may be revealed (Figure 4.15 b).9.4 MICROSTRUCTURE
Equilibrium is another essential concept; it is best described in terms of a thermody-namic quantity called the free energy. In brief, free energy is a function of the internal 
energy of a system and also the randomness or disorder of the atoms or molecules (or 
entropy). A system is at equilibrium if its free energy is at a minimum under some speci-fied combination of temperature, pressure, and composition. In a macroscopic sense, this means that the characteristics of the system do not change with time, but persist indefinitely—that is, the system is stable. A change in temperature, pressure, and/or composition for a system in equilibrium results in an increase in the free energy and in a possible spontaneous change to another state by which the free energy is lowered.
The term phase equilibrium, often used in the context of this discussion, refers 
to equilibrium as it applies to systems in which more than one phase may exist. Phase equilibrium

equilibrium is reflected by a constancy with time in the phase characteristics of a system. 
Perhaps an example best illustrates this concept. Suppose that a sugar–water syrup is contained in a closed vessel and the solution is in contact with solid sugar at 20 °C. If the 
system is at equilibrium, the composition of the syrup is 65 wt% C
12H22O11–35 wt% H2O 
(Figure 9.1), and the amounts and compositions of the syrup and solid sugar will remain constant with time. If the temperature of the system is suddenly raised—say, to 100 °C—
this equilibrium or balance is temporarily upset and the solubility limit is increased to 80 wt% C
12H22O11 (Figure 9.1). Thus, some of the solid sugar will go into solution in the 
syrup. This will continue until the new equilibrium syrup concentration is established at the higher temperature.
This sugar–syrup example illustrates the principle of phase equilibrium using a 
liquid–solid system. In many metallurgical and materials systems of interest, phase equi-librium involves just solid phases. In this regard the state of the system is reflected in the characteristics of the microstructure, which necessarily include not only the phases present and their compositions, but, in addition, the relative phase amounts and their spatial arrangement or distribution.
Free energy considerations and diagrams similar to Figure 9.1 provide information 
about the equilibrium characteristics of a particular system, which is important, but they do not indicate the time period necessary for the attainment of a new equilibrium state. It is often the case, especially in solid systems, that a state of equilibrium is never completely achieved because the rate of approach to equilibrium is extremely slow; such a system is said to be in a nonequilibrium or metastable state. A metastable state or 
microstructure may persist indefinitely, experiencing only extremely slight and almost imperceptible changes as time progresses. Often, metastable structures are of more practical significance than equilibrium ones. For example, some steel and aluminum alloys rely for their strength on the development of metastable microstructures during carefully designed heat treatments (Sections 10.5 and 11.10).
Thus it is important to understand not only equilibrium states and structures, but 
also the speed or rate at which they are established and the factors that affect that rate. This chapter is devoted almost exclusively to equilibrium structures; the treatment of re-action rates and nonequilibrium structures is deferred to Chapter 10 and Section 11.10.
metastable
Much of the information about the control of the phase structure of a particular system is conveniently and concisely displayed in what is called a phase diagram, also often termed 
an equilibrium diagram. Three externally controllable parameters affect phase structure—
temperature, pressure, and composition—and phase diagrams are constructed when various combinations of these parameters are plotted against one another.
Perhaps the simplest and easiest type of phase diagram to understand is that for a 
one-component system, in which composition is held constant (i.e., the phase diagram is for a pure substance); this means that pressure and temperature are the variables. This one-component phase diagram (or unary phase diagram,  sometimes also called 
a pressure–temperature  [or P–T] diagram ) is represented as a two-dimensional plot of phase diagram9.6  ONE-COMPONENT (OR UNARY)

256  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
Binary Phase Diagramspressure (ordinate, or vertical axis) versus temperature (abscissa, or horizontal axis). 
Most often, the pressure axis is scaled logarithmically.
We illustrate this type of phase diagram and demonstrate its interpretation using as 
an example the one for H2O, which is shown in Figure 9.2. Regions for three different 
phases—solid, liquid, and vapor—are delineated on the plot. Each of the phases exist under equilibrium conditions over the temperature–pressure ranges of its corresponding area. The three curves shown on the plot (labeled aO, bO, and cO) are phase boundaries; at any point on one of these curves, the two phases on either side of the curve are in equilibrium (or coexist) with one another. Equilibrium between solid and vapor phases is along curve aO; it is likewise for the solid–liquid boundary, curve bO, and the liquid–vapor boundary, curve cO. Upon crossing a boundary (as temperature and/or pressure is altered), one phase 
transforms into another. For example, at 1 atm pressure, during heating the solid phase transforms to the liquid phase (i.e., melting occurs) at the point labeled 2 on Figure 9.2 (i.e., the intersection of the dashed horizontal line with the solid–liquid phase boundary); this point corresponds to a temperature of 0 °C. The reverse transformation (liquid-to-solid, or 
solidification) takes place at the same point upon cooling. Similarly, at the intersection of the dashed line with the liquid–vapor phase boundary (point 3 in Figure 9.2, at 100 °C) the 
liquid transforms into the vapor phase (or vaporizes) upon heating; condensation occurs for cooling. Finally, solid ice sublimes or vaporizes upon crossing the curve labeled aO.
As may also be noted from Figure 9.2, all three of the phase boundary curves intersect at 
a common point, which is labeled O  (for this H
2O system, at a temperature of 273.16 K and 
a pressure of 6.04 × 10−3 atm). This means that at this point only, all of the solid, liquid, 
and vapor phases are simultaneously in equilibrium with one another. Appropriately, this, 
and any other point on a P –T phase diagram where three phases are in equilibrium, is called 
a triple point; sometimes it is also termed an invariant point inasmuch as its position is distinct, 
or fixed by definite values of pressure and temperature. Any deviation from this point by a change of temperature and/or pressure will cause at least one of the phases to disappear.
Pressure–temperature phase diagrams for a number of substances have been deter-
mined experimentally, which also have solid-, liquid-, and vapor-phase regions. In those instances when multiple solid phases (i.e., allotropes, Section 3.6) exist, there appears a region on the diagram for each solid phase and also other triple points.Figure 9.2  Pressure–temperature phase 
diagram for H2O. Intersection of the dashed 
horizontal line at 1 atm pressure with the solid–
liquid phase boundary (point 2) corresponds to the melting point at this pressure (T = 0°C). 
Similarly, point 3, the intersection with the liquid–vapor boundary, represents the boiling point (T = 100°C).Liquid

Another type of extremely common phase diagram is one in which temperature and 
composition are variable parameters and pressure is held constant—normally 1 atm. There are several different varieties; in the present discussion, we will concern ourselves 
9.7 Binary Isomorphous Systems  •   257
Possibly the easiest type of binary phase diagram to understand and interpret is the 
type that is characterized by the copper–nickel system (Figure 9.3 a). Temperature is 
plotted along the ordinate, and the abscissa represents the composition of the alloy, in weight percent of nickel. The composition ranges from 0 wt% Ni (100 wt% Cu) on the far left horizontal extreme to 100 wt% Ni (0 wt% Cu) on the right. Three different phase regions, or fields,  appear on the diagram: an alpha ( 𝛼) field, a liquid (L ) field, 
and a two-phase 𝛼 + L field. Each region is defined by the phase or phases that exist 
over the range of temperatures and compositions delineated by the phase boundary lines.
The liquid L is a homogeneous liquid solution composed of both copper and nickel. 
The 𝛼 phase is a substitutional solid solution consisting of both Cu and Ni atoms and 
has an FCC crystal structure. At temperatures below about 1080 °C, copper and nickel 
are mutually soluble in each other in the solid state for all compositions. This complete solubility is explained by the fact that both Cu and Ni have the same crystal structure (FCC), nearly identical atomic radii and electronegativities, and similar valences, as dis-cussed in Section 4.3. The copper–nickel system is termed isomorphous because of this 
complete liquid and solid solubility of the two components.
Some comments are in order regarding nomenclature: First, for metallic alloys, solid 
solutions are commonly designated by lowercase Greek letters ( 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, etc.). With regard 
to phase boundaries, the line separating the L  and 𝛼 + L phase fields is termed the liq-
uidus line, as indicated in Figure 9.3a ; the liquid phase is present at all temperatures and 
compositions above this line. The solidus line  is located between the 𝛼 and 𝛼 + L regions, 
below which only the solid 𝛼 phase exists.
For Figure 9.3a, the solidus and liquidus lines intersect at the two composition 
extremes; these correspond to the melting temperatures of the pure components. For example, the melting temperatures of pure copper and nickel are 1085 °C and 1455 °C, 
respectively. Heating pure copper corresponds to moving vertically up the left-hand temperature axis. Copper remains solid until its melting temperature is reached. The solid-to-liquid transformation takes place at the melting temperature, and no further heating is possible until this transformation has been completed.
For any composition other than pure components, this melting phenomenon occurs 
over the range of temperatures between the solidus and liquidus lines; both solid 𝛼 and 
liquid phases are in equilibrium within this temperature range. For example, upon heat-ing of an alloy of composition 50 wt% Ni–50 wt% Cu (Figure 9.3 a), melting begins at 
approximately 1280 °C (2340 °F); the amount of liquid phase continuously increases with 
temperature until about 1320 °C (2410 °F), at which point the alloy is completely liquid.isomorphous9.7 BINARY ISOMORPHOUS SYSTEMSwith binary alloys—those that contain two components. If more than two components are present, phase diagrams become extremely complicated and difficult to represent. An explanation of the principles governing and the interpretation of phase diagrams can be demonstrated using binary alloys even though most alloys contain more than two components.
Binary phase diagrams are maps that represent the relationships between tempera-
ture and the compositions and quantities of phases at equilibrium, which influence the microstructure of an alloy. Many microstructures develop from phase transformations,  
the changes that occur when the temperature is altered (typically upon cooling). This may involve the transition from one phase to another or the appearance or disappear-ance of a phase. Binary phase diagrams are helpful in predicting phase transformations and the resulting microstructures, which may have equilibrium or nonequilibrium character.

9.8 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams  •   259
For a binary system of known composition and temperature at equilibrium, at least three 
kinds of information are available: (1) the phases that are present, (2) the compositions of these phases, and (3) the percentages or fractions of the phases. The procedures for making these determinations will be demonstrated using the copper–nickel system.
Phases Present
The establishment of what phases are present is relatively simple. One just locates the temperature–composition point on the diagram and notes the phase(s) with which the corresponding phase field is labeled. For example, an alloy of composition 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu at 1100 °C would be located at point A  in Figure 9.3a ; because this is within the 𝛼 
region, only the single 𝛼 phase will be present. However, a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy at 
1250 °C (point B ) consists of both 𝛼 and liquid phases at equilibrium.
Determination of Phase Compositions
The first step in the determination of phase compositions (in terms of the concentrations of the components) is to locate the temperature–composition point on the phase dia-gram. Different methods are used for single- and two-phase regions. If only one phase is present, the procedure is trivial: The composition of this phase is simply the same as the overall composition of the alloy. For example, consider the 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu alloy at 1100 °C (point A, Figure 9.3a). At this composition and temperature, only the 𝛼 
phase is present, having a composition of 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu.
For an alloy having composition and temperature located in a two-phase region, 
the situation is more complicated. In all two-phase regions (and in two-phase regions only), one may imagine a series of horizontal lines, one at every temperature; each of these is known as a tie line, or sometimes as an isotherm. These tie lines extend across 
the two-phase region and terminate at the phase boundary lines on either side. To compute the equilibrium concentrations of the two phases, the following procedure is used:
 1. A tie line is constructed across the two-phase region at the temperature of the alloy.
 2. The intersections of the tie line and the phase boundaries on either side are noted. 3. Perpendiculars are dropped from these intersections to the horizontal composition 
axis, from which the composition of each of the respective phases is read.
For example, consider again the 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy at 1250 °C, located 
at point B in Figure 9.3b and lying within the 𝛼 + L region. Thus, the problem is to 
determine the composition (in wt% Ni and Cu) for both the 𝛼 and liquid phases. The 
tie line is constructed across the 𝛼 + L phase region, as shown in Figure 9.3b. The per-
pendicular from the intersection of the tie line with the liquidus boundary meets the 
composition axis at 31.5 wt% Ni–68.5 wt% Cu, which is the composition of the liquid phase, C
L. Likewise, for the solidus–tie line intersection, we find a composition for the 
𝛼 solid-solution phase, C𝛼, of 42.5 wt% Ni–57.5 wt% Cu.
Determination of Phase Amounts
The relative amounts (as fraction or as percentage) of the phases present at equilibrium may also be computed with the aid of phase diagrams. Again, the single- and two-phase situations must be treated separately. The solution is obvious in the single-phase region. Because only one phase is present, the alloy is composed entirely of that phase—that is, the phase fraction is 1.0, or, alternatively, the percentage is 100%. From the previous example for the 60 wt% Ni–40 wt% Cu alloy at 1100 °C (point A in Figure 9.3a), only 
the 𝛼 phase is present; hence, the alloy is completely, or 100%, 𝛼.   : VMSE

260  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
If the composition and temperature position is located within a two-phase region, 
things are more complex. The tie line must be used in conjunction with a procedure that 
is often called the lever rule (or the inverse lever rule), which is applied as follows:
 1. The tie line is constructed across the two-phase region at the temperature of the alloy.
 2. The overall alloy composition is located on the tie line. 3. The fraction of one phase is computed by taking the length of tie line from the 
overall alloy composition to the phase boundary for the other phase and dividing 
by the total tie line length.
 4. The fraction of the other phase is determined in the same manner. 5. If phase percentages are desired, each phase fraction is multiplied by 100. When 
the composition axis is scaled in weight percent, the phase fractions computed 
using the lever rule are mass fractions —the mass (or weight) of a specific phase 
divided by the total alloy mass (or weight). The mass of each phase is computed from the product of each phase fraction and the total alloy mass.
In the use of the lever rule, tie line segment lengths may be determined either by 
direct measurement from the phase diagram using a linear scale, preferably graduated in 
millimeters, or by subtracting compositions as taken from the composition axis.
Consider again the example shown in Figure 9.3b , in which at 1250 °C both 𝛼 and 
liquid phases are present for a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy. The problem is to com-pute the fraction of each of the 𝛼 and liquid phases. The tie line is constructed that 
was used for the determination of 𝛼 and L  phase compositions. Let the overall alloy 
composition be located along the tie line and denoted as C
0, and let the mass fractions 
be represented by WL and W𝛼 for the respective phases. From the lever rule, WL may 
be computed according to
 WL=S
R+S (9.1a)
or, by subtracting compositions,
 WL=C𝛼−C0
C𝛼−CL (9.1b)
Composition need be specified in terms of only one of the constituents for a binary 
alloy; for the preceding computation, weight percent nickel is used (i.e., C0 = 35 wt% 
Ni, C𝛼=42.5 wt% Ni, and CL = 31.5 wt% Ni), and
WL=42.5 −35

9.8 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams  •   261
Of course, identical answers are obtained if compositions are expressed in weight per-
cent copper instead of nickel.
Thus, the lever rule may be employed to determine the relative amounts or frac-
tions of phases in any two-phase region for a binary alloy if the temperature and com-position are known and if equilibrium has been established. Its derivation is presented as an example problem.
It is easy to confuse the foregoing procedures for the determination of phase 
compositions and fractional phase amounts; thus, a brief summary is warranted. Compositions of phases are expressed in terms of weight percents of the components (e.g., wt% Cu, wt% Ni). For any alloy consisting of a single phase, the composition of that phase is the same as the total alloy composition. If two phases are present, the tie line must be employed, the extremes of which detetrmine the compositions of the respective phases. With regard to fractional phase amounts (e.g., mass fraction of the 𝛼 or liquid phase), when a single phase exists, the alloy is completely that 
phase. For a two-phase alloy, the lever rule is used, in which a ratio of tie line seg-ment lengths is taken.

Consider the phase diagram for copper and nickel (Figure 9.3 b) and alloy of composition C0 at 
1250 °C, and let C𝛼, CL, W𝛼, and WL represent the same parameters as given earlier. This deri-
vation is accomplished through two conservation-of-mass expressions. With the first, because 
only two phases are present, the sum of their mass fractions must be equal to unity; that is,
 W𝛼+WL=1 (9.3)

262  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
For multiphase alloys, it is often more convenient to specify relative phase amount 
in terms of volume fraction rather than mass fraction. Phase volume fractions are pre-
ferred because they (rather than mass fractions) may be determined from examination of the microstructure; furthermore, the properties of a multiphase alloy may be esti-mated on the basis of volume fractions.
For an alloy consisting of 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases, the volume fraction of the 𝛼 phase, V
𝛼, 
is defined as
 V𝛼=v𝛼
v𝛼+v𝛽 (9.5)
where v𝛼 and v𝛽 denote the volumes of the respective phases in the alloy. An analogous 
expression exists for V𝛽, and, for an alloy consisting of just two phases, it is the case that 
V𝛼+V𝛽=1.
On occasion, conversion from mass fraction to volume fraction (or vice versa) is 
desired. Equations that facilitate these conversions are as follows:
 V𝛼=W𝛼
𝜌𝛼
W𝛼
𝜌𝛼+W𝛽
𝜌𝛽 (9.6a)
 V𝛽=W𝛽

 W𝛼=V𝛼  𝜌𝛼
V𝛼  𝜌𝛼+V𝛽  𝜌𝛽 (9.7a)
 W𝛽=V𝛽  𝜌𝛽
V𝛼  𝜌𝛼+V𝛽  𝜌𝛽 (9.7b)
In these expressions, 𝜌𝛼 and 𝜌𝛽 are the densities of the respective phases; these may be 
determined approximately using Equations 4.10a and 4.10b.𝛼 phase volume

9.9 Development of Microstructure in Isomorphous Alloys   •  263
When the densities of the phases in a two-phase alloy differ significantly, there will 
be quite a disparity between mass and volume fractions; conversely, if the phase densi-
ties are the same, mass and volume fractions are identical.
Equilibrium Cooling
At this point it is instructive to examine the development of microstructure that occurs for isomorphous alloys during solidification. We first treat the situation in which the cooling occurs very slowly, in that phase equilibrium is continuously maintained.
Let us consider the copper–nickel system (Figure 9.3a ), specifically an alloy of 
composition 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu as it is cooled from 1300 °C. The region of the 
Cu–Ni phase diagram in the vicinity of this composition is shown in Figure 9.4. Cooling of an alloy of this composition corresponds to moving down the vertical dashed line. At 1300 °C, point a , the alloy is completely liquid (of composition 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% 
Cu) and has the microstructure represented by the circle inset in the figure. As cooling begins, no microstructural or compositional changes will be realized until we reach the liquidus line (point b , ~1260 °C). At this point, the first solid 𝛼 begins to form, which    : VMSE

has a composition dictated by the tie line drawn at this temperature [i.e., 46 wt% 
Ni–54 wt% Cu, noted as 𝛼(46 Ni)]; the composition of liquid is still approximately 
35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu [L (35 Ni)], which is different from that of the solid 𝛼. With 
continued cooling, both compositions and relative amounts of each of the phases will change. The compositions of the liquid and 𝛼 phases will follow the liquidus and 
solidus lines, respectively. Furthermore, the fraction of the 𝛼 phase will increase with 
continued cooling. Note that the overall alloy composition (35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu) remains unchanged during cooling even though there is a redistribution of copper and nickel between the phases.
At 1240 °C, point c  in Figure 9.4, the compositions of the liquid and 𝛼 phases are 
29 wt% Ni–71 wt% Cu [L (29 Ni)] and 40 wt% Ni–60 wt% Cu [ 𝛼(40 Ni)], respectively.
The solidification process is virtually complete at about 1220 °C, point d ; the 
composition of the solid 𝛼 is approximately 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu (the overall al-
loy composition), whereas that of the last remaining liquid is 24 wt% Ni–76 wt% Cu. Upon crossing the solidus line, this remaining liquid solidifies; the final product then is a polycrystalline 𝛼-phase solid solution that has a uniform 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu 
composition (point e, Figure 9.4). Subsequent cooling produces no microstructural or 
compositional alterations.
Nonequilibrium Cooling
Conditions of equilibrium solidification and the development of microstructures, as described in the previous section, are realized only for extremely slow cooling rates. The reason for this is that with changes in temperature, there must be re-adjustments in the compositions of the liquid and solid phases in accordance with the phase diagram (i.e., with the liquidus and solidus lines), as discussed. These readjustments are accomplished by diffusional processes—that is, diffusion in both solid and liquid phases and also across the solid–liquid interface. Because diffusion is a time-dependent phenomenon (Section 5.3), to maintain equilibrium during cooling, sufficient time must be allowed at each temperature for the appropriate compositional readjustments. Diffusion rates (i.e., the magnitudes of the diffusion coefficients) are especially low for the solid phase and, for both phases, decrease with diminishing temperature. In virtually all practical solidification situations, cooling rates are much too rapid to allow these compositional readjustments and maintenance of equilibrium; consequently, microstructures other than those previ-ously described develop.
Some of the consequences of nonequilibrium solidification for isomorphous al-
loys will now be discussed by considering a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy, the same composition that was used for equilibrium cooling in the previous section. The por-tion of the phase diagram near this composition is shown in Figure 9.5; in addition, microstructures and associated phase compositions at various temperatures upon cooling are noted in the circular insets. To simplify this discussion, it will be assumed that diffusion rates in the liquid phase are sufficiently rapid such that equilibrium is maintained in the liquid.
Let us begin cooling from a temperature of about 1300 °C; this is indicated by point 
a′ in the liquid region. This liquid has a composition of 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu [noted 
as L(35 Ni) in the figure], and no changes occur while cooling through the liquid phase 
region (moving down vertically from point a′). At point b′ (approximately 1260 °C), 
𝛼-phase particles begin to form, which, from the tie line constructed, have a composition 
of 46 wt% Ni–54 wt% Cu [ 𝛼(46 Ni)].
Upon further cooling to point c′ (about 1240 °C), the liquid composition has 
shifted to 29 wt% Ni–71 wt% Cu; furthermore, at this temperature the composition of 
9.9 Development of Microstructure in Isomorphous Alloys   •  265
the 𝛼 phase that solidified is 40 wt% Ni–60 wt% Cu [ 𝛼(40 Ni)]. However, because dif-
fusion in the solid 𝛼 phase is relatively slow, the 𝛼 phase that formed at point b′ has not 
changed composition appreciably—that is, it is still about 46 wt% Ni—and the composi-
tion of the 𝛼 grains has continuously changed with radial position, from 46 wt% Ni at 
grain centers to 40 wt% Ni at the outer grain perimeters. Thus, at point c′, the average 
composition of the solid 𝛼 grains that have formed would be some volume-weighted 
average composition lying between 46 and 40 wt% Ni. For the sake of argument, let us take this average composition to be 42 wt% Ni–58 wt% Cu [ 𝛼(42 Ni)]. Furthermore, 
we would also find that, on the basis of lever-rule computations, a greater proportion of liquid is present for these nonequilibrium conditions than for equilibrium cooling. The implication of this nonequilibrium solidification phenomenon is that the solidus line on the phase diagram has been shifted to higher Ni contents—to the average com-positions of the 𝛼 phase (e.g., 42 wt% Ni at 1240 °C)—and is represented by the dashed 
line in Figure 9.5. There is no comparable alteration of the liquidus line inasmuch as it is assumed that equilibrium is maintained in the liquid phase during cooling because of sufficiently rapid diffusion rates.
At point d′ (~1220 °C) and for equilibrium cooling rates, solidification should be 
completed. However, for this nonequilibrium situation, there is still an appreciable Figure 9.5  Schematic representation 
of the development of microstructure 
during the nonequilibrium solidification of a 35 wt% Ni–65 wt% Cu alloy.

proportion of liquid remaining, and the 𝛼 phase that is forming has a composition of 
35 wt% Ni [ 𝛼(35 Ni)]; also the average 𝛼-phase composition at this point is 38 wt% 
Ni [𝛼(38 Ni)].
Nonequilibrium solidification finally reaches completion at point e′ (~1205 °C). The 
composition of the last 𝛼 phase to solidify at this point is about 31 wt% Ni; the average 
composition of the 𝛼 phase at complete solidification is 35 wt% Ni. The inset at point 
f′ shows the microstructure of the totally solid material.
The degree of displacement of the nonequilibrium solidus curve from the equilib-
rium one depends on the rate of cooling; the slower the cooling rate, the smaller this 
displacement—that is, the difference between the equilibrium solidus and average solid composition is lower. Furthermore, if the diffusion rate in the solid phase increases, this displacement decreases.
There are some important consequences for isomorphous alloys that have solidi-
fied under nonequilibrium conditions. As discussed earlier, the distribution of the two elements within the grains is nonuniform, a phenomenon termed segregation— that is, 
concentration gradients are established across the grains that are represented by the in-sets of Figure 9.5. The center of each grain, which is the first part to freeze, is rich in the high-melting element (e.g., nickel for this Cu–Ni system), whereas the concentration of the low-melting element increases with position from this region to the grain boundary. This is termed a cored structure, which gives rise to less than the optimal properties. As a casting having a cored structure is reheated, grain boundary regions melt first because they are richer in the low-melting component. This produces a sudden loss in mechanical integrity due to the thin liquid film that separates the grains. Furthermore, this melting may begin at a temperature below the equilibrium solidus temperature of the alloy. Coring may be eliminated by a homogenization heat treatment carried out at a temperature below the solidus point for the particular alloy composition. During this process, atomic diffusion occurs, which produces compositionally homogeneous grains.
We now briefly explore how the mechanical properties of solid isomorphous alloys are affected by composition as other structural variables (e.g., grain size) are held constant. For all temperatures and compositions below the melting temperature of the lowest-melting component, only a single solid phase exists. Therefore, each component experi-ences solid-solution strengthening (Section 7.9) or an increase in strength and hardness by additions of the other component. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 9.6 a as 
tensile strength versus composition for the copper–nickel system at room temperature; at some intermediate composition, the curve necessarily passes through a maximum. Plotted in Figure 9.6b is the ductility (%EL)–composition behavior, which is just the opposite of tensile strength—that is, ductility decreases with additions of the second component, and the curve exhibits a minimum.
9.10  MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS
Another type of common and relatively simple phase diagram found for binary alloys is 
shown in Figure 9.7 for the copper–silver system; this is known as a binary eutectic phase diagram. A number of features of this phase diagram are important and worth noting. First, three single-phase regions are found on the diagram: 𝛼, 𝛽, and liquid. The 𝛼 phase 
is a solid solution rich in copper; it has silver as the solute component and an FCC crystal structure. The 𝛽-phase solid solution also has an FCC structure, but copper is the solute. 
Pure copper and pure silver are also considered to be 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases, respectively.9.11 BINARY EUTECTIC SYSTEMS

Thus, the solubility in each of these solid phases is limited, in that at any tempera-
ture below line BEG only a limited concentration of silver dissolves in copper (for the 
𝛼 phase), and similarly for copper in silver (for the 𝛽 phase). The solubility limit for the 
𝛼 phase corresponds to the boundary line, labeled CBA, between the 𝛼/(𝛼 + 𝛽) and 
𝛼/(𝛼 + L) phase regions; it increases with temperature to a maximum [8.0 wt% Ag at Figure 9.6  For the copper–nickel system, (a) tensile strength versus composition and (b) ductility (%EL) versus

779°C (1434 °F)] at point B, and decreases back to zero at the melting temperature of 
pure copper, point A [1085 °C (1985 °F)]. At temperatures below 779 °C (1434 °F), the 
solid solubility limit line separating the 𝛼 and 𝛼 + 𝛽 phase regions is termed a solvus 
line; the boundary AB between the 𝛼 and 𝛼 + L fields is the solidus line, as indicated 
in Figure 9.7. For the 𝛽 phase, both solvus and solidus lines also exist, HG and GF, 
respectively, as shown. The maximum solubility of copper in the 𝛽 phase, point G (8.8 
wt% Cu), also occurs at 779 °C (1434 °F). This horizontal line BEG, which is parallel to 
the composition axis and extends between these maximum solubility positions, may also 
be considered a solidus line; it represents the lowest temperature at which a liquid phase may exist for any copper–silver alloy that is at equilibrium.
There are also three two-phase regions found for the copper–silver system 
(Figure 9.7): 𝛼 + L, 𝛽 + L, and 𝛼 + 𝛽. The 𝛼- and 𝛽-phase solid solutions coexist 
for all compositions and temperatures within the 𝛼 + 𝛽 phase field; the 𝛼 + liquid 
and 𝛽 + liquid phases also coexist in their respective phase regions. Furthermore, 
compositions and relative amounts for the phases may be determined using tie lines and the lever rule as outlined previously.
As silver is added to copper, the temperature at which the alloys become totally liquid 
decreases along the liquidus line, line AE; thus, the melting temperature of copper is 
lowered by silver additions. The same may be said for silver: The introduction of copper reduces the temperature of complete melting along the other liquidus line, FE. These liqui-
dus lines meet at the point E  on the phase diagram, which point is designated by composi-
tion C
E and temperature TE; for the copper–silver system, the values of CE and TE are 71.9 
wt% Ag and 779 °C (1434 °F), respectively. It should also be noted there is a horizontal iso-
therm at 779 °C and represented by the line labeled BEG that also passes through point E .
An important reaction occurs for an alloy of composition CE as it changes tempera-
ture in passing through TE; this reaction may be written as follows:
 L(CE)⇌cooling
heating𝛼(C𝛼E)+𝛽(C𝛽E)  (9.8)
Or, upon cooling, a liquid phase is transformed into the two solid 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases at the 
temperature TE; the opposite reaction occurs upon heating. This is called a eutectic reac-
tion ( eutectic means “easily melted”), and point E on the diagram is called the eutectic 
point; furthermore, CE and TE represent the eutectic composition and temperature, 
respectively. As also noted on Figure 9.7, C𝛼E and C𝛽E are the respective compositions 
of the 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases at TE. Thus, for the copper–silver system, the eutectic reaction, 
Equation 9.8, may also be written as follows:
L(71.9 wt% Ag) ⇌cooling
heating𝛼(8.0 wt% Ag) +𝛽(91.2 wt% Ag)
This eutectic reaction is termed an invariant reaction inasmuch as it occurs under equi-
librium conditions at a specific temperature (TE) and specific compositions (CE, C𝛼E and 
C𝛽E), which are constant (i.e., invariable) for a specific binary system.1 Furthermore, the 
horizontal solidus line BEG at TE is sometimes called the eutectic isotherm.
The eutectic reaction, upon cooling, is similar to solidification for pure components 
in that the reaction proceeds to completion at a constant temperature, or isothermally, solvus line

and peritectic reactions. On the other hand, not all invariant reactions have horizontal lines; for example, melting (and solidification) of the pure components (in the present case lead and tin) are invariant reactions.

at TE. However, the solid product of eutectic solidification is always two solid phases, 
whereas for a pure component only a single phase forms. Because of this eutectic reac-
tion, phase diagrams similar to that in Figure 9.7 are termed eutectic phase diagrams; 
components exhibiting this behavior make up a eutectic system.
In the construction of binary phase diagrams, it is important to understand that one 
or at most two phases may be in equilibrium within a phase field. This holds true for the phase diagrams in Figures 9.3a and 9.7. For a eutectic system, three phases ( 𝛼, 𝛽, and L) 
may be in equilibrium, but only at points along the eutectic isotherm. Another general rule is that single-phase regions are always separated from each other by a two-phase region that consists of the two single phases that it separates. For example, the 𝛼+𝛽 
field is situated between the 𝛼 and 𝛽 single-phase regions in Figure 9.7.
Another common eutectic system is that for lead and tin; the phase diagram 
(Figure 9.8) has a general shape similar to that for copper–silver. For the lead–tin system, the solid-solution phases are also designated by 𝛼 and 𝛽; in this case, 𝛼 repre-
sents a solid solution of tin in lead; for 𝛽, tin is the solvent and lead is the solute. The 
eutectic point is located at 61.9 wt% Sn and 183 °C (361 °F). Of course, maximum solid 
solubility compositions as well as component melting temperatures are different for the copper–silver and lead–tin systems, as may be observed by comparing their phase diagrams.
On occasion, low-melting-temperature alloys are prepared having near-eutectic com-
positions. A familiar example is 60–40 solder, which contains 60 wt% Sn and 40 wt% Pb. Tutorial Video:

Determination of Phases Present and Computation of Phase Compositions
For a 40 wt% Sn–60 wt% Pb alloy at 150 °C (300°F), (a) what phase(s) is (are) present? 
(b) What is (are) the composition(s) of the phase(s)?
Solution
(a)  Locate this temperature–composition point on the phase diagram (point B in Figure 9.9). 
Inasmuch as it is within the 𝛼+𝛽 region, both 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases will coexist.
(b)  Because two phases are present, it becomes necessary to construct a tie line across the 
𝛼+𝛽 phase field at 150 °C, as indicated in Figure 9.9. The composition of the 𝛼 phase 
corresponds to the tie line intersection with the 𝛼/(𝛼+𝛽) solvus phase boundary—about 
11 wt% Sn–89 wt% Pb, denoted as C𝛼. This is similar for the 𝛽 phase, which has a com-
position of approximately 98 wt% Sn–2 wt% Pb ( C𝛽).Concept Check 9.5 At 700°C (1290°F), what is the maximum solubility (a) of Cu in Ag?

Figure 9.9  The lead–tin phase diagram. For a 40 wt% Sn–60 wt% Pb alloy at 150 °C (point B), 
phase compositions and relative amounts are computed in Example Problems 9.2 and 9.3.
EXAMPLE PROBLEM 9.3
Relative Phase Amount Determinations—Mass and Volume Fractions
For the lead–tin alloy in Example Problem 9.2, calculate the relative amount of each phase 
present in terms of (a) mass fraction and (b) volume fraction. At 150 °C, take the densities of 
Pb and Sn to be 11.35 and 7.29 g/cm3, respectively.
Solution
(a)  Because the alloy consists of two phases, it is necessary to employ the lever rule. If C1 
denotes the overall alloy composition, mass fractions may be computed by subtracting compositions, in terms of weight percent tin, as follows:
2
W𝛼=C𝛽−C1
C𝛽−C𝛼=98−40
98−11=0.67
W𝛽=C1−C𝛼
C𝛽−C𝛼=40−11
98−11=0.33
(b)  To compute volume fractions it is first necessary to determine the density of each phase 
using Equation 4.10a. Thus
𝜌𝛼=100
CSn(𝛼)
𝜌Sn+CPb(𝛼)
𝜌Pb
2Please note: The lever rule cannot be used at the eutectic isotherm temperature TE for compositions between C𝛼E and 
C𝛽E (Figure 9.7) because three phases are in equilibrium. However, the lever rule can be used for samples in this 
composition range in the two-phase regions that exist at temperatures that are higher or lower than TE by even a fraction 
of a degree. In general, the lever rule cannot be used at any horizontal invariant in a two-component phase diagram.Tutorial Video:

where CSn(𝛼) and CPb(𝛼) denote the concentrations in weight percent of tin and lead, respectively, 
in the 𝛼 phase. From Example Problem 9.2, these values are 11 wt% and 89 wt%. Incorporation 
of these values along with the densities of the two components leads to

Depending on composition, several different types of microstructures are possible for 
the slow cooling of alloys belonging to binary eutectic systems. These possibilities will be considered in terms of the lead–tin phase diagram, Figure 9.8.
The first case is for compositions ranging between a pure component and the maxi-
mum solid solubility for that component at room temperature [20 °C (70 °F)]. For the 
lead–tin system, this includes lead-rich alloys containing between 0 and about 2 wt% Sn (for the 𝛼-phase solid solution) and also between approximately 99 wt% Sn and pure 9.12  DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN

Lead-Free SoldersMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 9 . 1
Solders are metal alloys that are used to bond 
or join two or more components (usually other 
metal alloys). They are used extensively in the electronics industry to physically hold assemblies together; they must allow expansion and contraction of the various components, transmit electrical signals, and dissipate any heat that is generated. The bonding action is accomplished by melting the solder material and allowing it to flow among and make contact with the components to be joined (which do not melt); finally, upon solidification, it forms a physical bond with all of these components.
In the past, the vast majority of solders have been 
lead–tin alloys. These materials are reliable and inex-pensive and have relatively low melting temperatures. The most common lead–tin solder has a composition of 63 wt% Sn–37 wt% Pb. According to the lead–tin phase diagram, Figure 9.8, this composition is near the eutectic and has a melting temperature of about 183 °C, 
the lowest temperature possible with the existence of a liquid phase (at equilibrium) for the lead–tin system. This alloy is often called a eutectic lead–tin solder.
Unfortunately, lead is a mildly toxic metal, and 
there is serious concern about the environmental impact of discarded lead-containing products that can leach into groundwater from landfills or pollute the air if inciner-ated.
3 Consequently, in some countries legislation has 
been enacted that bans the use of lead-containing sol-ders. This has forced the development of lead-free sol-ders that, among other things, must have relatively low melting temperatures (or temperature ranges). Many of these are tin alloys that contain relatively low concentra-tions of copper, silver, bismuth, and/or antimony. Com-positions as well as liquidus and solidus temperatures for several lead-free solders are listed in Table 9.1. Two lead-containing solders are also included in this table.
Melting temperatures (or temperature ranges) 
are important in the development and selection of these new solder alloys, information available from phase diagrams. For example, a portion of the tin-rich side of the silver–tin phase diagram is presented in Figure 9.10. Here, it may be noted that a eutectic ex-ists at 96.5 wt% Sn and 221 °C; these are indeed the 
composition and melting temperature, respectively, of the 96.5 Sn–3.5 Ag solder in Table 9.1.Table 9.1   Compositions, Solidus Temperatures,

tin (for the 𝛽 phase). For example, consider an alloy of composition C1 (Figure 9.11) 
as it is slowly cooled from a temperature within the liquid-phase region, say, 350 °C; 
this corresponds to moving down the dashed vertical line wwʹ in the figure. The alloy 
remains totally liquid and of composition C1 until we cross the liquidus line at approxi-
mately 330 °C, at which time the solid 𝛼 phase begins to form. While passing through 
this narrow 𝛼+L phase region, solidification proceeds in the same manner as was 
described for the copper–nickel alloy in the preceding section—that is, with continued 
cooling, more of the solid 𝛼 forms. Furthermore, liquid- and solid-phase compositions 
are different, which follow along the liquidus and solidus phase boundaries, respectively. Solidification reaches completion at the point where wwʹ crosses the solidus line. The 
resulting alloy is polycrystalline with a uniform composition of C
1, and no subsequent 
changes occur upon cooling to room temperature. This microstructure is represented schematically by the inset at point c in Figure 9.11.
The second case considered is for compositions that range between the room tem-
perature solubility limit and the maximum solid solubility at the eutectic temperature. For the lead–tin system (Figure 9.8), these compositions extend from about 2 to 18.3 wt% Sn (for lead-rich alloys) and from 97.8 to approximately 99 wt% Sn (for tin-rich alloys). Let us examine an alloy of composition C
2 as it is cooled along the vertical line 
xxʹ in Figure 9.12. Down to the intersection of xxʹ and the solvus line, changes that occur are similar to the previous case as we pass through the corresponding phase regions (as demonstrated by the insets at points d, e, and f ). Just above the solvus intersection, point 
f, the microstructure consists of 𝛼 grains of composition C
2. Upon crossing the solvus 
line, the 𝛼 solid solubility is exceeded, which results in the formation of small 𝛽-phase 
particles; these are indicated in the microstructure inset at point g. With continued + L

cooling, these particles grow in size because the mass fraction of the 𝛽 phase increases 
slightly with decreasing temperature.
The third case involves solidification of the eutectic composition, 61.9 wt% Sn (C3 in 
Figure 9.13). Consider an alloy having this composition that is cooled from a temperature 
within the liquid-phase region (e.g., 250 °C) down the vertical line yyʹ in Figure 9.13. As 
the temperature is lowered, no changes occur until we reach the eutectic temperature, 183°C. Upon crossing the eutectic isotherm, the liquid transforms into the two 𝛼 and 𝛽 
phases. This transformation may be represented by the reaction
 L(61.9 wt% Sn)⇌cooling
heating𝛼(18.3 wt% Sn) +𝛽(97.8 wt% Sn) (9.9)
in which the 𝛼- and 𝛽-phase compositions are dictated by the eutectic isotherm end points.
During this transformation, there must be a redistribution of the lead and tin 
components because the 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases have different compositions, neither of which 
is the same as that of the liquid (as indicated in Equation 9.9). This redistribution is ac-
complished by atomic diffusion. The microstructure of the solid that results from this transformation consists of alternating layers (sometimes called lamellae) of the 𝛼 and 
𝛽 phases that form simultaneously during the transformation. This microstructure, rep-
resented schematically in Figure 9.13, point i, is called a eutectic structure and is char-
acteristic of this reaction. A photomicrograph of this structure for the lead–tin eutectic is shown in Figure 9.14. Subsequent cooling of the alloy from just below the eutectic to room temperature results in only minor microstructural alterations.   : VMSE

The microstructural change that accompanies this eutectic transformation is repre-
sented schematically in Figure 9.15, which shows the 𝛼−𝛽 layered eutectic growing into

diffusion in the liquid just ahead of the eutectic–liquid interface. The arrows indicate the directions of diffusion of lead and tin atoms; lead atoms diffuse toward the 𝛼-phase layers

diffusion of tin is in the direction of the 𝛽, tin-rich (97.8 wt% Sn–2.2 wt% Pb) layers. The 
eutectic structure forms in these alternating layers because, for this lamellar configuration, 
atomic diffusion of lead and tin need only occur over relatively short distances.
The fourth and final microstructural case for this system includes all compositions 
other than the eutectic that, when cooled, cross the eutectic isotherm. Consider, for example, the composition C
4 in Figure 9.16, which lies to the left of the eutectic; as 
the temperature is lowered, we move down the line zzʹ, beginning at point j. The mi-
crostructural development between points j and l is similar to that for the second case, 
such that just prior to crossing the eutectic isotherm (point l), the 𝛼 and liquid phases 
are present with compositions of approximately 18.3 and 61.9 wt% Sn, respectively, as determined from the appropriate tie line. As the temperature is lowered to just below the eutectic, the liquid phase, which is of the eutectic composition, transforms into the eutectic structure (i.e., alternating 𝛼 and 𝛽 lamellae); insignificant changes occur with 
the 𝛼 phase that formed during cooling through the 𝛼+L region. This microstructure 
is represented schematically by the inset at point m in Figure 9.16. Thus, the 𝛼 phase is 
present both in the eutectic structure and also as the phase that formed while cooling through the 𝛼+L phase field. To distinguish one 𝛼 from the other, that which resides 
in the eutectic structure is called eutectic 𝛼, whereas the other that formed prior to 
crossing the eutectic isotherm is termed primary 𝛼; both are labeled in Figure 9.16. 
The photomicrograph in Figure 9.17 is of a lead–tin alloy in which both primary 𝛼 and 
eutectic structures are shown.   : VMSE

Which Eutectic 
Microstructures Go 
with Which Regions 
on a Eutectic Phase 
Diagram?
278  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
In dealing with microstructures, it is sometimes convenient to use the term 
microconstituent —an element of the microstructure having an identifiable and char-
acteristic structure. For example, in the point m  inset in Figure 9.16, there are two 
microconstituents—primary 𝛼 and the eutectic structure. Thus, the eutectic structure 
is a microconstituent even though it is a mixture of two phases because it has a dis-
tinct lamellar structure with a fixed ratio of the two phases.
It is possible to compute the relative amounts of both eutectic and primary 𝛼 micro-
constituents. Because the eutectic microconstituent always forms from the liquid having the eutectic composition, this microconstituent may be assumed to have a composition of 61.9 wt% Sn. Hence, the lever rule is applied using a tie line between the 𝛼−(𝛼+𝛽) 
phase boundary (18.3 wt% Sn) and the eutectic composition. For example, consider the alloy of composition C
4′ in Figure 9.18. The fraction of the eutectic microconstituent We 
is just the same as the fraction of liquid WL from which it transforms, or

The fractions of total 𝛼, W𝛼 (both eutectic and primary), and also of total 𝛽, W𝛽, are

Analogous transformations and microstructures result for alloys having composi-
tions to the right of the eutectic (i.e., between 61.9 and 97.8 wt% Sn). However, below 
the eutectic temperature, the microstructure will consist of the eutectic and primary 𝛽 
microconstituents because, upon cooling from the liquid, we pass through the 𝛽 + liquid 
phase field.
When, for the fourth case represented in Figure 9.16, conditions of equilibrium are 
not maintained while passing through the 𝛼 (or 𝛽) + liquid phase region, the following 
consequences will be realized for the microstructure upon crossing the eutectic isotherm: (1) grains of the primary microconstituent will be cored, that is, have a nonuniform dis-tribution of solute across the grains; and (2) the fraction of the eutectic microconstituent formed will be greater than for the equilibrium situation.Lever rule expression

The isomorphous and eutectic phase diagrams discussed thus far are relatively sim-
ple, but those for many binary alloy systems are much more complex. The eutectic copper–silver and lead–tin phase diagrams (Figures 9.7 and 9.8) have only two solid phases, 𝛼 and 𝛽; these are sometimes termed terminal solid solutions because they 
exist over composition ranges near the concentration extremes of the phase dia-gram. For other alloy systems, intermediate solid solutions (or intermediate phases) 
may be found at other than the two composition extremes. Such is the case for the 
copper–zinc system. Its phase diagram (Figure 9.19) may at first appear formidable because there are some invariant reactions similar to the eutectic that have not yet been discussed. In addition, there are six different solid solutions—two terminal ( 𝛼

solid solution, one in which the copper and zinc atoms are situated in a specific and ordered arrangement within each unit cell.) Some phase boundary lines near the bottom of Figure 9.19 are dashed to indicate that their positions have not been exactly determined. The reason for this is that at low temperatures, diffusion rates are very slow, and inordinately long times are required to attain equilibrium. Again, only single- and two-phase regions are found on the diagram, and the same rules out-lined in Section 9.8 are used to compute phase compositions and relative amounts. terminal solid

The commercial brasses are copper–rich copper–zinc alloys; for example, cartridge 
brass has a composition of 70 wt% Cu–30 wt% Zn and a microstructure consisting of a single 𝛼 phase.
For some systems, discrete intermediate compounds rather than solid solutions may 
be found on the phase diagram, and these compounds have distinct chemical formulas; for metal–metal systems, they are called intermetallic compounds. For example, con-
sider the magnesium–lead system (Figure 9.20). The compound Mg
2Pb has a composi-
tion of 19 wt% Mg–81 wt% Pb (33 at% Pb) and is represented as a vertical line on the diagram, rather than as a phase region of finite width; hence, Mg
2Pb can exist by itself 
only at this precise composition.
Several other characteristics are worth noting for this magnesium–lead system. 
First, the compound Mg2Pb melts at approximately 550 °C (1020 °F), as indicated by 
point M in Figure 9.20. Also, the solubility of lead in magnesium is rather extensive, 
as indicated by the relatively large composition span for the 𝛼-phase field. However, 
the solubility of magnesium in lead is extremely limited. This is evident from the very narrow 𝛽 terminal solid-solution region on the right, or lead-rich, side of the diagram. 
Finally, this phase diagram may be thought of as two simple eutectic diagrams joined back to back, one for the Mg–Mg
2Pb system and the other for Mg2Pb–Pb; as such, the 
compound Mg2Pb is really considered to be a component. This separation of complex 
phase diagrams into smaller-component units may simplify them and expedite their interpretation.intermetallic

In addition to the eutectic, other invariant reactions involving three different phases are 
found for some alloy systems. One of these occurs for the copper–zinc system (Figure 9.19) at 560 °C (1040 °F) and 74 wt% Zn–26 wt% Cu. A portion of the phase diagram in this 
vicinity is enlarged in Figure 9.21. Upon cooling, a solid 𝛿 phase transforms into two other 
solid phases ( 𝛾 and 𝜀) according to the reaction
 
𝛿⇌cooling
heating𝛾+𝜀 (9.14)
The reverse reaction occurs upon heating. It is called a eutectoid (or eutectic-like) reaction; the eutectoid point is labeled E  on Figure 9.21. For this reaction, 560 °C is 
the eutectoid isotherm, 74 wt% Zn–26 wt% Cu is the eutectoid composition, whereas, the 𝛾 and 𝜀 product phases have compositions of 70 wt% Zn–30 wt% Cu and 78 wt% 
Zn–22 wt% Cu, respectively. The feature distinguishing eutectoid from eutectic is that one solid phase instead of a liquid transforms into two other solid phases at a single temperature. A eutectoid reaction found in the iron–carbon system (Section 9.18) is very important in the heat treating of steels.
The peritectic reaction is another invariant reaction involving three phases at 
equilibrium. With this reaction, upon heating, one solid phase transforms into a liquid phase and another solid phase. A peritectic exists for the copper–zinc system (Figure 9.21, point P ) at 598 °C (1108 °F) and 78.6 wt% Zn–21.4 wt% Cu; this reaction 
is as follows:
 
𝛿+L⇌cooling
heating𝜀 (9.15)
The low-temperature solid phase may be an intermediate solid solution (e.g., 𝜀 in the 
preceding reaction), or it may be a terminal solid solution. One of the latter peritectics 
exists at about 97 wt% Zn and 435 °C (815 °F) (see Figure 9.19), where the 𝜂 phase, when 
heated, transforms into 𝜀 and liquid phases. Three other peritectics are found for the 
Cu–Zn system, the reactions of which involve 𝛽, 𝛿, and 𝛾  intermediate solid solutions as 
the low-temperature phases that transform upon heating.The eutectoid

9.15 Congruent Phase Transformations  •   283
Phase transformations may be classified according to whether there is any change 
in composition for the phases involved. Those for which there are no compositional alterations are said to be congruent transformations. Conversely, for incongruent 
transformations, at least one of the phases experiences a change in composition. 
Examples of congruent transformations include allotropic transformations (Section 3.6) and melting of pure materials. Eutectic and eutectoid reactions, as well as the melting of an alloy that belongs to an isomorphous system, all represent incongruent transformations.
Intermediate phases are sometimes classified on the basis of whether they melt 
congruently or incongruently. The intermetallic compound Mg
2Pb melts congruently 
at the point designated M on the magnesium–lead phase diagram, Figure 9.20. For the nickel–titanium system, Figure 9.22, there is a congruent melting point for the 𝛾 solid 
solution that corresponds to the point of tangency for the pairs of liquidus and solidus lines, at 1310 °C and 44.9 wt% Ti. The peritectic reaction is an example of incongruent 
melting for an intermediate phase.congruent

284  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
It need not be assumed that phase diagrams exist only for metal–metal systems; in fact, 
phase diagrams that are very useful in the design and processing of ceramic systems have been experimentally determined for many of these materials. Ceramic phase diagrams are discussed in Section 12.7.
Phase diagrams have also been determined for metallic (as well as ceramic) 
systems containing more than two components; however, their representation and 
interpretation may be exceedingly complex. For example, a ternary, or three-component, composition–temperature phase diagram in its entirety is depicted by a three- dimensional model. Portrayal of features of the diagram or model in two dimensions is possible, but somewhat difficult.
The construction of phase diagrams—as well as some of the principles governing the conditions for phase equilibria—are dictated by laws of thermodynamics. One of these is the Gibbs phase rule, proposed by the nineteenth-century physicist J. Willard Gibbs. 
This rule represents a criterion for the number of phases that coexist within a system at equilibrium and is expressed by the simple equation
 
P+F=C+N (9.16)
where P is the number of phases present (the phase concept is discussed in Section 
9.3). The parameter F is termed the number of degrees of freedom  or the number of Gibbs phase rule

9.17 The Gibbs Phase Rule  •   285
externally controlled variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition) that must be 
specified to define the state of the system completely. Expressed another way, F is the 
number of these variables that can be changed independently without altering the num-ber of phases that coexist at equilibrium. The parameter C in Equation 9.16 represents 
the number of components in the system. Components are normally elements or stable compounds and, in the case of phase diagrams, are the materials at the two extremes of the horizontal compositional axis (e.g., H
2O and C12H22O11, and Cu and Ni for the phase 
diagrams shown in Figures 9.1 and 9.3 a, respectively). Finally, N in Equation 9.16 is the 
number of noncompositional variables (e.g., temperature and pressure).
Let us demonstrate the phase rule by applying it to binary temperature–composition 
phase diagrams, specifically the copper–silver system, Figure 9.7. Because pressure is constant (1 atm), the parameter N is 1—temperature is the only noncompositional vari-
able. Equation 9.16 now takes the form
 P+F=C+1 (9.17)
The number of components C is 2 (namely, Cu and Ag), and
P+F=2+1=3
or
F=3−P
Consider the case of single-phase fields on the phase diagram (e.g., 𝛼, 𝛽, and liquid 
regions). Because only one phase is present, P = 1 and
 F=3−P
 =3−1=2
This means that to completely describe the characteristics of any alloy that exists within 
one of these phase fields, we must specify two parameters—composition and tempera-ture, which locate, respectively, the horizontal and vertical positions of the alloy on the phase diagram.
For the situation in which two phases coexist—for example, 𝛼 + L, 𝛽 + L, and 𝛼 + 
𝛽 phase regions (Figure 9.7)—the phase rule stipulates that we have but one degree of 
freedom because
 F=3−P
 =3−2=1
Thus, it is necessary to specify either temperature or the composition of one of the phases to completely define the system. For example, suppose that we decide to specify temperature for the 𝛼 + L phase region, say, T
1 in Figure 9.23. The compositions of the 
𝛼 and liquid phases ( C𝛼 and CL) are thus dictated by the extremes of the tie line con-
structed at T1 across the 𝛼 + L field. Note that only the nature of the phases is important 
in this treatment and not the relative phase amounts. This is to say that the overall alloy composition could lie anywhere along this tie line constructed at temperature T
1 and still 
give C𝛼 and CL compositions for the respective 𝛼 and liquid phases.
The second alternative is to stipulate the composition of one of the phases for this 
two-phase situation, which thereby fixes completely the state of the system. For exam-ple, if we specified C
𝛼 as the composition of the 𝛼 phase that is in equilibrium with the 
liquid (Figure 9.23), then both the temperature of the alloy ( T1) and the composition of 
the liquid phase (CL) are established, again by the tie line drawn across the 𝛼 + L phase 
field so as to give this C𝛼 composition.
286  •   Chapter 9  /  Phase Diagrams
For binary systems, when three phases are present, there are no degrees of freedom 
because
 F=3−P
 =3−3=0
This means that the compositions of all three phases—as well as the temperature—are 
fixed. This condition is met for a eutectic system by the eutectic isotherm; for the Cu–Ag system (Figure 9.7), it is the horizontal line that extends between points B and G. At this 
temperature, 779 °C, the points at which each of the 𝛼, L, and 𝛽 phase fields touch the 
isotherm line correspond to the respective phase compositions; namely, the composition of the 𝛼 phase is fixed at 8.0 wt% Ag, that of the liquid at 71.9 wt% Ag, and that of the 𝛽 
phase at 91.2 wt% Ag. Thus, three-phase equilibrium is not represented by a phase field, but rather by the unique horizontal isotherm line. Furthermore, all three phases are in equilibrium for any alloy composition that lies along the length of the eutectic isotherm (e.g., for the Cu–Ag system at 779 °C and compositions between 8.0 and 91.2 wt% Ag).
One use of the Gibbs phase rule is in analyzing for nonequilibrium conditions. For 
example, a microstructure for a binary alloy that developed over a range of tempera-tures and consists of three phases is a nonequilibrium one; under these circumstances, three phases exist only at a single temperature.Composition (wt% Ag) (Cu)Temperature (°C)

values for the two remaining parameters are established by construction of the appropriate tie line.

also a variable. What is the maximum number of phases that may be present for a ternary sys-

9.18 The Iron–Iron Carbide (Fe–Fe3C) Phase Diagram  •   287
The Iron–Carbon System
Of all binary alloy systems, the one that is possibly the most important is that for iron 
and carbon. Both steels and cast irons, primary structural materials in every techno-logically advanced culture, are essentially iron–carbon alloys. This section is devoted to a study of the phase diagram for this system and the development of several of the possible microstructures. The relationships among heat treatment, microstructure, and mechanical properties are explored in Chapters 10 and 11.
A portion of the iron–carbon phase diagram is presented in Figure 9.24. Pure iron, upon heating, experiences two changes in crystal structure before it melts. At room temperature, the stable form, called ferrite, or 𝛼-iron, has a BCC crystal structure. 
Ferrite experiences a polymorphic transformation to FCC austenite, or 𝛾-iron, at 
912°C (1674 °F). This austenite persists to 1394 °C (2541 °F), at which temperature the 
FCC austenite reverts back to a BCC phase known as 𝛿-ferrite, which finally melts

at 1538 °C (2800 °F). All these changes are apparent along the left vertical axis of the 
phase diagram.4
The composition axis in Figure 9.24 extends only to 6.70 wt% C; at this concentra-
tion the intermediate compound iron carbide, or cementite (Fe3C), is formed, which 
is represented by a vertical line on the phase diagram. Thus, the iron–carbon system 
may be divided into two parts: an iron-rich portion, as in Figure 9.24, and the other (not shown) for compositions between 6.70 and 100 wt% C (pure graphite). In prac-tice, all steels and cast irons have carbon contents less than 6.70 wt% C; therefore, we consider only the iron–iron carbide system. Figure 9.24 would be more appropriately labeled the Fe–Fe
3C phase diagram because Fe3C is now considered to be a component. 
Convention and convenience dictate that composition still be expressed in “wt% C” rather than “wt% Fe
3C”; 6.70 wt% C corresponds to 100 wt% Fe3C.
Carbon is an interstitial impurity in iron and forms a solid solution with each of 
𝛼- and 𝛿-ferrites and also with austenite, as indicated by the 𝛼, 𝛿, and 𝛾 single-phase 
fields in Figure 9.24. In the BCC 𝛼-ferrite, only small concentrations of carbon are 
soluble; the maximum solubility is 0.022 wt% at 727 °C (1341 °F). The limited solubil-
ity is explained by the shape and size of the BCC interstitial positions, which make it difficult to accommodate the carbon atoms. Even though present in relatively low con-centrations, carbon significantly influences the mechanical properties of ferrite. This particular iron–carbon phase is relatively soft, may be made magnetic at temperatures below 768 °C (1414 °F), and has a density of 7.88 g/cm

graph of 𝛼-ferrite.

4The reader may wonder why no 𝛽 phase is found on the Fe–Fe3C phase diagram, Figure 9.24 (consistent with the 𝛼, 
𝛽, 𝛾, etc. labeling scheme described previously). Early investigators observed that the ferromagnetic behavior of iron 
disappears at 768 °C and attributed this phenomenon to a phase transformation; the “ 𝛽” label was assigned to the 
high-temperature phase. Later, it was discovered that this loss of magnetism did not result from a phase transforma-
tion (see Section 20.6) and, therefore, the presumed 𝛽 phase did not exist.
9.18 The Iron–Iron Carbide (Fe–Fe3C) Phase Diagram  •   289
in austenite, 2.14 wt%, occurs at 1147 °C (2097 °F). This solubility is approximately 100 
times greater than the maximum for BCC ferrite because the FCC octahedral sites are 
larger than the BCC tetrahedral sites (compare the results of Problems 4.8a and 4.9), and, therefore, the strains imposed on the surrounding iron atoms are much lower. As the discussions that follow demonstrate, phase transformations involving austenite are very important in the heat treating of steels. In passing, it should be mentioned that austenite is nonmagnetic. Figure 9.25 b shows a photomicrograph of this austenite phase.

The 𝛿-ferrite is virtually the same as 𝛼-ferrite, except for the range of temperatures 
over which each exists. Because the 𝛿-ferrite is stable only at relatively high tempera-
tures, it is of no technological importance and is not discussed further.
Cementite (Fe3C) forms when the solubility limit of carbon in 𝛼-ferrite is exceeded 
below 727 °C (1341 °F) (for compositions within the 𝛼 + Fe3C phase region). As indi-
cated in Figure 9.24, Fe3C also coexists with the 𝛾 phase between 727 °C and 1147 °C 
(1341 °F and 2097 °F). Mechanically, cementite is very hard and brittle; the strength of 
some steels is greatly enhanced by its presence.
Strictly speaking, cementite is only metastable; that is, it remains as a compound in-
definitely at room temperature. However, if heated to between 650 °C and 700 °C (1200 °F 
and 1300 °F) for several years, it gradually changes or transforms into 𝛼-iron and carbon, in 
the form of graphite, which remains upon subsequent cooling to room temperature. Thus, the phase diagram in Figure 9.24 is not a true equilibrium one because cementite is not an equilibrium compound. However, because the decomposition rate of cementite is extremely sluggish, virtually all the carbon in steel is as Fe
3C instead of graphite, and the iron–iron 
carbide phase diagram is, for all practical purposes, valid. As will be seen in Section 11.2, addition of silicon to cast irons greatly accelerates this cementite decomposition reaction to form graphite.
The two-phase regions are labeled in Figure 9.24. It may be noted that one eutectic 
exists for the iron–iron carbide system, at 4.30 wt% C and 1147 °C (2097 °F); for this 
eutectic reaction,
 
L⇌cooling
heating𝛾+Fe3C  (9.18)
the liquid solidifies to form austenite and cementite phases. Subsequent cooling to room 
temperature promotes additional phase changes.
It may be noted that a eutectoid invariant point exists at a composition of 0.76 wt% 
C and a temperature of 727 °C (1341 °F). This eutectoid reaction may be represented by
 𝛾(0.76 wt% C) ⇌cooling
heating𝛼(0.022 wt% C) +Fe3C(6.7 wt% C)  (9.19)
or, upon cooling, the solid 𝛾 phase is transformed into 𝛼-iron and cementite. (Eutectoid 
phase transformations were addressed in Section 9.14.) The eutectoid phase changes described by Equation 9.19 are very important, being fundamental to the heat treatment of steels, as explained in subsequent discussions.
Ferrous alloys are those in which iron is the prime component, but carbon as well 
as other alloying elements may be present. In the classification scheme of ferrous alloys based on carbon content, there are three types: iron, steel, and cast iron. Commercially pure iron contains less than 0.008 wt% C and, from the phase diagram, is composed almost exclusively of the ferrite phase at room temperature. The iron–carbon alloys Tutorial Video:

that contain between 0.008 and 2.14 wt% C are classified as steels. In most steels, the 
microstructure consists of both 𝛼 and Fe3C phases. Upon cooling to room temperature, 
an alloy within this composition range must pass through at least a portion of the 𝛾-phase field; distinctive microstructures are subsequently produced, as discussed 
shortly. Although a steel alloy may contain as much as 2.14 wt% C, in practice, carbon concentrations rarely exceed 1.0 wt%. The properties and various classifications of steels are treated in Section 11.2. Cast irons are classified as ferrous alloys that contain between 2.14 and 6.70 wt% C. However, commercial cast irons normally contain less than 4.5 wt% C. These alloys are discussed further in Section 11.2.
Several of the various microstructures that may be produced in steel alloys and their relationships to the iron–iron carbon phase diagram are now discussed, and it is shown that the microstructure that develops depends on both the carbon content and heat treatment. This discussion is confined to very slow cooling of steel alloys, in which equi-librium is continuously maintained. A more detailed exploration of the influence of heat treatment on microstructure, and ultimately on the mechanical properties of steels, is contained in Chapter 10.
Phase changes that occur upon passing from the 𝛾 region into the 𝛼 + Fe
3C phase 
field (Figure 9.24) are relatively complex and similar to those described for the eu-tectic systems in Section 9.12. Consider, for example, an alloy of eutectoid composi-tion (0.76 wt% C) as it is cooled from a temperature within the 𝛾-phase region, say, 
800°C—that is, beginning at point a  in Figure 9.26 and moving down the vertical line 9.19  DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN

As the alloy is cooled, no changes occur until the eutectoid temperature (727 °C) is

ing to Equation 9.19.
The microstructure for this eutectoid steel that is slowly cooled through the eu-
tectoid temperature consists of alternating layers or lamellae of the two phases ( 𝛼 and 
Fe3C) that form simultaneously during the transformation. In this case, the relative 
layer thickness is approximately 8 to 1. This microstructure, represented schematically in Figure 9.26, point b, is called pearlite because it has the appearance of mother-of-
pearl when viewed under the microscope at low magnifications. Figure 9.27 is a pho-tomicrograph of a eutectoid steel showing the pearlite. The pearlite exists as grains, often termed colonies; within each colony the layers are oriented in essentially the same direction, which varies from one colony to another. The thick light layers are the ferrite phase, and the cementite phase appears as thin lamellae, most of which appear dark. Many cementite layers are so thin that adjacent phase boundaries are so close to-gether that they are indistinguishable at this magnification and, therefore, appear dark. Mechanically, pearlite has properties intermediate between those of the soft, ductile ferrite and the hard, brittle cementite.
The alternating 𝛼 and Fe
3C layers in pearlite form for the same reason that the 
eutectic structure (Figures 9.13 and 9.14) forms—because the composition of the par-ent phase [in this case, austenite (0.76 wt% C)] is different from that of either of the product phases [ferrite (0.022 wt% C) and cementite (6.70 wt% C)], and the phase transformation requires that there be a redistribution of the carbon by diffusion. Figure 9.28 illustrates microstructural changes that accompany this eutectoid reaction; here, the directions of carbon diffusion are indicated by arrows. Carbon atoms diffuse away from the 0.022-wt% ferrite regions and to the 6.70-wt% cementite layers, as the pearlite ex-tends from the grain boundary into the unreacted austenite grain. The layered pearlite forms because carbon atoms need diffuse only minimal distances with the formation of this structure.
Subsequent cooling of the pearlite from point b in Figure 9.26 produces relatively 
insignificant microstructural changes.pearliteFigure 9.27  Photomicrograph of a

Hypoeutectoid Alloys
Microstructures for iron–iron carbide alloys having other than the eutectoid composition 
are now explored; these are analogous to the fourth case described in Section 9.12 and illustrated in Figure 9.16 for the eutectic system. Consider a composition C
0 to the left of 
the eutectoid, between 0.022 and 0.76 wt% C; this is termed a hypoeutectoid (“less than 
eutectoid”) alloy. Cooling an alloy of this composition is represented by moving down 
the vertical line yyʹ  in Figure 9.29. At about 875 °C, point c , the microstructure consists hypoeutectoid alloyFigure 9.28  Schematic

entirely of grains of the 𝛾 phase, as shown schematically in the figure. In cooling to 
point d, about 775 °C, which is within the 𝛼 + 𝛾 phase region, both these phases coexist 
as in the schematic microstructure. Most of the small 𝛼 particles form along the original 
𝛾 grain boundaries. The compositions of both 𝛼 and 𝛾 phases may be determined using 
the appropriate tie line; these compositions correspond, respectively, to about 0.020 and 
0.40 wt% C.
While cooling an alloy through the 𝛼 + 𝛾 phase region, the composition of the 
ferrite phase changes with temperature along the 𝛼–(𝛼 + 𝛾) phase boundary, line MN, 
becoming slightly richer in carbon. However, the change in composition of the austenite is more dramatic, proceeding along the ( 𝛼 + 𝛾)–𝛾 boundary, line MO, as the tempera-
ture is reduced.
Cooling from point d  to e , just above the eutectoid but still in the 𝛼 + 𝛾 region, 
produces an increased fraction of the 𝛼 phase and a microstructure similar to that also 
shown: the 𝛼 particles will have grown larger. At this point, the compositions of the 
𝛼 and 𝛾 phases are determined by constructing a tie line at the temperature T
e; the 
𝛼 phase contains 0.022 wt% C, whereas the 𝛾 phase is of the eutectoid composition, 
0.76 wt% C.
As the temperature is lowered just below the eutectoid, to point f , all of the 
𝛾 phase that was present at temperature Te (and having the eutectoid composi-
tion) transforms into pearlite, according to the reaction in Equation 9.19. There is virtually no change in the 𝛼 phase that existed at point e  in crossing the eutectoid 
temperature—it is normally present as a continuous matrix phase surrounding the isolated pearlite colonies. The microstructure at point f appears as the corre-
sponding schematic inset of Figure 9.29. Thus the ferrite phase is present both in the pearlite and as the phase that formed while cooling through the 𝛼 + 𝛾 phase 
region. The ferrite present in the pearlite is called eutectoid ferrite, whereas the other, which formed above T
e, is termed proeutectoid (meaning “pre- or before 
eutectoid”) ferrite, as labeled in Figure 9.29. Figure 9.30 is a photomicrograph of a 
0.38-wt% C steel; large, white regions correspond to the proeutectoid ferrite. For pearlite, the spacing between the 𝛼 and Fe
3C layers varies from grain to grain; some proeutectoid ferrite

of the pearlite appears dark because the many close-spaced layers are unresolved 
at the magnification of the photomicrograph. Note that two microconstituents are present in this micrograph—proeutectoid ferrite and pearlite—which appear in all hypoeutectoid iron–carbon alloys that are slowly cooled to a temperature below the eutectoid.
The relative amounts of the proeutectoid 𝛼 and pearlite may be determined in a man-
ner similar to that described in Section 9.12 for primary and eutectic microconstituents. We use the lever rule in conjunction with a tie line that extends from the 𝛼–(𝛼 + Fe
3C) 
phase boundary (0.022-wt% C) to the eutectoid composition (0.76-wt% C) inasmuch as pearlite is the transformation product of austenite having this composition. For example, let us consider an alloy of composition C
0′ in Figure 9.31. The fraction of pearlite, Wp, may 
be determined according to

Hypereutectoid Alloys
Analogous transformations and microstructures result for hypereutectoid alloys —
those containing between 0.76 and 2.14 wt% C—that are cooled from temperatures 
within the 𝛾-phase field. Consider an alloy of composition C1 in Figure 9.32 that, 
upon cooling, moves down the line zzʹ . At point g , only the 𝛾 phase is present with a 
composition of C1; the microstructure appears as shown, having only 𝛾 grains. Upon 
cooling into the 𝛾 + Fe3C phase field—say, to point h —the cementite phase begins 
to form along the initial 𝛾 grain boundaries, similar to the 𝛼 phase in Figure 9.29, 
point d. This cementite is called proeutectoid cementite —that which forms before 
the eutectoid reaction. The cementite composition remains constant (6.70 wt% C) as the temperature changes. However, the composition of the austenite phase moves along line PO toward the eutectoid. As the temperature is lowered through the eutectoid to point i , all remaining austenite of eutectoid composition is converted 
into pearlite; thus, the resulting microstructure consists of pearlite and proeutectoid cementite as microconstituents (Figure 9.32). In the photomicrograph of a 1.4-wt% C steel (Figure 9.33), note that the proeutectoid cementite appears light. Because it has much the same appearance as proeutectoid ferrite (Figure 9.30), there is some difficulty in distinguishing between hypoeutectoid and hypereutectoid steels on the basis of microstructure.
Relative amounts of both pearlite and proeutectoid Fe
3C microconstituents 
may be computed for hypereutectoid steel alloys in a manner analogous to that for hypoeutectoid materials; the appropriate tie line extends between 0.76 and 6.70 wt% C. hypereutectoid alloy

Solution
(a)  This part of the problem is solved by applying the lever rule expressions using a tie 
line that extends all the way across the 𝛼 + Fe3C phase field. Thus, C0′ is 0.35 wt% 
C, and
W𝛼=6.70 −0.35
6.70 −0.022=0.95
and
WFe3C=0.35 −0.022
6.70 −0.022=0.05
(b)  The fractions of proeutectoid ferrite and pearlite are determined by using the lever rule 
and a tie line that extends only to the eutectoid composition (i.e., Equations 9.20 and 9.21). 
We have
Wp=0.35 −0.022
0.76 −0.022=0.44
and
W𝛼′=0.76 −0.35
0.76 −0.022=0.56
(c)  All ferrite is either as proeutectoid or eutectoid (in the pearlite). Therefore, the sum of 
these two ferrite fractions equals the fraction of total ferrite; that is,
W𝛼′+W𝛼e=W𝛼
where W𝛼e denotes the fraction of the total alloy that is eutectoid ferrite. Values for W𝛼 and 
W𝛼′ were determined in parts (a) and (b) as 0.95 and 0.56, respectively. Therefore,
W𝛼e=W𝛼−W𝛼′=0.95 −0.56 =0.39
Nonequilibrium Cooling
In this discussion of the microstructural development of iron–carbon alloys, it has been assumed that, upon cooling, conditions of metastable equilibrium
6 have been continu-
ously maintained; that is, sufficient time has been allowed at each new temperature for any necessary adjustment in phase compositions and relative amounts as predicted from the Fe–Fe
3C phase diagram. In most situations these cooling rates are impracti-
cally slow and unnecessary; in fact, on many occasions nonequilibrium conditions are desirable. Two nonequilibrium effects of practical importance are (1) the occurrence of phase changes or transformations at temperatures other than those predicted by phase boundary lines on the phase diagram, and (2) the existence at room temperature of nonequilibrium phases that do not appear on the phase diagram. Both are discussed in Chapter 10.
6The term metastable equilibrium is used in this discussion because Fe3C is only a metastable compound.

Additions of other alloying elements (Cr, Ni, Ti, etc.) bring about rather dramatic 
changes in the binary iron–iron carbide phase diagram, Figure 9.24. The extent of these alterations of the positions of phase boundaries and the shapes of the phase fields de-pends on the particular alloying element and its concentration. One of the important changes is the shift in position of the eutectoid with respect to temperature and carbon concentration. These effects are illustrated in Figures 9.34 and 9.35, which plot the eu-tectoid temperature and eutectoid composition (in wt% C), respectively, as a function of concentration for several other alloying elements. Thus, other alloy additions alter not only the temperature of the eutectoid reaction, but also the relative fractions of pearlite and the proeutectoid phase that form. Steels are normally alloyed for other reasons, however—usually either to improve their corrosion resistance or to render them amena-ble to heat treatment (see Section 11.8).9.20  THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER

SUMMARY
• Equilibrium phase diagrams are a convenient and concise way of representing the 
most stable relationships between phases in alloy systems.
• A phase is some portion of a body of material throughout which the physical and 
chemical characteristics are homogeneous.

• A system at equilibrium is in its most stable state—that is, its phase characteristics do 
not change over time. 
• Metastable systems are nonequilibrium ones that persist indefinitely and experience 
imperceptible changes with time.
• For one-component phase diagrams, the logarithm of the pressure is plotted versus the 
temperature; solid-, liquid-, and vapor-phase regions are found on this type of diagram.
• For binary systems, temperature and composition are variables, whereas external 
pressure is held constant. Areas, or phase regions, are defined on these temperature-versus-composition plots within which either one or two phases exist.
• Isomorphous diagrams are those for which there is complete solubility in the solid 
phase; the copper–nickel system (Figure 9.3 a) displays this behavior.
• For an alloy of specified composition at a known temperature and that is at equilib-
rium, the following may be determined:
What phase(s) is (are) present—from the location of the temperature–composition 
point on the phase diagram.
Phase composition(s)—a horizontal tie line is used for the two-phase situation.
Phase mass fraction(s)—the lever rule [which uses tie-line segment lengths 
(Equations 9.1 and 9.2)] is used in two-phase regions.
• In a eutectic reaction, as found in some alloy systems, a liquid phase transforms iso-
thermally into two different solid phases upon cooling (i.e., L 
→ 𝛼 + 𝛽).
• The solubility limit at some temperature corresponds to the maximum concentration 
of one component that will go into solution in a specific phase. For a binary eutectic 
system, solubility limits are to be found along solidus and solvus phase boundaries.
• The solidification of an alloy (liquid) of eutectic composition yields a microstructure 
consisting of layers of the two solid phases that alternate.
• A primary (or pre-eutectic) phase and the layered eutectic structure are the solidification 
products for all compositions (other than the eutectic) that lie along the eutectic isotherm.
• Other equilibrium diagrams are more complex, in that they may have phases/
solid solutions/compounds that do not lie at the concentration (i.e., horizontal) extremes on the diagram. These include intermediate solid solutions and interme-tallic compounds.
• In addition to the eutectic, other invariant reactions involving three phases may occur 
at specific points on a phase diagram:
For a eutectoid reaction, upon cooling, one solid phase transforms into two other 
solid phases (e.g., 𝛼 
→ 𝛽 + 𝛾).
For a peritectic reaction, upon cooling, a liquid and one solid phase transform 
into another solid phase (e.g., L + 𝛼 → 𝛽).
• A transformation in which there is no change in composition for the phases involved 
is congruent.Phase Equilibria

• The Gibbs phase rule is a simple equation (Equation 9.16 in its most general form) 
that relates the number of phases present in a system at equilibrium with the number 
of degrees of freedom, the number of components, and the number of noncomposi-tional variables.
• Important phases found on the iron–iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 9.24) are 
𝛼-ferrite (BCC), 𝛾-austenite (FCC), and the intermetallic compound iron carbide [or 
cementite (Fe
3C)].
• On the basis of composition, ferrous alloys fall into three classifications:
Irons (<0.008 wt% C)Steels (0.008 to 2.14 wt% C)Cast irons (>2.14 wt% C)
• The development of microstructure for many iron–carbon alloys and steels depends 
on a eutectoid reaction in which the austenite phase of composition 0.76 wt% C transforms isothermally (at 727 °C) into 𝛼-ferrite (0.022 wt% C) and cementite (i.e., 
𝛾 
→ 𝛼 + Fe3C).
• The microstructural product of an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition is 
pearlite, a microconstituent consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite.
• The microstructures of alloys having carbon contents less than the eutectoid (i.e., 
hypoeutectoid alloys) are composed of a proeutectoid ferrite phase in addition to pearlite.
• Pearlite and proeutectoid cementite constitute the microconstituents for hypereutec-
toid alloys—those with carbon contents in excess of the eutectoid composition.The Gibbs Phase

T wo pressure–temperature phase diagrams are shown: for H2O (top) and CO2 (bot-
tom). Phase transformations occur when phase boundaries (the red curves) on these plots 
are crossed as temperature and/or pressure is changed. For example, ice melts (transforms 
to liquid water) upon heating, which corresponds to crossing the solid–liquid phase boundary, as rep-resented by the arrow on the H
2O phase diagram. 
Similarly, upon passing across the solid–gas phase boundary of the CO
2 phase diagram, dry ice (solid 
CO2) sublimes (transforms into gaseous CO2). Again,

WHY STUDY Phase Transformations?
One reason metallic materials are so versatile is that their mechanical properties 
(strength, hardness, ductility, etc.) are subject to control and management over relatively large ranges. Three strengthening mechanisms were discussed in Chapter 7—namely grain size refinement, solid-solution strengthening, and strain hardening. Additional techniques are available in which the mechanical behavior of a metal alloy is influenced by its microstructure. The development of microstructure in both single- and two-phase alloys typically involves some type of phase transformation—an alteration in the number and/or char-acter of the phases. The first portion of this chapter is devoted to a brief discussion of some of the basic principles relating to transformations involving solid phases. Because most phase transformations do not occur instantaneously, consideration is given to the dependence of reaction progress on time, or the transformation rate. This is followed 
by a discussion of the development of two-phase microstructures for iron–carbon alloys. Modified phase diagrams are introduced that permit determination of the microstruc-ture that results from a specific heat treatment. Finally, other microconstituents in addi-tion to pearlite are presented and, for each, the mechanical properties are discussed.
transformation rate
A variety of phase transformations are important in the processing of materials, and usually they involve some alteration of the microstructure. For purposes of this dis-cussion, these transformations are divided into three classifications. In one group are phase transformation10.1 INTRODUCTION
10.2 BASIC CONCEPTSLearning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Make a schematic fraction transformation-
versus-logarithm of time plot for a typical solid–
solid transformation; cite the equation that describes this behavior.
2.  Briefly describe the microstructure for each of 
the following microconstituents that are found in steel alloys: fine pearlite, coarse pearlite, spheroidite, bainite, martensite, and tempered martensite.3.  Cite the general mechanical characteristics for 
each of the following microconstituents: fine pearlite, coarse pearlite, spheroidite, bainite, martensite, and tempered martensite; briefly explain these behaviors in terms of microstruc-ture (or crystal structure).
4.  Given the isothermal transformation (or 
 continuous-cooling transformation) diagram for some iron–carbon alloy, design a heat treatment that will produce a specified microstructure.
Phase TransformationsThe development of a set of desirable mechanical characteristics for a material often results from a phase transformation that is wrought by a heat treatment. The time and temperature dependen-cies of some phase transformations are conveniently represented on modified phase diagrams. It is impor-tant to know how to use these diagrams in order to design a heat  treatment for some alloy that will yield the desired room-temperature mechanical proper-ties. For example, the tensile strength of an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition (0.76 wt% C) can be varied between  approximately 700 MPa (100,000 psi) and 2000 MPa (300,000 psi) depending on the heat treatment employed.

simple diffusion-dependent transformations in which there is no change in either the 
number or composition of the phases present. These include solidification of a pure metal, allotropic transformations, and recrystallization and grain growth (see Sections 7.12 and 7.13). In another type of diffusion-dependent transformation, there is some alteration in phase compositions and often in the number of phases present; the final microstructure typically consists of two phases. The eutectoid reaction described by Equation 9.19 is of this type; it receives further attention in Section 10.5. The third kind of transformation is diffusionless, in which a metastable phase is pro-duced. As discussed in Section 10.5, a martensitic transformation, which may be induced in some steel alloys, falls into this category.
With phase transformations, normally at least one new phase is formed that has dif-ferent physical/chemical characteristics and/or a different structure than the parent phase. Furthermore, most phase transformations do not occur instantaneously. Rather, they begin by the formation of numerous small particles of the new phase(s), which in-crease in size until the transformation has reached completion. The progress of a phase transformation may be broken down into two distinct stages: nucleation and growth. 
Nucleation involves the appearance of very small particles, or nuclei of the new phase (often consisting of only a few hundred atoms), which are capable of growing. During the growth stage, these nuclei increase in size, which results in the disappearance of some (or all) of the parent phase. The transformation reaches completion if the growth of these new-phase particles is allowed to proceed until the equilibrium fraction is at-tained. We now discuss the mechanics of these two processes and how they relate to solid-state transformations.
Nucleation
There are two types of nucleation: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The distinction 
between them is made according to the site at which nucleating events occur. For the homogeneous type, nuclei of the new phase form uniformly throughout the parent phase, whereas for the heterogeneous type, nuclei form preferentially at structural inhomogeneities, such as container surfaces, insoluble impurities, grain boundaries, and dislocations. We begin by discussing homogeneous nucleation because its description and theory are simpler to treat. These principles are then extended to a discussion of the heterogeneous type.
Homogeneous Nucleation
 A discussion of the theory of nucleation involves a thermodynamic parameter called free energy (or Gibbs free energy), G. In brief, free energy is a function of other 
thermodynamic parameters, of which one is the internal energy of the system (i.e., the enthalpy, H) and another is a measurement of the randomness or disorder of the atoms or molecules (i.e., the entropy, S). It is not our purpose here to provide a detailed discus-sion of the principles of thermodynamics as they apply to materials systems. However, relative to phase transformations, an important thermodynamic parameter is the change in free energy ΔG; a transformation occurs spontaneously only when ΔG has a nega-
tive value. For the sake of simplicity, let us first consider the solidification of a pure material, assuming that nuclei of the solid phase form in the interior of the liquid as atoms cluster together so as to form a packing arrangement similar to that found in the solid phase. nucleation, growth

It will be assumed that each nucleus is spherical and has a radius r. This situation is 
represented schematically in Figure 10.1.
 There are two contributions to the total free energy change that accompany a so-lidification transformation. The first is the free energy difference between the solid and liquid phases, or the volume free energy, ΔG
𝜐. Its value is negative if the temperature is 
below the equilibrium solidification temperature, and the magnitude of its contribution is the product of ΔG
𝜐 and the volume of the spherical nucleus (i.e., 4
3𝜋r3). The second en-
ergy contribution results from the formation of the solid–liquid phase boundary during the solidification transformation. Associated with this boundary is a surface free energy, 
𝛾, which is positive; furthermore, the magnitude of this contribution is the product of 𝛾
and the surface area of the nucleus (i.e., 4 𝜋r
2). Finally, the total free energy change is 
equal to the sum of these two contributions:
 ΔG=4
3𝜋r3ΔG𝜐+4𝜋r2𝛾 (10.1)
These volume, surface, and total free energy contributions are plotted schematically 
as a function of nucleus radius in Figures 10.2a and 10.2b. Figure 10.2a shows that for the curve corresponding to the first term on the right-hand side of Equation 10.1, the free energy (which is negative) decreases with the third power of r. Furthermore, for 
the curve resulting from the second term in Equation 10.1, energy values are positive and increase with the square of the radius. Consequently, the curve associated with the Total free energy

sum of both terms (Figure 10.2 b) first increases, passes through a maximum, and finally 
decreases. In a physical sense, this means that as a solid particle begins to form as atoms 
in the liquid cluster together, its free energy first increases. If this cluster reaches a size corresponding to the critical radius r*, then growth will continue with the accompani-
ment of a decrease in free energy. However, a cluster of radius less than the critical value will shrink and redissolve. This subcritical particle is an embryo, and the particle 
of radius greater than r* is termed a nucleus. A critical free energy, ΔG*, occurs at the 
critical radius and, consequently, at the maximum of the curve in Figure 10.2 b. This ΔG* 
corresponds to an activation free energy, which is the free energy required for the formation of a stable nucleus. Equivalently, it may be considered an energy barrier to the nucleation process. Because r* and ΔG* appear at the maximum on the free energy-versus-radius curve 
of Figure 10.2b, derivation of expressions for these two parameters is a simple matter. For r*, we differentiate the ΔG equation (Equation 10.1) with respect to r, set the result-
ing expression equal to zero, and then solve for r (= r*). That is,
 d(ΔG)

3𝜋 ΔG𝜐(3r2)+4𝜋𝛾(2r)=0 (10.2)
which leads to the result

Now, substitution of this expression for r* into Equation 10.1 yields the following 
 expression for ΔG*:
 ΔG*=16𝜋𝛾3

 This volume free energy change ΔG𝜐 is the driving force for the solidification trans-
formation, and its magnitude is a function of temperature. At the equilibrium solidifica-
tion temperature Tm, the value of ΔG𝜐 is zero, and with decreasing temperature its value 
becomes increasingly more negative. It can be shown that ΔG
𝜐 is a function of temperature as
 ΔG𝜐=ΔHf(Tm−T)
Tm (10.5)
where ΔHf is the latent heat of fusion (i.e., the heat given up during solidification), and 
Tm and the temperature T are in Kelvin. Substitution of this expression for ΔG𝜐 into 
Equations 10.3 and 10.4 yields

expressions are relatively insensitive to temperature changes.) Figure 10.3, a schematic 
ΔG-versus-r plot that shows curves for two different temperatures, illustrates these re-
lationships. Physically, this means that with a lowering of temperature at temperatures 
below the equilibrium solidification temperature ( Tm), nucleation occurs more readily. 
Furthermore, the number of stable nuclei n* (having radii greater than r*) is a function 
of temperature as
 n*=K1 exp(−ΔG*
kT) (10.8)
where the constant K1 is related to the total number of nuclei of the solid phase. 
For the exponential term of this expression, changes in temperature have a greater 
effect on the magnitude of the ΔG* term in the numerator than the T  term in the 
denominator. Consequently, as the temperature is lowered below Tm, the exponen-
tial term in Equation 10.8 also decreases, so that the magnitude of n * increases. 
This temperature dependence (n * versus T ) is represented in the schematic plot of 
Figure 10.4a .
 Another important temperature-dependent step is involved in and also influences nucleation: the clustering of atoms by short-range diffusion during the formation of nuclei. The influence of temperature on the rate of diffusion (i.e., magnitude of the diffusion coefficient, D) is given in Equation 5.8. Furthermore, this diffusion effect 
is related to the frequency at which atoms from the liquid attach themselves to the Figure 10.3  Schematic free

solid nucleus, vd. The dependence of vd on temperature is the same as for the diffusion 
coefficient— namely,
 vd=K2 exp(− Qd
kT) (10.9)
where Qd is a temperature-independent parameter—the activation energy for diffusion— 
and K2 is a temperature-independent constant. Thus, from Equation 10.9, a decrease of 
temperature results in a reduction in vd. This effect, represented by the curve shown in 
Figure 10.4b, is just the reverse of that for n* as discussed earlier.
 The principles and concepts just developed are now extended to a discussion of another important nucleation parameter, the nucleation rate 
N∙ (which has units of 
 nuclei per unit volume per second). This rate is simply proportional to the product of n* (Equation 10.8) and v
d (Equation 10.9)—that is,
 N∙=K3n*vd=K1K2K3[exp(− ΔG*
kT)exp(− Qd
kT)] (10.10)
Here, K3 is the number of atoms on a nucleus surface. Figure 10.4 c schematically plots 
nucleation rate as a function of temperature and, in addition, the curves of Figures 10.4 a 
and 10.4b from which the N∙ curve is derived. Figure 10.4c shows that, with a reduction 
of temperature from below Tm, the nucleation rate first increases, achieves a maximum, 
and subsequently diminishes. The shape of this 
N∙ curve is explained as follows: for the upper region of the 
curve (a sudden and dramatic increase in N∙ with decreasing T ), ΔG* is greater than 
Qd, which means that the exp( −ΔG*/kT) term of Equation 10.10 is much smaller than 
exp( −Qd /kT). In other words, the nucleation rate is suppressed at high temperatures 
because of a small activation driving force. With continued reduction of temperature, there comes a point at which ΔG* becomes smaller than the temperature-independent 
Q
d, with the result that exp( −Qd/kT) < exp( −ΔG*/kT), or that, at lower temperatures, 
a low atomic mobility suppresses the nucleation rate. This accounts for the shape of the lower curve segment (a precipitous reduction of 
N∙ with a continued reduction of 
temperature). Furthermore, the N∙ curve of Figure 10.4c  necessarily passes through a 
maximum over the intermediate temperature range, where values for ΔG* and Qd are 
of approximately the same magnitude. Several qualifying comments are in order regarding the preceding discussion. First, although we assumed a spherical shape for nuclei, this method may be applied to any shape with the same final result. Furthermore, this treatment may be used for types of transformations other than solidification (i.e., liquid–solid)—for example, solid–vapor and solid–solid. However, magnitudes of ΔG
𝜐 and 𝛾, in addition to diffusion rates of 
the atomic species, will undoubtedly differ among the various transformation types. In addition, for solid–solid transformations, there may be volume changes attendant to the formation of new phases. These changes may lead to the introduction of microscopic strains, which must be taken into account in the ΔG expression of Equation 10.1 and, 
consequently, will affect the magnitudes of r* and ΔG*.
 From Figure 10.4c it is apparent that during the cooling of a liquid, an appreciable nucleation rate (i.e., solidification) will begin only after the temperature has been low-ered to below the equilibrium solidification (or melting) temperature ( T
m). This phe-
nomenon is termed supercooling (or undercooling), and the degree of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation may be significant (on the order of several hundred degrees Kelvin) for some systems. Table 10.1 shows, for several materials, typical degrees of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation.Nucleation rate

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.1
Computation of Critical Nucleus Radius and Activation Free Energy
(a) For the solidification of pure gold, calculate the critical radius r* and the activation free 
energy ΔG* if nucleation is homogeneous. Values for the latent heat of fusion and surface 
free energy are −1.16 × 109 J/m3 and 0.132 J/m2, respectively. Use the supercooling value 
in Table 10.1.
(b) Now, calculate the number of atoms found in a nucleus of critical size. Assume a lattice 
parameter of 0.413 nm for solid gold at its melting temperature.
Solution
(a) In order to compute the critical radius, we employ Equation 10.6, using the melting tem-perature of 1064 °C for gold, assuming a supercooling value of 230 °C (Table 10.1), and 
realizing that ΔH

(b) In order to compute the number of atoms in a nucleus of critical size (assuming a spherical 
nucleus of radius r*), it is first necessary to determine the number of unit cells, which we then multiply by the number of atoms per unit cell. The number of unit cells found in this critical nucleus is just the ratio of critical nucleus and unit cell volumes. Inasmuch as gold has the FCC crystal structure (and a cubic unit cell), its unit cell volume is just a

a is the lattice parameter (i.e., unit cell edge length); its value is 0.413 nm, as cited in the

 Because of the equivalence of four atoms per FCC unit cell (Section 3.4), the total number 
of atoms per critical nucleus is just
 (137 unit cells/critical nucleus)(4 atoms/unit cell) = 548 atoms/critical nucleus
Heterogeneous Nucleation
 Although levels of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation may be significant (on occasion several hundred degrees Celsius), in practical situations they are often on the order of only several degrees Celsius. The reason for this is that the activation energy (i.e., energy barrier) for nucleation ( ΔG* of Equation 10.4) is lowered when nuclei form 
on preexisting surfaces or interfaces, because the surface free energy ( 𝛾 of Equation 
10.4) is reduced. In other words, it is easier for nucleation to occur at surfaces and inter-faces than at other sites. Again, this type of nucleation is termed heterogeneous.
 In order to understand this phenomenon, let us consider the nucleation, on a flat surface, of a solid particle from a liquid phase. It is assumed that both the liquid and solid phases “wet” this flat surface—that is, both of these phases spread out and cover the surface; this configuration is depicted schematically in Figure 10.5. Also noted in the figure are three interfacial energies (represented as vectors) that exist at two-phase boundaries— 𝛾
SL, 𝛾SI, and 𝛾IL—as well as the wetting angle 𝜃 (the angle between the 𝛾SI 
and 𝛾SL vectors). Taking a surface tension force balance in the plane of the flat surface 
leads to the following expression:
 𝛾IL=𝛾SI+𝛾SLcos  𝜃 (10.12)
 Now, using a somewhat involved procedure similar to the one presented for homo-
geneous nucleation (which we have chosen to omit), it is possible to derive equations for r* and ΔG*; these are as follows:

312  •   Chapter 10  /  Phase Transformations
The S(𝜃) term of this last equation is a function only of 𝜃 (i.e., the shape of the nucleus), 
which has a numerical value between zero and unity.1
 From Equation 10.13, it is important to note that the critical radius r* for heteroge-
neous nucleation is the same as for homogeneous nucleation, inasmuch as 𝛾SL is the same 
surface energy as 𝛾 in Equation 10.3. It is also evident that the activation energy barrier 
for heterogeneous nucleation (Equation 10.14) is smaller than the homogeneous barrier 
(Equation 10.4) by an amount corresponding to the value of this S(𝜃) function, or
 ΔG*het=ΔG*hom S(𝜃) (10.15)
Figure 10.6, a schematic graph of ΔG versus nucleus radius, plots curves for both types 
of nucleation and indicates the difference in the magnitudes of ΔG*het and ΔG*hom, in ad-
dition to the constancy of r*. This lower ΔG* for heterogeneous nucleation means that a 
smaller energy must be overcome during the nucleation process (than for homogeneous nucleation), and, therefore, heterogeneous nucleation occurs more readily (Equation 10.10). In terms of the nucleation rate, the 
N∙-versus-T curve (Figure 10.4c) is shifted to 
higher temperatures for heterogeneous. This effect is represented in Figure 10.7, which also shows that a much smaller degree of supercooling ( ΔT) is required for heterogene-
ous nucleation.

Growth
The growth step in a phase transformation begins once an embryo has exceeded the 
critical size, r*, and becomes a stable nucleus. Note that nucleation will continue to oc-cur simultaneously with growth of the new-phase particles; of course, nucleation cannot occur in regions that have already transformed into the new phase. Furthermore, the growth process will cease in any region where particles of the new phase meet because here the transformation will have reached completion. Particle growth occurs by long-range atomic diffusion, which normally involves sev-eral steps—for example, diffusion through the parent phase, across a phase boundary, and then into the nucleus. Consequently, the growth rate G
∙ is determined by the rate 
of diffusion, and its temperature dependence is the same as for the diffusion coefficient (Equation 5.8)—namely,
 
G∙=C exp(− Q
kT) (10.16)
where Q (the activation energy) and C  (a preexponential) are independent of temperature.2 
The temperature dependence of G∙ is represented by one of the curves in Figure 10.8; also 
shown is a curve for the nucleation rate, N∙ (again, almost always the rate for heterogeneous 
nucleation). Now, at a specific temperature, the overall transformation rate is equal to some 
product of N∙ and G∙. The third curve of Figure 10.8, which is for the total rate, represents 
this combined effect. The general shape of this curve is the same as for the nucleation rate, in that it has a peak or maximum that has been shifted upward relative to the 
N∙ curve.
 Whereas this treatment on transformations has been developed for solidification, the same general principles also apply to solid–solid and solid–gas transformations. As we shall see later, the rate of transformation and the time required for the transfor-mation to proceed to some degree of completion (e.g., time to 50% reaction completion, t
0.5) 
are inversely proportional to one another (Equation 10.18). Thus, if the logarithm of this transformation time (i.e., log t
0.5) is plotted versus temperature, a curve having the general 
shape shown in Figure 10.9b  results. This “C-shaped” curve is a virtual mirror image (through 
a vertical plane) of the transformation rate curve of Figure 10.8, as demonstrated in Figure 10.9. The kinetics of phase transformations are often represented using logarithm time (to some degree of transformation) versus-temperature plots (for example, see Section 10.5). Several physical phenomena may be explained in terms of the transformation rate– versus–temperature curve of Figure 10.8. First, the size of the product phase particles depends on transformation temperature. For example, for transformations that occur Dependence of 
particle growth rate on the activation energy for diffusion and temperature

at temperatures near Tm, corresponding to low nucleation and high growth rates, few 
nuclei form that grow rapidly. Thus, the resulting microstructure will consist of few and 
relatively large particles (e.g., coarse grains). Conversely, for transformations at lower temperatures, nucleation rates are high and growth rates low, which results in many small particles (e.g., fine grains). Also, from Figure 10.8, when a material is cooled very rapidly through the tempera-ture range encompassed by the transformation rate curve to a relatively low temperature where the rate is extremely low, it is possible to produce nonequilibrium phase structures (e.g., see Sections 10.5 and 11.10).
Kinetic Considerations of Solid-State Transformations
The previous discussion of this section centered on the temperature dependences of nu-cleation, growth, and transformation rates. The time dependence of rate (which is often 
termed the kinetics of a transformation) is also an important consideration, especially 
in the heat treatment of materials. Also, because many transformations of interest to 
materials scientists and engineers involve only solid phases, we devote the following discussion to the kinetics of solid-state transformations. With many kinetic investigations, the fraction of reaction that has occurred is mea-sured as a function of time while the temperature is maintained constant. Transformation progress is usually ascertained by either microscopic examination or measurement of some physical property (such as electrical conductivity) whose magnitude is distinctive of the new phase. Data are plotted as the fraction of transformed material versus the logarithm of time; an S-shaped curve similar to that in Figure 10.10 represents the typical kinetic behavior for most solid-state reactions. Nucleation and growth stages are also indicated in the figure.kineticsFigure 10.9  Schematic plots of (a) trans-

 For solid-state transformations displaying the kinetic behavior in Figure 10.10, the 
fraction of transformation y is a function of time t as follows:
 y=1−exp( −ktn)  (10.17)
where k and n are time-independent constants for the particular reaction. This expres-
sion is often referred to as the Avrami equation.
 By convention, the rate of a transformation is taken as the reciprocal of time re-
quired for the transformation to proceed halfway to completion, t0.5, or
 rate =1
t0.5 (10.18)
 Temperature has a profound influence on the kinetics and thus on the rate of a trans-formation. This is demonstrated in Figure 10.11, which shows y -versus-log
 t S-shaped 
curves at several temperatures for the recrystallization of copper. Section 10.5 gives a detailed discussion on the influence of both temperature and time on phase transformations.Avrami equation—

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.2
Rate of Recrystallization Computation
It is known that the kinetics of recrystallization for some alloy obeys the Avrami equation and 
that the value of n is 3.1. If the fraction recrystallized is 0.30 after 20 min, determine the rate of 
recrystallization.
Solution
The rate of a reaction is defined by Equation 10.18 as
rate =1
t0.5
Therefore, for this problem it is necessary to compute the value of t0.5, the time it takes for 
the reaction to progress to 50% completion—or for the fraction of reaction y to equal 0.50. 
Furthermore, we may determine t0.5 using the Avrami equation, Equation 10.17:
y=1−exp( −ktn)
316  •   Chapter 10  /  Phase Transformations
The problem statement provides us with the value of y (0.30) at some time t (20 min), and also 
the value of n (3.1) from which data it is possible to compute the value of the constant k. In 
order to perform this calculation, some algebraic manipulation of Equation 10.17 is necessary. First, we rearrange this expression as follows:
exp( −kt
n)=1−y
Taking natural logarithms of both sides leads to
 −ktn=ln(1 −y) (10.17a)
Now, solving for k,
k=−  ln(1 −y)
tn
Incorporating values cited above for y, n, and t yields the following value for k:
k=−  ln(1 −0.30)
(20 min)3.1=3.30 ×10−5
At this point, we want to compute t0.5—the value of t  for y = 0.5—which means that it is neces-
sary to establish a form of Equation 10.17 in which t  is the dependent variable. This is accom-
plished using a rearranged form of Equation 10.17a as
tn=−  ln(1 −y)
k
From which we solve for t
t=[− ln(1 −y)
k]1∕n
And for t = t0.5, this equation becomes
t0.5=[− ln(1 −0.5)
k ]1∕n
Now, substituting into this expression the value of k determined above, as well as the value of 
n cited in the problem statement (viz., 3.1), we calculate t0.5 as follows:
t0.5=[− ln(1 −0.5)
3.30 ×10−5]1∕3.1
=24.8 min
And, finally, from Equation 10.18, the rate is equal to
rate =1
t0.5=1
24.8 min=4.0×10−2 (min)−1
Phase transformations may be wrought in metal alloy systems by varying temperature, composition, and the external pressure; however, temperature changes by means of heat treatments are most conveniently utilized to induce phase transformations. This corre-sponds to crossing a phase boundary on the composition–temperature phase diagram as an alloy of given composition is heated or cooled.10.4 METASTABLE VERSUS EQUILIBRIUM STATES
10.5 Isothermal Transformation Diagrams   •  317
 During a phase transformation, an alloy proceeds toward an equilibrium state that is 
characterized by the phase diagram in terms of the product phases and their compositions and relative amounts. As Section 10.3 notes, most phase transformations require some finite time to go to completion, and the speed or rate is often important in the relationship between the heat treatment and the development of microstructure. One limitation of phase diagrams is their inability to indicate the time period required for the attainment of equilibrium. The rate of approach to equilibrium for solid systems is so slow that true equilibrium structures are rarely achieved. When phase transformations are induced by temperature changes, equilibrium conditions are maintained only if heating or cooling is carried out at extremely slow and impractical rates. For other-than-equilibrium cooling, transforma-tions are shifted to lower temperatures than indicated by the phase diagram; for heat-ing, the shift is to higher temperatures. These phenomena are termed  supercooling  and  
superheating, respectively. The degree of each depends on the rate of temperature change; the more rapid the cooling or heating, the greater the supercooling or superheating. For example, for normal cooling rates, the iron–carbon eutectoid reaction is typically dis-placed 10 °C to 20 °C (18 °F to 36 °F) below the equilibrium transformation temperature.
3
 For many technologically important alloys, the preferred state or microstructure is a metastable one, intermediate between the initial and equilibrium states; on occasion, a structure far removed from the equilibrium one is desired. It thus becomes imperative to investigate the influence of time on phase transformations. This kinetic information is, in many instances, of greater value than knowledge of the final equilibrium state.supercooling
superheating
3It is important to note that the treatments relating to the kinetics of phase transformations in Section 10.3 are 
 constrained to the condition of constant temperature. By way of contrast, the discussion of this section pertains to 
phase transformations that occur with changing temperature. This same distinction exists between Sections 10.5  (Isothermal Transformation Diagrams) and 10.6 (Continuous-Cooling Transformation Diagrams).Some of the basic kinetic principles of solid-state transformations are now extended 
and applied specifically to iron–carbon alloys in terms of the relationships among heat treatment, the development of microstructure, and mechanical properties. This system has been chosen because it is familiar and because a wide variety of microstructures and mechanical properties is possible for iron–carbon (or steel) alloys.Microstructural and Property Changes

which is fundamental to the development of microstructure in steel alloys. Upon cooling, 
austenite, having an intermediate carbon concentration, transforms into a ferrite phase, which has a much lower carbon content, and also cementite, which has a much higher  carbon concentration. Pearlite is one microstructural product of this transformation (Figure 9.27); the mechanism of pearlite formation was discussed previously (Section 9.19) and demonstrated in Figure 9.28.Eutectoid reaction

 Temperature plays an important role in the rate of the austenite-to-pearlite transfor-
mation. The temperature dependence for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition is indicated in Figure 10.12, which plots S-shaped curves of the percentage transformation versus the logarithm of time at three different temperatures. For each curve, data were collected after rapidly cooling a specimen composed of 100% austenite to the temperature indicated; that temperature was maintained constant throughout the course of the reaction. A more convenient way of representing both the time and temperature depend-ence of this transformation is shown in the bottom portion of Figure 10.13. Here, the vertical and horizontal axes are, respectively, temperature and the logarithm of time. Two solid  curves are plotted; one represents the time required at each temperature Figure 10.12  For an iron–carbon alloy of

for the initiation or start of the transformation, and the other is for the transformation 
conclusion. The dashed curve corresponds to 50% of transformation completion. These curves were generated from a series of plots of the percentage transformation versus the logarithm of time taken over a range of temperatures. The S-shape curve [for 675 °C 
(1247 °F)] in the upper portion of Figure 10.13 illustrates how the data transfer is made.
 In interpreting this diagram, note first that the eutectoid temperature [727 °C (1341 °F)] 
is indicated by a horizontal line; at temperatures above the eutectoid and for all times, only austenite exists, as indicated in the figure. The austenite-to-pearlite transformation occurs only if an alloy is supercooled to below the eutectoid; as indicated by the curves, the time necessary for the transformation to begin and then end depends on temperature. The start and finish curves are nearly parallel, and they approach the eutectoid line asymptotically. To the left of the transformation start curve, only austenite (which is unstable) is present, whereas to the right of the finish curve, only pearlite exists. In between, the austenite is in the process of transforming to pearlite, and thus both microconstituents are present. According to Equation 10.18, the transformation rate at some particular tempera-ture is inversely proportional to the time required for the reaction to proceed to 50% completion (to the dashed line in Figure 10.13). That is, the shorter this time, the higher the rate. Thus, from Figure 10.13, at temperatures just below the eutectoid (correspond-ing to just a slight degree of undercooling), very long times (on the order of 10
5 s) are 
required for the 50% transformation, and therefore the reaction rate is very slow. The transformation rate increases with decreasing temperature such that at 540 °C (1000 °F), 
only about 3 s is required for the reaction to go to 50% completion. Several constraints are imposed on the use of diagrams like Figure 10.13. First, this particular plot is valid only for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition; for other compositions, the curves have different configurations. In addition, these plots are ac-curate only for transformations in which the temperature of the alloy is held constant throughout the duration of the reaction. Conditions of constant temperature are termed isothermal; thus, plots such as Figure 10.13 are referred to as isothermal transformation 
diagrams or sometimes as time-temperature-transformation (or T-T-T) plots.
 An actual isothermal heat treatment curve (ABCD) is superimposed on the iso-
thermal transformation diagram for a eutectoid iron–carbon alloy in Figure 10.14. Very rapid cooling of austenite to a given temperature is indicated by the near-vertical line AB, and the isothermal treatment at this temperature is represented by the horizontal segment BCD. Time increases from left to right along this line. The transformation of 
austenite to pearlite begins at the intersection, point C (after approximately 3.5 s), and 
has reached completion by about 15 s, corresponding to point D. Figure 10.14 also shows 
schematic microstructures at various times during the progression of the reaction. The thickness ratio of the ferrite and cementite layers in pearlite is approximately 8 to 1. However, the absolute layer thickness depends on the temperature at which the isothermal transformation is allowed to occur. At temperatures just below the eutectoid, relatively thick layers of both the 𝛼-ferrite and Fe
3C phases are produced; this microstruc-
ture is called coarse pearlite, and the region at which it forms is indicated to the right of 
the completion curve on Figure 10.14. At these temperatures, diffusion rates are relatively high, such that during the transformation illustrated in Figure 9.28 carbon atoms can dif-fuse relatively long distances, which results in the formation of thick lamellae. With de-creasing temperature, the carbon diffusion rate decreases, and the layers become progres-sively thinner. The thin-layered structure produced in the vicinity of 540 °C is termed fine 
pearlite; this is also indicated in Figure 10.14.  (“Medium pearlite” exists for layer thick-
nesses intermediate between those of coarse and fine pearlites.) To be discussed in Section 
10.7 is the dependence of mechanical properties on lamellar thickness. Photomicrographs of coarse and fine pearlite for a eutectoid composition are shown in Figure 10.15. For iron–carbon alloys of other compositions, a proeutectoid phase (either fer-rite or cementite) coexists with pearlite, as discussed in Section 9.19. Thus, additional isothermal

curves  corresponding to a proeutectoid transformation also must be included on the 
isothermal transformation diagram. A portion of one such diagram for a 1.13 wt% C alloy is shown in Figure 10.16.
Bainite
In addition to pearlite, other microconstituents that are products of the austenitic trans-formation exist; one of these is called bainite. The microstructure of bainite consists of 
ferrite and cementite phases, and thus diffusional processes are involved in its formation. Bainite forms as needles or plates, depending on the temperature of the transformation; the microstructural details of bainite are so fine that their resolution is possible only using electron microscopy. Figure 10.17 is an electron micrograph that shows a grain of bainite (positioned diagonally from lower left to upper right). It is composed of a ferrite matrix and elongated particles of Fe
3C; the various phases in this micrograph have been labeled. bainiteFigure 10.16  Isothermal transformation

In addition, the phase that surrounds the needle is martensite, the topic addressed by a 
subsequent section. Furthermore, no proeutectoid phase forms with bainite. The time–temperature dependence of the bainite transformation may also be rep-resented on the isothermal transformation diagram. It occurs at temperatures below those at which pearlite forms; begin-, end-, and half-reaction curves are just extensions of those for the pearlitic transformation, as shown in Figure 10.18, the isothermal trans-formation diagram for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition that has been  extended to lower temperatures. All three curves are C-shaped and have a “nose” at point N, where the rate of transformation is a maximum. As may be noted, whereas 
pearlite forms above the nose [i.e., over the temperature range of about 540 °C to 727 °C 
(1000 °F to 1341 °F)], at temperatures between about 215 °C and 540 °C (420 °F and 
1000 °F), bainite is the transformation product.
 Note that the pearlitic and bainitic transformations are competitive with each other, and once some portion of an alloy has transformed into either pearlite or bainite, transfor-mation to the other microconstituent is not possible without reheating to form austenite.
Spheroidite
If a steel alloy having either pearlitic or bainitic microstructures is heated to, and left at, a temperature below the eutectoid for a sufficiently long period of time—for exam-ple, at about 700 °C (1300 °F) for between 18 and 24 h—yet another microstructure will 
form called spheroidite (Figure 10.19). Instead of the alternating ferrite and cementite 
lamellae (pearlite) or the microstructure observed for bainite, the Fe
3C phase appears 
as spherelike particles embedded in a continuous 𝛼–phase matrix. This transformation 
occurs by additional carbon diffusion with no change in the compositions or relative amounts of ferrite and cementite phases. The photomicrograph in Figure 10.20 shows a pearlitic steel that has partially transformed into spheroidite. The driving force for this transformation is the reduction in 𝛼–Fe
3C phase boundary area. The kinetics of sphe-
roidite formation is not included on isothermal transformation diagrams.spheroiditeFigure 10.18  Isothermal transformation

Martensite
Yet another microconstituent or phase called martensite is formed when austenitized 
iron–carbon alloys are rapidly cooled (or quenched) to a relatively low temperature 
(in the vicinity of the ambient). Martensite is a nonequilibrium single-phase structure that results from a diffusionless transformation of austenite. It may be thought of as a transformation product that is competitive with pearlite and bainite. The martensitic transformation occurs when the quenching rate is rapid enough to prevent carbon diffu-sion. Any diffusion whatsoever results in the formation of ferrite and cementite phases. The martensitic transformation is not well understood. However, large numbers of atoms experience cooperative movements, in that there is only a slight displacement of each atom relative to its neighbors. This occurs in such a way that the FCC austenite experiences a polymorphic transformation to a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) martensite. A unit cell of this crystal structure (Figure 10.21) is simply a body-centered cube that has been elon-gated along one of its dimensions; this structure is distinctly different from that for BCC ferrite. All the carbon atoms remain as interstitial impurities in martensite; as such, they constitute a supersaturated solid solution that is capable of rapidly transforming to other structures if heated to temperatures at which diffusion rates become appreciable. Many steels, however, retain their martensitic structure almost indefinitely at room temperature. The martensitic transformation is not, however, unique to iron–carbon alloys. It is found in other systems and is characterized, in part, by the diffusionless transformation.martensiteFigure 10.19  Photomicrograph of a steel

324  •   Chapter 10  /  Phase Transformations
 Because the martensitic transformation does not involve diffusion, it occurs almost 
instantaneously; the martensite grains nucleate and grow at a very rapid rate—the veloc-ity of sound within the austenite matrix. Thus the martensitic transformation rate, for all practical purposes, is time independent. Martensite grains take on a platelike or needlelike appearance, as indicated in Figure 10.22. The white phase in the micrograph is austenite (retained austenite) that did not transform during the rapid quench. As already mentioned, martensite as well as other microconstituents (e.g., pearlite) can coexist. Being a nonequilibrium phase, martensite does not appear on the iron–iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 9.24). The austenite-to-martensite transformation, however, is represented on the isothermal transformation diagram. Because the martensitic trans-formation is diffusionless and instantaneous, it is not depicted in this diagram as the pearlitic and bainitic reactions are. The beginning of this transformation is represented by a horizontal line designated M(start) (Figure 10.23). Two other horizontal and dashed lines, labeled M(50%) and M(90%), indicate percentages of the austenite-to-martensite transformation. The temperatures at which these lines are located vary with alloy composition, but they must be relatively low because carbon diffusion must be virtually nonexistent.
4 The horizontal and linear character of these lines indicates that 
the martensitic transformation is independent of time; it is a function only of the tem-perature to which the alloy is quenched or rapidly cooled. A transformation of this type is termed an athermal transformation.

 Consider an alloy of eutectoid composition that is very rapidly cooled from a tem-
perature above 727 °C (1341 °F) to, say, 165 °C (330 °F). From the isothermal transforma-
tion diagram (Figure 10.23) it may be noted that 50% of the austenite will immediately transform into martensite; as long as this temperature is maintained, there will be no further transformation. The presence of alloying elements other than carbon (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mo, and W) may cause significant changes in the positions and shapes of the curves in the isothermal transformation diagrams. These include (1) shifting to longer times the nose of the austenite-to-pearlite transformation (and also a proeutectoid phase nose, if such exists), and (2) the formation of a separate bainite nose. These alterations may be observed by comparing Figures 10.23 and 10.24, which are isothermal transformation diagrams for carbon and alloy steels, respectively. Steels in which carbon is the prime alloying element are termed plain carbon steels, 
whereas alloy steels contain appreciable concentrations of other elements, including 
those cited in the preceding paragraph. Section 11.2 discusses further the classification and properties of ferrous alloys.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.3
Microstructural Determinations for Three Isothermal Heat Treatments
Using the isothermal transformation diagram for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composi-
tion (Figure 10.23), specify the nature of the final microstructure (in terms of microconstituents present and approximate percentages) of a small specimen that has been subjected to the fol-lowing time–temperature treatments. In each case, assume that the specimen begins at 760 °C 
(1400 °F) and that it has been held at this temperature long enough to have achieved a complete 
and homogeneous austenitic structure.
(a) Rapidly cool to 350 °C (660 °F), hold for 10
4 s, and quench to room temperature.
(b) Rapidly cool to 250 °C (480 °F), hold for 100 s, and quench to room temperature.
(c) Rapidly cool to 650 °C (1200 °F), hold for 20 s, rapidly cool to 400 °C (750 °F), hold for 103 s, 
and quench to room temperature.
Solution
The time–temperature paths for all three treatments are shown in Figure 10.25. In each case, 
the initial cooling is rapid enough to prevent any transformation from occurring.
(a) At 350 °C austenite isothermally transforms into bainite; this reaction begins after about 
10 s and reaches completion at about 500 s elapsed time. Therefore, by 104 s, as stipu-
lated in this problem, 100% of the specimen is bainite, and no further transformation is Tutorial Video:

 possible, even though the final quenching line passes through the martensite region of 
the diagram.
(b) In this case, it takes about 150 s at 250 °C for the bainite transformation to begin, so that at 
100 s the specimen is still 100% austenite. As the specimen is cooled through the martensite region, beginning at about 215 °C, progressively more of the austenite instantaneously 
transforms into martensite. This transformation is complete by the time room temperature is reached, such that the final microstructure is 100% martensite.
(c) For the isothermal line at 650 °C, pearlite begins to form after about 7 s; by the time 20 s has 
elapsed, only approximately 50% of the specimen has transformed to pearlite. The rapid cool to 400 °C is indicated by the vertical line; during this cooling, very little, if any, re-
maining austenite will transform to either pearlite or bainite, even though the cooling line passes through pearlite and bainite regions of the diagram. At 400 °C, we begin timing at 
essentially zero time (as indicated in Figure 10.25); thus, by the time 10
3 s has elapsed, all of 
the remaining 50% austenite will have completely transformed to bainite. Upon quenching to room temperature, any further transformation is not possible inasmuch as no austenite remains, and so the final microstructure at room temperature consists of 50% pearlite and 50% bainite.Time (s)Temperature (°C)

Isothermal heat treatments are not the most practical to conduct because an alloy must be rapidly cooled to and maintained at an elevated temperature from a higher tempera-ture above the eutectoid. Most heat treatments for steels involve the continuous cooling of a specimen to room temperature. An isothermal transformation diagram is valid only for conditions of constant temperature; this diagram must be modified for transforma-tions that occur as the temperature is constantly changing. For continuous cooling, the time required for a reaction to begin and end is delayed. Thus the isothermal curves are shifted to longer times and lower temperatures, as indicated in Figure 10.26 for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition. A plot containing such modified beginning and ending reaction curves is termed a continuous-cooling transformation ( CCT)  diagram. 
Some control may be maintained over the rate of temperature change, depending on the cooling environment. Two cooling curves corresponding to moderately fast and

slow rates are superimposed and labeled in Figure 10.27, again for a eutectoid steel. The 
transformation starts after a time period corresponding to the intersection of the cooling curve with the beginning reaction curve and concludes upon crossing the completion transformation curve. The microstructural products for the moderately rapid and slow cooling rate curves in Figure 10.27 are fine and coarse pearlite, respectively. Normally, bainite will not form when an alloy of eutectoid composition or, for that matter, any plain carbon steel is continuously cooled to room temperature. This is because all of the austenite has transformed into pearlite by the time the bainite trans-formation has become possible. Thus, the region representing the austenite–pearlite  transformation terminates just below the nose (Figure 10.27), as indicated by the curve AB. For any cooling curve passing through AB in Figure 10.27, the transformation ceases at the point of intersection; with continued cooling, the unreacted austenite  begins transforming into martensite upon crossing the M(start) line. With regard to the representation of the martensitic transformation, the M(start), M(50%), and M(90%) lines occur at identical temperatures for both isothermal and continuous-cooling transformation diagrams. This may be verified for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition by comparison of Figures 10.23 and 10.26. For the continuous cooling of a steel alloy, there exists a critical quenching rate, which represents the minimum rate of quenching that produces a totally martensitic structure. This critical cooling rate, when included on the continuous transformation di-agram, just misses the nose at which the pearlite transformation begins, as illustrated in Figure 10.27  Moderately rapid 
and slow cooling curves superimposed 
on a continuous-cooling transformation diagram for a eutectoid iron–carbon alloy.

Figure 10.28. As the figure also shows, only martensite exists for quenching rates 
greater than the critical one; in addition, there is a range of rates over which both pearlite and martensite are produced. Finally, a totally pearlitic structure develops for low cooling rates. Carbon and other alloying elements also shift the pearlite (as well as the proeutec-toid phase) and bainite noses to longer times, thus decreasing the critical cooling rate. In fact, one of the reasons for alloying steels is to facilitate the formation of martensite so that totally martensitic structures can develop in relatively thick cross sections. Figure 10.29 shows the continuous-cooling transformation diagram for the same alloy steel for which the isothermal transformation diagram is presented in Figure 10.24. The presence of the bainite nose accounts for the possibility of formation of bainite for a continuous-cooling heat treatment. Several cooling curves superimposed on Figure 10.29 indicate the critical cooling rate, and also how the transformation behavior and final microstruc-ture are influenced by the rate of cooling. Of interest, the critical cooling rate is decreased even by the presence of carbon. In fact, iron–carbon alloys containing less than about 0.25 wt% carbon are not normally heat-treated to form martensite because quenching rates too rapid to be practical are required. Other alloying elements that are particularly effective in rendering steels heat-treatable are chromium, nickel, molybdenum, manganese, silicon, and tungsten; however, these  elements must be in solid solution with the austenite at the time of quenching.
 In summary, isothermal and continuous-cooling transformation diagrams are, in a 
sense, phase diagrams in which the parameter of time is introduced. Each is experimen-tally determined for an alloy of specified composition, the variables being temperature and time. These diagrams allow prediction of the microstructure after some time period for constant-temperature and continuous-cooling heat treatments, respectively.Figure 10.28  Continuous-cooling

We now discuss the mechanical behavior of iron–carbon alloys having the microstruc-
tures discussed heretofore—namely, fine and coarse pearlite, spheroidite, bainite, and martensite. For all but martensite, two phases are present (ferrite and cementite), and so an opportunity is provided to explore several mechanical property–microstructure relationships that exist for these alloys.
Pearlite
Cementite is much harder but more brittle than ferrite. Thus, increasing the fraction of Fe
3C in a steel alloy while holding other microstructural elements constant will result 
in a harder and stronger material. This is demonstrated in Figure 10.30a, in which the tensile and yield strengths and the Brinell hardness number are plotted as a function of the weight percent carbon (or equivalently as the percentage of Fe
3C) for steels that 
are composed of fine pearlite. All three parameters increase with increasing carbon concentration. Inasmuch as cementite is more brittle, increasing its content results in a decrease in both ductility and toughness (or impact energy). These effects are shown in Figure 10.30b for the same fine pearlitic steels. The layer thickness of each of the ferrite and cementite phases in the microstruc-ture also influences the mechanical behavior of the material. Fine pearlite is harder and 10.7 MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF IRON–CARBON ALLOYSFigure 10.29  Continuous-cooling

stronger than coarse pearlite, as demonstrated by the upper two curves of Figure 10.31 a, 
which plots hardness versus the carbon concentration.
 The reasons for this behavior relate to phenomena that occur at the 𝛼–Fe3C phase 
boundaries. First, there is a large degree of adherence between the two phases across a boundary. Therefore, the strong and rigid cementite phase severely restricts deformation of the softer ferrite phase in the regions adjacent to the boundary; thus the cementite may be said to reinforce the ferrite. The degree of this reinforcement is substantially higher in fine pearlite because of the greater phase boundary area per unit volume of material. In addition, phase boundaries serve as barriers to dislocation motion in much the same way as grain boundaries (Section 7.8). For fine pearlite there are more boundaries through which a dislocation must pass during plastic deformation. Thus, the greater reinforcement and re-striction of dislocation motion in fine pearlite account for its greater hardness and strength. Coarse pearlite is more ductile than fine pearlite, as illustrated in Figure 10.31b , which 
plots percentage reduction in area versus carbon concentration for both microstructure types. This behavior results from the greater restriction to plastic deformation of the fine pearlite.
Spheroidite
Other elements of the microstructure relate to the shape and distribution of the phases. In this respect, the cementite phase has distinctly different shapes and arrangements in the pearlite and spheroidite microstructures (Figures 10.15 and 10.19). Alloys  containing pear-litic microstructures have greater strength and hardness than do those with  spheroidite. Composition (wt% C)Percent Fe3CBrinell hardness number

This is demonstrated in Figure 10.31a , which compares the hardness as a function of the 
weight percent carbon for spheroidite with both the pearlite structure types. This behavior 
is again explained in terms of reinforcement at, and impedance to, dislocation motion across the ferrite–cementite boundaries as discussed previously. There is less boundary area per unit volume in spheroidite, and consequently plastic deformation is not nearly as constrained, which gives rise to a relatively soft and weak material. In fact, of all steel al-loys, those that are softest and weakest have a spheroidite microstructure. As might be expected, spheroidized steels are extremely ductile, much more than either fine or coarse pearlite (Figure 10.31 b). In addition, they are notably tough because 
any crack can encounter only a very small fraction of the brittle cementite particles as it propagates through the ductile ferrite matrix.
Bainite
Because bainitic steels have a finer structure (i.e., smaller 𝛼-ferrite and Fe3C particles), 
they are generally stronger and harder than pearlitic steels; yet they exhibit a desirable combination of strength and ductility. Figures 10.32 a and 10.32b show, respectively, the 
influence of transformation temperature on the strength/hardness and ductility for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition. Temperature ranges over which pearlite and bainite form (consistent with the isothermal transformation diagram for this alloy, Figure 10.18) are noted at the tops of Figures 10.32 a and 10.32b.
Martensite
Of the various microstructures that may be produced for a given steel alloy, martensite is the hardest and strongest and, in addition, the most brittle; it has, in fact, negligible ductility. Its hardness is dependent on the carbon content, up to about 0.6 wt% as demonstrated in Figure 10.33, which plots the hardness of martensite and fine pearlite as a function of weight percent carbon. In contrast to pearlitic steels, the strength and hardness of martensite are not thought to be related to microstructure. Rather, these properties are attributed to the effectiveness of the interstitial carbon atoms in hindering dislocation motion (as a solid-solution effect, Section 7.9), and to the relatively few slip systems (along which dislocations move) for the BCT structure.

 Austenite is slightly denser than martensite, and therefore, during the phase trans-

In the as-quenched state, martensite, in addition to being very hard, is so brittle that 
it cannot be used for most applications; also, any internal stresses that may have been introduced during quenching have a weakening effect. The ductility and toughness of martensite may be enhanced and these internal stresses relieved by a heat treatment known as tempering. Tempering is accomplished by heating a martensitic steel to a temperature below the eutectoid for a specified time period. Normally, tempering is carried out at temperatures 10.8 TEMPERED MARTENSITE
336  •   Chapter 10  /  Phase Transformations
between 250 °C and 650 °C (480 °F and 1200 °F); internal stresses, however, may be re-
lieved at temperatures as low as 200 °C (390 °F). This tempering heat treatment allows, by 
diffusional processes, the formation of tempered martensite,  according to the reaction
 martensite (BCT, single phase) → tempered martensite ( 𝛼+Fe3C phases)  (10.20)
where the single-phase BCT martensite, which is supersaturated with carbon, trans-
forms into the tempered martensite, composed of the stable ferrite and cementite phases, as indicated on the iron–iron carbide phase diagram. The microstructure of tempered martensite consists of extremely small and uni-formly dispersed cementite particles embedded within a continuous ferrite matrix. This is similar to the microstructure of spheroidite except that the cementite particles are much, much smaller. An electron micrograph showing the microstructure of tempered martensite at a very high magnification is presented in Figure 10.34. Tempered martensite may be nearly as hard and strong as martensite but with sub-stantially enhanced ductility and toughness. For example, the hardness-versus-weight percent carbon plot of Figure 10.33 includes a curve for tempered martensite. The hard-ness and strength may be explained by the large ferrite–cementite phase boundary area per unit volume that exists for the very fine and numerous cementite particles. Again, the hard cementite phase reinforces the ferrite matrix along the boundaries, and these boundaries also act as barriers to dislocation motion during plastic deformation. The continuous ferrite phase is also very ductile and relatively tough, which accounts for the improvement of these two properties for tempered martensite. The size of the cementite particles influences the mechanical behavior of tempered martensite; increasing the particle size decreases the ferrite–cementite phase boundary area and, consequently, results in a softer and weaker material yet one that is tougher and more ductile. Furthermore, the tempering heat treatment determines the size of the cementite particles. Heat treatment variables are temperature and time, and most treat-ments are constant-temperature processes. Because carbon diffusion is involved in the martensite-tempered martensite transformation, increasing the temperature accelerates diffusion, the rate of cementite particle growth, and, subsequently, the rate of softening. The dependence of tensile and yield strength and ductility on tempering temperature for an alloy steel is shown in Figure 10.35. Before tempering, the material was quenched in oil to produce the martensitic structure; the tempering time at each temperature was 1 h. This type of tempering data is ordinarily provided by the steel manufacturer. The time dependence of hardness at several different temperatures is presented in Figure 10.36 for a water-quenched steel of eutectoid composition; the time scale is tempered martensite

 logarithmic. With increasing time the hardness decreases, which corresponds to the 
growth and coalescence of the cementite particles. At temperatures approaching the eutectoid [700 °C (1300 °F)] and after several hours, the microstructure will become 
spheroiditic (Figure 10.19), with large cementite spheroids embedded within the continu-ous ferrite phase. Correspondingly, overtempered martensite is relatively soft and ductile.Figure 10.35  Tensile and yield strengths

The tempering of some steels may result in a reduction of toughness as measured by impact 
tests (Section 8.6); this is termed temper embrittlement. The phenomenon occurs when the steel is tempered at a temperature above about 575 °C (1070 °F) followed by slow cooling 
to room temperature, or when tempering is carried out at between approximately 375 °C 
and 575 °C (700 °F and 1070 °F). Steel alloys that are susceptible to temper embrittlement 
have been found to contain appreciable concentrations of the alloying elements manganese, nickel, or chromium and, in addition, one or more of antimony, phosphorus, arsenic, and tin as impurities in relatively low concentrations. The presence of these alloying elements and impurities shifts the ductile-to-brittle transition to significantly higher temperatures; the am-bient temperature thus lies below this transition in the brittle regime. It has been observed that crack propagation of these embrittled materials is intergranular (Figure 8.7)—that is, the fracture path is along the grain boundaries of the precursor austenite phase. Furthermore, alloy and impurity elements have been found to preferentially segregate in these regions. Temper embrittlement may be avoided by (1) compositional control and/or (2) tempering above 575 °C or below 375 °C, followed by quenching to room temperature. 
Furthermore, the toughness of steels that have been embrittled may be improved signifi-cantly by heating to about 600 °C (1100 °F) and then rapidly cooling to below 300 °C (570 °F).Concept Check 10.7 A steel alloy is quenched from a temperature within the austenite

 transformation paths that produce these various microstructures. Here, it is assumed 
that pearlite, bainite, and martensite result from continuous-cooling treatments;  furthermore, the formation of bainite is possible only for alloy steels (not plain carbon ones), as outlined earlier.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.4
Determination of Properties for a Eutectoid Fe–Fe3C Alloy 
Subjected to an Isothermal Heat Treatment
Determine the tensile strength and ductility (%RA) of a eutectoid Fe–Fe3C alloy that has been 
subjected to heat treatment (c) in Example Problem 10.3.
Solution
According to Figure 10.25, the final microstructure for heat treatment (c) consists of approxi-
mately 50% pearlite that formed during the 650 °C isothermal heat treatment, whereas the 
remaining 50% austenite transformed to bainite at 400 °C; thus, the final microstructure is 50% 
pearlite and 50% bainite. The tensile strength may be determined using Figure 10.32 a. For 
pearlite, which was formed at an isothermal transformation temperature of 650 °C, the tensile 
strength is approximately 950 MPa, whereas using this same plot, the bainite that formed at 400°C has an approximate tensile strength of 1300 MPa. Determination of these two tensile 
strength values is demonstrated in the following illustration.Tutorial Video:

 The tensile strength of this two-microconstituent alloy may be approximated using a 
“rule-of-mixtures” relationship—that is, the alloy tensile strength is equal to the fraction-weighted average of the two microconstituents, which may be expressed by the following equation:
 TS
=Wp(TS)p+Wb(TS)b (10.21)
Here,
TS=tensile strength of the alloy,
Wp and Wb = mass fractions of pearlite and bainite, respectively, and
(TS)p and (TS)b = tensile strengths of the respective microconstituents.
Thus, incorporating values for these four parameters into Equation 10.21 leads to the following alloy tensile strength:
 TS
=(0.50)(950 MPa) +(0.50)(1300 MPa)
 =1125 MPa
 This same technique is used for the computation of ductility. In this case, approximate duc-
tility values for the two microconstituents, taken at 650 °C (for pearlite) and 400 °C (for bainite), 
are, respectively, 32%RA and 52%RA, as taken from the following adaptation of Figure 10.32b :

Shape-Memory AlloysMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 10.1
A relatively new group of metals that exhibit an 
interesting (and practical) phenomenon are 
the shape-memory alloys (or SMAs). One of these 
materials, after being deformed, has the ability to return to its predeformed size and shape upon being subjected to an appropriate heat treatment—that is, the material “remembers” its previous size/shape. Deformation normally is carried out at a relatively low temperature, whereas shape memory occurs upon heating.
5 Materials that have been found to be 
capable of recovering significant amounts of deforma-tion (i.e., strain) are nickel–titanium alloys (Nitinol,
6 
is their trade name) and some copper-base alloys (Cu–Zn–Al and Cu–Al–Ni alloys). A shape-memory alloy is polymorphic (Section 3.6)—that is, it may have two crystal structures (or phases), and the shape-memory effect involves phase transformations between them. One phase (termed an austenite phase) has a body-centered cubic structure that exists at elevated temperatures; its structure is represented schematically by the inset shown at stage 1 of Figure 10.38. Upon cooling, the austenite transforms spontaneously into a martensite phase, which is similar to the martensitic transformation for the iron–carbon system (Section 10.5)—that is, it is diffusionless, in-volves an orderly shift of large groups of atoms, and occurs very rapidly, and the degree of transformation is dependent on temperature; temperatures at which the transformation begins and ends are indicated by M
s and Mf labels, respectively, on the left vertical axis 
of Figure 10.38. In addition, this martensite is heavily twinned,
7 as represented schematically by the stage 2 
5Alloys that demonstrate this phenomenon only upon heating are said to have a one-way shape memory. Some of 
these materials experience size/shape changes on both heating and cooling; these are termed two-way shape memory 
alloys. In this discussion, we discuss the mechanism for only the one-way shape memory alloys.
6Nitinol is an acronym for nickel-titanium Naval Ordnance Laboratory, where this alloy was discovered.
7The phenomenon of twinning is described in Section 7 .7 . Adaptation of the rule-of-mixtures expression (Equation 10.21) for this case is as follows:
%RA =Wp(%RA)p+Wb(%RA)b
When values for the Ws and %RAs are inserted into this expression, the approximate ductility 
is calculated as
 %RA =(0.50)(32%RA) +(0.50)(52%RA)
 =42%RA
 In summary, for the eutectoid alloy subjected to the specified isothermal heat treatment, tensile strength and ductility values are approximately 1125 MPa and 42%RA, respectively.
Time-lapse photograph that demonstrates the shape-
memory effect. A wire of a shape-memory alloy  (Nitinol) has been bent and treated such that its memory shape spells the word Nitinol. The wire is then 
deformed and, upon heating (by passage of an electric current), springs back to its predeformed shape; this shape recovery process is recorded on the photograph.

inset of Figure 10.38. Under the influence of an applied 
stress, deformation of martensite (i.e., the passage from stage 2 to stage 3 in Figure 10.38) occurs by the migra-tion of twin boundaries—some twinned regions grow while others shrink; this deformed martensitic structure is represented by the stage 3 inset. Furthermore, when the stress is removed, the deformed shape is retained at this temperature. Finally, upon subsequent heating to the initial temperature, the material reverts back to (i.e., “remembers”) its original size and shape (stage 4). This stage 3–stage 4 process is accompanied by a phase transformation from the deformed martensite into the original high-temperature austenite phase. For these shape-memory alloys, the martensite-to-austenite transformation occurs over a temperature range, be-tween the temperatures denoted by A
s (austenite start) 
and Af (austenite finish) labels on the right vertical axis 
of Figure 10.38. This deformation–transformation cycle may be repeated for the shape-memory material. The original shape (the one that is to be  remembered) is created by heating to well above the A
f temperature (such that the transformation to aus-
tenite is complete) and then restraining the material to the desired memory shape for a sufficient time pe-riod. For example, for Nitinol alloys, a 1-h treatment at 500 °C is necessary.
 Although the deformation experienced by shape-memory alloys is semipermanent, it is not truly

“plastic” deformation, as discussed in Section 6.6, 
nor is it strictly “elastic” (Section 6.3). Rather, it is 
termed thermoelastic, because deformation is nonper-
manent when the deformed material is subsequently heat-treated. The stress-strain-temperature behavior of a thermoelastic material is presented in Figure 10.39. Maximum recoverable deformation strains for these materials are on the order of 8%. For this Nitinol family of alloys, transformation temperatures can be made to vary over a wide tempera-ture range (between about –200 °C and 110 °C) by alter-
ing the Ni–Ti ratio and also by adding other elements. One important SMA application is in weldless, shrink-to-fit pipe couplers used for hydraulic lines on aircraft, for joints on undersea pipelines, and for plumbing on ships and submarines. Each coupler (in the form of a cylindrical sleeve) is fabricated so as to have an inside diameter slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the pipes to be joined. It is then stretched (circumferentially) at some temperature well below the ambient temperature. Next the cou-pler is fitted over the pipe junction and then heated to room temperature; heating causes the coupler to shrink back to its original diameter, thus creating a tight seal between the two pipe sections. There is a host of other applications for alloys displaying this effect—for example, eyeglass frames, tooth-straightening braces, collapsible antennas, greenhouse window openers, antiscald control valves on showers, women’s foundation garments, fire sprin-kler valves, and biomedical applications (such as blood-clot filters, self-extending coronary stents, and bone anchors). Shape-memory alloys also fall into the classification of “smart materials” (Section 1.5) because they sense and respond to environmental (i.e., temperature) changes.Figure 10.39  Typical stress–strain–temperature behavior of a shape-memory alloy, demonstrating its thermoelas-
tic behavior. Specimen deformation, corresponding to the curve from A to B, is carried out at a temperature below 
that at which the martensitic transformation is complete (i.e., Mf of Figure 10.38). Release of the applied stress (also 
at Mf) is represented by the curve BC. Subsequent heating to above the completed austenite-transformation tem-
perature (Af, Figure 10.38) causes the deformed piece to resume its original shape (along the curve from point 
C to point D).

SUMMARY
• Nucleation and growth are the two steps involved in the production of a new 
phase.
• Two types of nucleation are possible: homogeneous and heterogeneous.
For homogeneous nucleation, nuclei of the new phase form uniformly throughout 
the parent phase.
For heterogeneous nucleation, nuclei form preferentially at surfaces of structural 
inhomogeneities (e.g., container surfaces, insoluble impurities).
• In nucleation theory, activation free energy ( ΔG*) represents an energy barrier that 
must be overcome in order for nucleation to occur.
• When a cluster of atoms achieves a critical radius (r*), nucleus growth continues 
spontaneously.
• The activation free energy for heterogeneous nucleation is lower than ΔG* for homo-
geneous nucleation.
• For transformations that are induced by temperature alterations, when rate of tem-
perature change is such that equilibrium conditions are not maintained, transforma-
tion temperature is raised (for heating) and lowered (for cooling).  These phenomena are termed superheating and supercooling, respectively.
• A smaller degree of supercooling (or superheating) is required for heterogeneous 
nucleation than for homogenous nucleation—that is, ΔT
het < ΔThom.
• For typical solid transformations, a plot of fraction transformation versus  logarithm 
of time yields an S-shape curve, as depicted schematically in Figure 10.10.
• The time dependence of degree of transformation is represented by the Avrami equa-
tion, Equation 10.17.
• Transformation rate is taken as the reciprocal of time required for a transformation 
to proceed halfway to its completion, Equation 10.18.
• Isothermal transformation (or time-temperature-transformation, TTT) diagrams pre-
sent the dependence of transformation progress on time while temperature is main-tained constant.  Each diagram is generated for a specific alloy and plots temperature versus the logarithm of time; curves are included for the beginning, 50%, and 100% transformation completion.
• Isothermal transformation diagrams may be modified for continuous-cooling heat 
treatments by the shifting of transformation beginning and ending curves to longer times and lower temperatures; the resulting plots are termed continuous-cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams.
• Times at which continuous-cooling transformations start and conclude are deter-
mined by intersections of cooling curves with the respective transformation beginning and ending curves of the CCT diagrams.
• Isothermal and continuous-cooling transformation diagrams make possible the pre-
diction of microstructural products for specified heat treatments. This feature was demonstrated for alloys of iron and carbon.
• Microstructural products for iron–carbon alloys are as follows:
Coarse and fine pearlite—the alternating 𝛼-ferrite and cementite layers are thinner 
for fine than for coarse pearlite. Coarse pearlite forms at higher temperatures (isothermally) and for slower cooling rates (continuous cooling).
Bainite—this has a very fine structure that is composed of a ferrite matrix and 
elongated cementite particles. It forms at lower temperatures/higher cooling rates than fine pearlite.The Kinetics of Phase

Spheroidite—this is composed of spherelike cementite particles that are embed-
ded in a ferrite matrix. Heating fine/coarse pearlite or bainite at about 700 °C 
for several hours produces spheroidite.
Martensite—this has platelike or needlelike grains of an iron–carbon solid solu-
tion that has a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. Martensite is pro-
duced by rapidly quenching austenite to a sufficiently low temperature so as to prevent carbon diffusion and the formation of pearlite and/or bainite.
Tempered martensite—this consists of very small cementite particles within a 
ferrite matrix. Heating martensite at temperatures within the range of about 250°C to 650 °C results in its transformation to tempered martensite.
• The addition of some alloying elements (other than carbon) shifts pearlite and bainite 
noses on a continuous-cooling transformation diagram to longer times, making the transformation to martensite more favorable (and an alloy more heat-treatable).
• Martensitic steels are the hardest and strongest, yet most brittle.
• Tempered martensite is very strong but relatively ductile.• Bainite has a desirable strength-ductility combination but is not as strong as tempered 
martensite.
• Fine pearlite is harder, stronger, and more brittle than coarse pearlite.• Spheroidite is the softest and most ductile of the microstructures discussed.• Embrittlement of some steel alloys results when specific alloying and impurity ele-
ments are present and upon tempering within a definite temperature range.
• These alloys may be deformed and then return to their predeformed sizes/shapes 
upon heating.
• Deformation occurs by the migration of twin boundaries. A martensite-to-austenite 
phase transformation accompanies the reversion back to the original size/shape.Mechanical Behavior

Often a materials problem is really one of selecting the material that has the right 
combination of characteristics for a specific application. Therefore, the people who are involved in the decision making should have some knowledge of the available options. The first portion of this chapter provides an abbreviated overview of some of the commercial alloys and their general properties and limitations. Materials selection decisions may also be influenced by the ease with which metal alloys may be formed or manufactured into useful components. Alloy properties are altered by fabrication processes, and, in addition, further property alterations may be induced by the employment of appropriate heat treatments. Therefore, in the latter sections of this chapter we consider the details of some of these treatments, including annealing procedures, the heat treating of steels, and precipitation hardening.11.1 INTRODUCTIONEngineers are often involved in materials selection 
decisions, which necessitates that they have some familiarity with the general characteristics of a wide variety of  metals and their alloys (as well as other material types). In addition, access to databases containing property  values for a large number of materials may be required. On occasion, fabrication and processing procedures adversely affect some of the properties of metals. For example, in Section 10.8 we note that some steels may become embrittled during tempering heat treatments. Also, some stainless steels are made susceptible to intergranular corrosion (Section 17.7) when they are heated for long time periods within a specific temperature range. In addition, as we discuss in Section 11.6, regions adjacent to weld junctions may experience decreases in strength and toughness as a result of undesirable microstructural alterations. It is important that engineers become familiar with possible consequences attendant to processing and fabricating procedures in order to prevent unanticipated material failures.

11.2 Ferrous Alloys  •   349
Metal alloys, by virtue of composition, are often grouped into two classes—ferrous and 
nonferrous. Ferrous alloys, those in which iron is the principal constituent, include steels and cast irons. These alloys and their characteristics are the first topics of discus-sion of this section. The nonferrous ones—all alloys that are not iron based—are treated next.Types of Metal Alloys
Ferrous alloys —those in which iron is the prime constituent—are produced in larger 
quantities than any other metal type. They are especially important as engineering construction materials. Their widespread use is accounted for by three factors: (1) iron-containing compounds exist in abundant quantities within the Earth’s crust; (2) metallic iron and steel alloys may be produced using relatively economical extraction, refining, alloying, and fabrication techniques; and (3) ferrous alloys are extremely versatile, in that they may be tailored to have a wide range of mechanical and physical properties. The principal disadvantage of many ferrous alloys is their susceptibility to corrosion. This section discusses compositions, microstructures, and properties of a number of dif-ferent classes of steels and cast irons. A taxonomic classification scheme for the various ferrous alloys is presented in Figure 11.1.ferrous alloy11.2 FERROUS ALLOYS

Steels
Steels are iron–carbon alloys that may contain appreciable concentrations of other 
 alloying elements; there are thousands of alloys that have different compositions and/or heat treatments. The mechanical properties are sensitive to the content of carbon, which is normally less than 1.0 wt%. Some of the more common steels are classified  according to carbon concentration into low-, medium-, and high-carbon types. Subclasses also  exist within each group according to the concentration of other alloying elements. Plain 
carbon steels contain only residual concentrations of impurities other than carbon and 
a little manganese. For alloy steels, more alloying elements are intentionally added in 
specific concentrations.
Low-Carbon Steels
 Of the different steels, those produced in the greatest quantities fall within the low-
carbon classification. These generally contain less than about 0.25 wt% C and are unrespon-sive to heat treatments intended to form martensite; strengthening is accomplished by cold work. Microstructures consist of ferrite and pearlite constituents. As a consequence, these alloys are relatively soft and weak but have outstanding ductility and toughness; in addition, they are machinable, weldable, and, of all steels, are the least expensive to produce. Typical applications include automobile body components, structural shapes (e.g., I-beams, channel and angle iron), and sheets that are used in pipelines, buildings, bridges, and tin cans. Tables 11.1a and 11.1b present the compositions and mechanical properties of several plain low-carbon steels. They typically have a yield strength of 275 MPa (40,000 psi), tensile strengths between 415 and 550 MPa (60,000 and 80,000 psi), and a ductility of 25%EL. Another group of low-carbon alloys are the high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steels.  
They contain other alloying elements such as copper, vanadium, nickel, and molybdenum in combined concentrations as high as 10 wt%, and they possess higher strengths than the plain low-carbon steels. Most may be strengthened by heat treatment, giving ten-sile strengths in excess of 480 MPa (70,000 psi); in addition, they are ductile, formable, and  machinable. Several are listed in Tables 11.1a and 11.1b. In normal atmospheres, plain carbon steel

the HSLA steels are more resistant to corrosion than the plain carbon steels, which they 
have replaced in many applications where structural strength is critical (e.g., bridges, tow-ers, support columns in high-rise buildings, pressure vessels).
Medium-Carbon Steels
 The medium-carbon steels have carbon concentrations between about 0.25 and 0.60 wt%. These alloys may be heat-treated by austenitizing, quenching, and then tempering to improve their mechanical properties. They are most often utilized in the tempered condition, having microstructures of tempered martensite. The plain medium-carbon steels have low hardenabilities (Section 11.8) and can be successfully heat-treated only in very thin sections and with very rapid quenching rates. Additions of chromium, nickel, and molybdenum improve the capacity of these alloys to be heat-treated (Section 11.9), giving rise to a variety of strength–ductility combinations. These heat-treated alloys are stronger than the low-carbon steels, but at a sacrifice of ductility and tough-ness. Applications include railway wheels and tracks, gears, crankshafts, and other ma-chine parts and high-strength structural components calling for a combination of high strength, wear resistance, and toughness. The compositions of several of these alloyed medium-carbon steels are presented in Table 11.2a. Some comment is in order regarding the designation schemes that are also included. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) are responsible for the classification and specification of steels as well as other alloys. The AISI/SAE designation for these steels is a four-digit number: The first two digits indicate the alloy content; the last two give the carbon concentration. For plain carbon steels, the first two digits are 1 and 0; alloy steels are designated by other initial two-digit combinations (e.g., 13, 41, 43). The third and fourth digits represent the weight percent carbon multiplied by 100. For example, a 1060 steel is a plain carbon steel containing 0.60 wt% C.AISI/SAE or

Characteristics of Hot-Rolled Material and Typical Applications for Various Plain Low-Carbon and High-Strength, Low-Alloy Steels
352  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
 A unified numbering system (UNS) is used for uniformly indexing both ferrous 
and nonferrous alloys. Each UNS number consists of a single-letter prefix followed by a five-digit number. The letter is indicative of the family of metals to which an alloy belongs. The UNS designation for these alloys begins with a G, followed by the AISI/SAE number; the fifth digit is a zero. Table 11.2b contains the mechanical characteris-tics and typical applications of several of these steels, which have been quenched and tempered.
High-Carbon Steels
 The high-carbon steels, normally having carbon contents between 0.60 and 1.4 wt%, are the hardest, strongest, and yet least ductile of the carbon steels. They are almost always used in a hardened and tempered condition and, as such, are especially wear resis-tant and capable of holding a sharp cutting edge. The tool and die steels are high-carbon alloys, usually containing chromium, vanadium, tungsten, and molybdenum. These alloying elements combine with carbon to form very hard and wear-resistant carbide compounds (e.g., Cr
23C6, V4C3, and WC). Some tool steel compositions and their applications are 
listed in Table 11.3. These steels are used as cutting tools and dies for forming and shaping materials, as well as in knives, razors, hacksaw blades, springs, and high-strength wire.
Stainless Steels
 The stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion (rusting) in a variety of envi-
ronments, especially the ambient atmosphere. Their predominant alloying element is stainless steel   Composition Ranges

also be enhanced by nickel and molybdenum additions. Stainless steels are divided into three classes on the basis of the predominant phase constituent of the microstructure—martensitic, ferritic, or austenitic. Table 11.4 lists several stainless steels by class, along with composition, typical mechanical properties, and applications. A wide range of mechanical properties combined with excellent resis-tance to corrosion make stainless steels very versatile in their applicability.Table 11.2b   Typical Applications and Mechanical Property Ranges for Oil-Quenched and Tempered Plain Carbon

11.2 Ferrous Alloys  •   355
 Martensitic stainless steels are capable of being heat-treated in such a way that 
martensite is the prime microconstituent. Additions of alloying elements in significant concentrations produce dramatic alterations in the iron–iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 9.24). For austenitic stainless steels, the austenite (or 𝛾) phase field is extended 
to room temperature. Ferritic stainless steels are composed of the 𝛼-ferrite (BCC) 
phase. Austenitic and ferritic stainless steels are hardened and strengthened by cold work because they are not heat-treatable. The austenitic stainless steels are the most corrosion resistant because of the high chromium contents and also the nickel additions; they are produced in the largest quantities. Both martensitic and ferritic stainless steels are magnetic; the austenitic stainlesses are not. Some stainless steels are frequently used at elevated temperatures and in severe en-vironments because they resist oxidation and maintain their mechanical integrity under such conditions; the upper temperature limit in oxidizing atmospheres is about 1000 °C 
(1800°F). Equipment employing these steels includes gas turbines, high-temperature steam boilers, heat-treating furnaces, aircraft, missiles, and nuclear power–generating units. Some 316L austentic steels (prepared by melting under vacuum conditions) are used in biomedical applications such as temporary orthopedic devices. These include plates, screws, pins, and wires to stabilize fractured bones and facilitate the healing process. Also included in Table 11.4 is one ultra-high-strength stainless steel (17-4PH), which is unusually strong and corrosion resistant. Strengthening is accomplished by precipitation-hardening heat treatments (Section 11.10).
Cast Irons
Generically, cast irons are a class of ferrous alloys with carbon contents above 2.14 wt%; 
in practice, however, most cast irons contain between 3.0 and 4.5 wt% C and, in addi-tion, other alloying elements. A reexamination of the iron–iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 9.24) reveals that alloys within this composition range become completely liquid at temperatures between approximately 1150 °C and 1300°C (2100°F and 2350°F), which 
is considerably lower than for steels. Thus, they are easily melted and amenable to cast-ing. Furthermore, some cast irons are very brittle, and casting is the most convenient fabrication technique. Cementite (Fe
3C) is a metastable compound, and under some circumstances it can be 
made to dissociate or decompose to form 𝛼-ferrite and graphite, according to the reaction
 Fe3C →3Fe ( 𝛼)+C (graphite)  (11.1)
Thus, the true equilibrium diagram for iron and carbon is not that presented in Figure 
9.24, but rather as shown in Figure 11.2. The two diagrams are virtually identical on the iron-rich side (e.g., eutectic and eutectoid temperatures for the Fe–Fe
3C system are 
1147°C and 727°C, respectively, as compared to 1153 °C and 740°C for Fe–C); however, 
Figure 11.2 extends to 100 wt% C such that graphite is the carbon-rich phase, instead of cementite at 6.7 wt% C (Figure 9.24). This tendency to form graphite is regulated by the composition and rate of cooling. Graphite formation is promoted by the presence of silicon in concentrations greater than cast iron

about 1 wt%. Also, slower cooling rates during solidification favor graphitization (the 
formation of graphite). For most cast irons, the carbon exists as graphite, and both micro-structure and mechanical behavior depend on composition and heat treatment. The most common cast iron types are gray, nodular, white, malleable, and compacted graphite.
Gray Iron
 The carbon and silicon contents of gray cast irons vary between 2.5 and 4.0 wt% and 1.0 and 3.0 wt%, respectively. For most of these cast irons, the graphite exists in the form of flakes (similar to corn flakes), which are normally surrounded by an 𝛼-ferrite or pearl-ite matrix; the microstructure of a typical gray iron is shown in Figure 11.3a . Because of 
these graphite flakes, a fractured surface takes on a gray appearance—hence its name. Mechanically, gray iron is comparatively weak and brittle in tension as a conse-quence of its microstructure; the tips of the graphite flakes are sharp and pointed and may serve as points of stress concentration when an external tensile stress is applied. Strength and ductility are much higher under compressive loads. Typical mechanical properties and compositions of several common gray cast irons are listed in Table 11.5. Gray irons have some desirable characteristics and are used extensively. They are very ef-fective in damping vibrational energy; this is represented in Figure 11.4, which compares the relative damping capacities of steel and gray iron. Base structures for  machines and heavy equipment that are exposed to vibrations are frequently constructed of this material. In addition, gray irons exhibit a high resistance to wear. Furthermore, in the molten state they have a high fluidity at casting temperature, which permits casting pieces that have intricate shapes; also, casting shrinkage is low. Finally, and perhaps most important, gray cast irons are among the least expensive of all metallic materials. Gray irons having microstructures different from that shown in Figure 11.3 a may be 
generated by adjusting composition and/or using an appropriate treatment. For exam-ple, lowering the silicon content or increasing the cooling rate may prevent the complete dissociation of cementite to form graphite (Equation 11.1). Under these circumstances the microstructure consists of graphite flakes embedded in a pearlite matrix. Figure 11.5 compares schematically the several cast iron microstructures obtained by varying the composition and heat treatment.gray cast iron2.1 wt% C

11.2 Ferrous Alloys  •   359
Ductile (or Nodular) Iron
 Adding a small amount of magnesium and/or cerium to the gray iron before casting 
produces a distinctly different microstructure and set of mechanical properties. Graphite still forms, but as nodules or spherelike particles instead of flakes. The resulting alloy is called ductile  or nodular iron,  and a typical microstructure is shown in Figure 11.3 b. The 
matrix phase surrounding these particles is either pearlite or ferrite, depending on heat treatment (Figure 11.5); it is normally pearlite for an as-cast piece. However, a heat treat-ment for several hours at about 700 °C (1300° F) yields a ferrite matrix, as in this photomi-
crograph. Castings are stronger and much more ductile than gray iron, as a comparison of their mechanical properties in Table 11.5 shows. In fact, ductile iron has mechanical characteristics approaching those of steel. For example, ferritic ductile irons have tensile strengths between 380 and 480 MPa (55,000 and 70,000 psi) and ductilities (as percent elongation) from 10% to 20%. Typical applications for this material include valves, pump bodies, crankshafts, gears, and other automotive and machine components.
White Iron and Malleable Iron
 For low-silicon cast irons (containing less than 1.0 wt% Si) and rapid cooling rates, most of the carbon exists as cementite instead of graphite, as indicated in Figure 11.5. A fracture surface of this alloy has a white appearance, and thus it is termed white cast 
iron. An optical photomicrograph showing the microstructure of white iron is presented 
in Figure 11.3c. Thick sections may have only a surface layer of white iron that was 
“chilled” during the casting process; gray iron forms at interior regions, which cool more slowly. As a consequence of large amounts of the cementite phase, white iron is extremely hard but also very brittle, to the point of being virtually unmachinable. Its use is limited to applications that necessitate a very hard and wear-resistant surface, without a high degree of ductility—for example, as rollers in rolling mills. Generally, white iron is used as an intermediary in the production of yet another cast iron, malleable iron.
 Heating white iron at temperatures between 800° C and 900° C (1470° F and 1650° F) 
for a prolonged time period and in a neutral atmosphere (to prevent oxidation) causes a decomposition of the cementite, forming graphite, which exists in the form of clusters or rosettes surrounded by a ferrite or pearlite matrix, depending on cooling rate, as indicated in Figure 11.5. A photomicrograph of a ferritic malleable iron is presented in Figure 11.3d . 
The microstructure is similar to that of nodular iron (Figure 11.3 b), which accounts for 
relatively high strength and appreciable ductility or malleability. Some typical mechanical characteristics are also listed in Table 11.5. Representative applications include connect-ing rods, transmission gears, and differential cases for the automotive industry, and also flanges, pipe fittings, and valve parts for railroad, marine, and other heavy-duty services.
 Gray and ductile cast irons are produced in approximately the same amounts; how-
ever, white and malleable cast irons are produced in smaller quantities.ductile (nodular)

Concept Check 11.2 It is possible to produce cast irons that consist of a martensite matrix 
in which graphite is embedded in either fl  ake, nodule, or rosette form. Briefl  y describe the treat-
ment necessary to produce each of these three microstructures.

Compacted Graphite Iron
 A relatively recent addition to the family of cast irons is compacted graphite iron 
 (abbreviated CGI). As with gray, ductile, and malleable irons, carbon exists as graphite, compacted

whose formation is promoted by the presence of silicon. Silicon content ranges between 
1.7 and 3.0 wt%, whereas carbon concentration is normally between 3.1 and 4.0 wt%. Two CGI materials are included in Table 11.5. Microstructurally, the graphite in CGI alloys has a wormlike (or vermicular) shape; a typical CGI microstructure is shown in the optical micrograph of Figure 11.3e. In a sense, this microstructure is intermediate between that of gray iron (Figure 11.3 a) and (a)

ductile (nodular) iron (Figure 11.3 b), and, in fact, some of the graphite (less than 20%) 
may be as nodules. However, sharp edges (characteristic of graphite flakes) should be 
avoided; the presence of this feature leads to a reduction in fracture and fatigue resis-tance of the material. Magnesium and/or cerium is also added, but concentrations are lower than for ductile iron. The chemistries of CGIs are more complex than for the other cast iron types; compositions of magnesium, cerium, and other additives must be controlled so as to produce a microstructure that consists of the wormlike graphite par-ticles while at the same time limiting the degree of graphite nodularity, and preventing the formation of graphite flakes. Depending on heat treatment, the matrix phase will be pearlite and/or ferrite. As with the other types of cast irons, the mechanical properties of CGIs are related to microstructure: graphite particle shape, as well as the matrix phase/microconstituent. An increase in degree of nodularity of the graphite particles leads to enhancements of both strength and ductility. Furthermore, CGIs with ferritic matrices have lower strengths and higher ductilities than those with pearlitic matrices. Tensile and yield strengths for com-pacted graphite irons are comparable to values for ductile and malleable irons, yet are greater than those observed for the higher-strength gray irons (Table 11.5). In addition, ductilities for CGIs are intermediate between values for gray and ductile irons; moduli of elasticity range between 140 and 165 GPa (20 × 10
6 and 24 × 106 psi).
 Compared to the other cast iron types, desirable characteristics of CGIs include the following:
• Higher thermal conductivity• Better resistance to thermal shock (i.e., fracture resulting from rapid temperature 
changes)
• Lower oxidation at elevated temperatures
 Compacted graphite irons are now being used in a number of important applica-tions, including diesel engine blocks, exhaust manifolds, gearbox housings, brake discs for high-speed trains, and flywheels.
Steel and other ferrous alloys are consumed in exceedingly large quantities because they have such a wide range of mechanical properties, may be fabricated with relative ease, and are economical to produce. However, they have some distinct limitations, chiefly (1) a relatively high density, (2) a comparatively low electrical conductivity, and (3) an inherent susceptibility to corrosion in some common environments. Thus, for many applications it is advantageous or even necessary to use other alloys that have more suitable property combinations. Alloy systems are classified either according to the base metal or according to some specific characteristic that a group of alloys share. This section discusses the following metal and alloy systems: copper, aluminum, magnesium, and titanium alloys; the refractory metals; the superalloys; the noble metals; and miscel-laneous alloys, including those that have nickel, lead, tin, zirconium, and zinc as base metals. Figure 11.6 represents a classification scheme for nonferrous alloys discussed in this section. On occasion, a distinction is made between cast and wrought alloys. Alloys that are so brittle that forming or shaping by appreciable deformation is not possible typi-cally are cast; these are classified as cast alloys. However, those that are amenable to 
mechanical deformation are termed wrought alloys.
 In addition, the heat-treatability of an alloy system is mentioned frequently. “Heat-treatable” designates an alloy whose mechanical strength is improved by precipitation hardening (Section 11.10) or a martensitic transformation (normally the former), both of which involve specific heat-treating procedures.

Copper and Its Alloys
Copper and copper-based alloys possessing a desirable combination of physical proper-
ties have been used in quite a variety of applications since antiquity. Unalloyed cop-per is so soft and ductile that it is difficult to machine; also, it has an almost unlimited capacity to be cold worked. Furthermore, it is highly resistant to corrosion in diverse environments including the ambient atmosphere, seawater, and some industrial chemi-cals. The mechanical and corrosion-resistance properties of copper may be improved by alloying. Most copper alloys cannot be hardened or strengthened by heat-treating procedures; consequently, cold working and/or solid-solution alloying must be used to improve these mechanical properties. The most common copper alloys are the brasses, for which zinc, as a substitutional 
impurity, is the predominant alloying element. As may be observed for the copper–zinc phase diagram (Figure 9.19), the 𝛼 phase is stable for concentrations up to ap-
proximately 35 wt% Zn. This phase has an FCC crystal structure, and 𝛼-brasses are 
relatively soft, ductile, and easily cold worked. Brass alloys having a higher zinc content contain both 𝛼 and 𝛽′ phases at room temperature. The 𝛽′ phase has an ordered BCC 
crystal structure and is harder and stronger than the 𝛼 phase; consequently, 𝛼 + 𝛽′ 
 alloys are generally hot worked. Some of the common brasses are yellow, naval, and cartridge brass; muntz metal; and gilding metal. The compositions, properties, and typical uses of several of these al-loys are listed in Table 11.6. Some of the common uses for brass alloys include costume jewelry, cartridge casings, automotive radiators, musical instruments, electronic packag-ing, and coins. The bronzes are alloys of copper and several other elements, including tin, 
aluminum, silicon, and nickel. These alloys are somewhat stronger than the brasses, yet they still have a high degree of corrosion resistance. Table 11.6 lists several of the bronze alloys and their compositions, properties, and applications. Generally they are used when, in addition to corrosion resistance, good tensile properties are required. The most common heat-treatable copper alloys are the beryllium coppers. They possess a remarkable combination of properties: tensile strengths as high as 1400 MPa (200,000 psi), excellent electrical and corrosion properties, and wear resis-tance when properly lubricated; they may be cast, hot worked, or cold worked. High strengths are attained by precipitation-hardening heat treatments (Section 11.10). These alloys are costly because of the beryllium additions, which range between 1.0 brass

Aluminum and Its Alloys
Aluminum and its alloys are characterized by a relatively low density (2.7 g/cm3 as 
compared to 7.9 g/cm3 for steel), high electrical and thermal conductivities, and a 
resistance to corrosion in some common environments, including the ambient at-
mosphere. Many of these alloys are easily formed by virtue of high ductility; this is evidenced by the thin aluminum foil sheet into which the relatively pure material may be rolled. Because aluminum has an FCC crystal structure, its ductility is retained even at very low temperatures. The chief limitation of aluminum is its low melting temperature [660°C (1220°F)], which restricts the maximum temperature at which it can be used. The mechanical strength of aluminum may be enhanced by cold work and by alloying; however, both processes tend to decrease resistance to corrosion. Principal alloying elements include copper, magnesium, silicon, manganese, and zinc. Non-heat-treatable alloys consist of a single phase, for which an increase in strength is achieved by solid-solution strengthening. Others are rendered heat-treatable (capable of being precipitation hardened) as a result of alloying. In several of these alloys, precipitation hardening is due to the precipitation of two elements other than aluminum to form an intermetallic compound such as MgZn
2.
 Generally, aluminum alloys are classified as either cast or wrought. Composition for both types is designated by a four-digit number that indicates the principal impu-rities and, in some cases, the purity level. For cast alloys, a decimal point is located between the last two digits. After these digits is a hyphen and the basic temper 
designation —a letter and possibly a one- to three-digit number, which indicates the 
mechanical and/or heat treatment to which the alloy has been subjected. For example, F, H, and O represent, respectively, the as-fabricated, strain-hardened, and annealed states. Table 11.7 presents the temper designation scheme for aluminum alloys. Furthermore, compositions, properties, and applications of several wrought and cast alloys are given in Table 11.8. Common applications of aluminum alloys include air-craft structural parts, beverage cans, bus bodies, and automotive parts (engine blocks, pistons, and manifolds). Recent attention has been given to alloys of aluminum and other low-density met-als (e.g., Mg and Ti) as engineering materials for transportation, to effect reductions in fuel consumption. An important characteristic of these materials is specific strength,  
which is quantified by the tensile strength–specific gravity ratio. Even though an alloy of one of these metals may have a tensile strength that is inferior to that of a denser material (such as steel), on a weight basis it will be able to sustain a larger load. A generation of new aluminum–lithium alloys has been developed recently for use by the aircraft and aerospace industries. These materials have relatively low densities (between about 2.5 and 2.6 g/cm
3), high specific moduli (elastic modulus–
specific gravity ratios), and excellent fatigue and low-temperature toughness prop-erties. Furthermore, some of them may be precipitation hardened. However, these materials are more costly to manufacture than the conventional aluminum alloys because special processing techniques are required as a result of lithium’s chemical reactivity.temper designation

Magnesium and Its Alloys
Perhaps the most outstanding characteristic of magnesium is its density, 1.7 g/cm3, which 
is the lowest of all the structural metals; therefore, its alloys are used where light weight 
is an important consideration (e.g., in aircraft components). Magnesium has an HCP crystal structure, is relatively soft, and has a low elastic modulus: 45 GPa (6.5 × 10
6 psi). 
At room temperature, magnesium and its alloys are difficult to deform; in fact, only small degrees of cold work may be imposed without annealing. Consequently, most fab-rication is by casting or hot working at temperatures between 200 °C and 350°C (400°F 
and 650°F). Magnesium, like aluminum, has a moderately low melting temperature [651°C (1204°F)]. Chemically, magnesium alloys are relatively unstable and especially susceptible to corrosion in marine environments. However, corrosion or oxidation re-sistance is reasonably good in the normal atmosphere; it is believed that this behavior is due to impurities rather than being an inherent characteristic of Mg alloys. Fine mag-nesium powder ignites easily when heated in air; consequently, care should be exercised when handling it in this state.

 These alloys are also classified as either cast or wrought, and some of them are 
heat-treatable. Aluminum, zinc, manganese, and some of the rare earths are the ma-jor alloying elements. A composition–temper designation scheme similar to that for aluminum alloys is also used. Table 11.9 lists several common magnesium alloys and their compositions, properties, and applications. These alloys are used in aircraft and missile applications, as well as in luggage. Furthermore, in recent years the demand for magnesium alloys has increased dramatically in a host of different industries. For many applications, magnesium alloys have replaced engineering plastics that have comparable densities because the magnesium materials are stiffer, more recyclable, and less costly to produce. For example, magnesium is employed in a variety of handheld devices (e.g., chainsaws, powertools, hedge clippers), automobiles (e.g., steering wheels and columns, seat frames, transmission cases), and audio, video, computer, and communications equipment (e.g., laptop computers, camcorders, TV sets, cellular telephones).Table 11.9  Compositions, Mechanical Properties, and Typical Applications for Six Common Magnesium Alloys

368  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
Titanium and Its Alloys
Titanium and its alloys are relatively new engineering materials that possess an ex-
traordinary combination of properties. The pure metal has a relatively low density (4.5 g/cm
3), a high melting point [1668°C (3035°F)], and an elastic modulus of 107 
GPa (15.5 × 106 psi). Titanium alloys are extremely strong: Room-temperature tensile 
strengths as high as 1400 MPa (200,000 psi) are attainable, yielding remarkable specific strengths. Furthermore, the alloys are highly ductile and easily forged and machined. Unalloyed (i.e., commercially pure) titanium has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, sometimes denoted as the 𝛼 phase at room temperature. At 883°C (1621°F), 
the HCP material transforms into a body-centered cubic (or 𝛽) phase. This transfor-
mation temperature is strongly influenced by the presence of alloying elements. For example, vanadium, niobium, and molybdenum decrease the 𝛼-to-𝛽 transformation 
temperature and promote the formation of the 𝛽 phase (i.e., are 𝛽-phase stabilizers), 
which may exist at room temperature. In addition, for some compositions, both 𝛼 and 𝛽 
phases coexist. On the basis of which phase(s) is (are) present after processing, titanium alloys fall into four classifications: 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛼 + 𝛽, and near 𝛼.
 The 𝛼-titanium alloys, often alloyed with aluminum and tin, are preferred for high-
temperature applications because of their superior creep characteristics. Strengthening by heat treatment is not possible because 𝛼 is the stable phase; consequently, these 
materials are normally used in annealed or recrystallized states. Strength and toughness are satisfactory, whereas forgeability is inferior to that of the other Ti alloy types. The 𝛽 titanium alloys contain sufficient concentrations of 𝛽-stabilizing elements (V 
and Mo) such that, upon cooling at sufficiently rapid rates, the 𝛽 (metastable) phase is 
retained at room temperature. These materials are highly forgeable and exhibit high fracture toughnesses. The 𝛼 + 𝛽 materials are alloyed with stabilizing elements for both constituent 
phases. The strength of these alloys may be improved and controlled by heat treatment. A variety of microstructures is possible that consist of an 𝛼 phase and a retained or 
transformed 𝛽 phase. In general, these materials are quite formable.
 Near- 𝛼 alloys are also composed of both 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases, with only a small propor-
tion of 𝛽—that is, they contain low concentrations of 𝛽 stabilizers. Their properties and 
fabrication characteristics are similar to those of the 𝛼 materials, except that a greater 
diversity of microstructures and properties are possible for near- 𝛼 alloys.
 The major limitation of titanium is its chemical reactivity with other materials at ele-vated temperatures. This property has necessitated the development of nonconventional 
refining, melting, and casting techniques; consequently, titanium alloys are quite expen-sive. In spite of this reactivity at high temperature, the corrosion resistance of titanium alloys at normal temperatures is unusually high; they are virtually immune to air, marine, and a variety of industrial environments. When implanted into the human body, titanium alloys are highly biocompatible—that is, they are very unreactive when exposed to body fluids and tissues and do not release toxic substances. In addition, these materials have relatively low densities and desirable mechanical characteristics. Consequently, they are used extensively for dental and orthopedic (hip and knee) implants. Table 11.10 presents several titanium alloys along with their typical properties and applications. They are commonly used in airplane structures, space vehicles, and in the petroleum and chemical industries.
The Refractory Metals
Metals that have extremely high melting temperatures are classified as refractory  metals. Included in this group are niobium (Nb), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), and tantalum (Ta). Melting temperatures range between 2468 °C (4474°F) for niobium 
and 3410°C (6170°F), the highest melting temperature of any metal, for tungsten.

Interatomic bonding in these metals is extremely strong, which accounts for the melting 
temperatures, and, in addition, large elastic moduli and high strengths and hardnesses, at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. The applications of these metals are  varied. For example, tantalum and molybdenum are alloyed with stainless steel to improve its corrosion resistance. Molybdenum alloys are used for extrusion dies and structural parts in space vehicles; incandescent light filaments, x-ray tubes, and welding electrodes employ tungsten alloys. Tantalum is immune to chemical attack by virtually all environ-ments at temperatures below 150°C and is frequently used in applications requiring such a corrosion-resistant material.
The Superalloys
The superalloys have superlative combinations of properties. Most are used in aircraft turbine components, which must withstand exposure to severely oxidizing environ-ments and high temperatures for reasonable time periods. Mechanical integrity under these conditions is critical; in this regard, density is an important consideration because centrifugal stresses are diminished in rotating members when the density is reduced. These materials are classified according to the predominant metal(s) in the alloy, of which there are three groups: iron–nickel, nickel, and cobalt. Other alloying elements include the refractory metals (Nb, Mo, W, Ta), chromium, and titanium. Furthermore, these alloys are also categorized as wrought or cast. Compositions of several of them are presented in Table 11.11. In addition to turbine applications, superalloys are used in nuclear reactors and petrochemical equipment.

11.3 Nonferrous Alloys   •  371
The Noble Metals
The noble or precious metals are a group of eight elements that have some physical 
characteristics in common. They are expensive (precious) and are superior or notable (noble) in properties—characteristically soft, ductile, and oxidation resistant. The noble metals are silver, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium; the first three are most common and are used extensively in jewelry. Silver and gold may be strengthened by solid-solution alloying with copper; sterling silver is a silver–copper alloy containing approximately 7.5 wt% Cu. Alloys of both silver and gold are employed as dental restoration materials. Some integrated circuit electrical contacts are of gold. Platinum is used for chemical laboratory equipment, as a catalyst (especially in the manufacture of gasoline), and in thermocouples to measure elevated temperatures.
Miscellaneous Nonferrous Alloys
The preceding discussion covers the vast majority of nonferrous alloys; however, a num-ber of others are found in a variety of engineering applications, and a brief mention of these is worthwhile. Nickel and its alloys are highly resistant to corrosion in many environments, espe-cially those that are basic (alkaline). Nickel is often coated or plated on some metals that are susceptible to corrosion as a protective measure. Monel, a nickel-based alloy containing approximately 65 wt% Ni and 28 wt% Cu (the balance is iron), has very high strength and is extremely corrosion resistant; it is used in pumps, valves, and other com-ponents that are in contact with acid and petroleum solutions. As already mentioned, nickel is one of the principal alloying elements in stainless steels and one of the major constituents in the superalloys. Lead, tin, and their alloys find some use as engineering materials. Both lead and tin are mechanically soft and weak, have low melting temperatures, are quite resistant to many corrosion environments, and have recrystallization temperatures below room temperature. Some common solders are lead–tin alloys, which have low melting tem-peratures. Applications for lead and its alloys include x-ray shields and storage batter-ies. The primary use of tin is as a very thin coating on the inside of plain carbon steel cans (tin cans) that are used for food containers; this coating inhibits chemical reactions between the steel and the food products. Unalloyed zinc also is a relatively soft metal having a low melting temperature and a subambient recrystallization temperature. Chemically, it is reactive in a number of com-mon environments and, therefore, susceptible to corrosion. Galvanized steel is just plain carbon steel that has been coated with a thin zinc layer; the zinc preferentially corrodes and protects the steel (Section 17.9). Typical applications of galvanized steel are familiar (sheet metal, fences, screen, screws, etc.). Common applications of zinc alloys include padlocks, plumbing fixtures, automotive parts (door handles and grilles), and office equipment. Although zirconium is relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust, not until quite recent times were commercial refining techniques developed. Zirconium and its alloys are ductile and have other mechanical characteristics that are comparable to those of titanium alloys and the austenitic stainless steels. However, the primary asset of these alloys is their resistance to corrosion in a host of corrosive media, including superheated water. Furthermore, zirconium is transparent to thermal neutrons, so that its alloys have been used as cladding for uranium fuel in water-cooled nuclear reactors. In terms of cost, these alloys are also often the materials of choice for heat exchangers, reactor vessels, and piping systems for the chemical-processing and nuclear industries. They are also used in incendiary ordnance and in sealing devices for vacuum tubes. Appendix B tabulates a wide variety of properties (density, elastic modulus, yield and tensile strengths, electrical resistivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, etc.) for a large number of metals and alloys.

Metal Alloys Used for Euro CoinsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 11.1
On January 1, 2002, the euro became the single 
legal currency in 12 European countries; since 
that date, several other nations have also joined the European monetary union and have adopted the 
euro as their official currency. Euro coins are minted in eight different denominations: 1 and 2 euros, as well as 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 euro cent. Each coin has a common design on one face; the reverse face design is one of several chosen by the monetary union coun-tries. Several of these coins are shown in Figure 11.7. In deciding which metal alloys to use for these coins, a number of issues were considered, most of them centered on material properties.
• The ability to distinguish a coin of one denomina-
tion from that of another denomination is impor-
tant. This may be accomplished by having coins of different sizes, colors, and shapes. With regard to color, alloys must be chosen that retain their dis-tinctive colors, which means that they do not easily tarnish in the air and other commonly encountered environments.
• Security is an important issue—that is, producing 
coins that are diffi  cult to counterfeit. Most vend-
ing machines use electrical conductivity to identify coins, to prevent false coins from being used. This means that each coin must have its own unique electronic signature, which depends on its alloy composition.• The alloys chosen must be coinable, or easy to 
mint—that is, suffi  ciently soft and ductile to allow design reliefs to be stamped into the coin surfaces.
• The alloys must be wear resistant (i.e., hard and 
strong) for long-term use and so that the reliefs stamped into the coin surfaces are retained. Strain hardening (Section 7 .10) occurs during the stamp-ing operation, which enhances hardness.
• High degrees of corrosion resistance in common 
environments are required for the alloys selected, to ensure minimal material losses over the life-times of the coins.
• It is highly desirable to use alloys of a base metal 
(or metals) that retains (retain) its (their) intrinsic value(s).
• Alloy recyclability is another requirement for the 
alloy(s) used.
• The alloy(s) from which the coins are made 
should relate to human health considerations—that is, have antibacterial characteristics so that undesirable microorganisms will not grow on their surfaces.
 Copper was selected as the base metal for all euro coins, because it and its alloys satisfy these criteria. Several different copper alloys and alloy combinations are used for the eight different coins, as follows:
• 2-euro coin: This coin is termed bimetallic —it con-
sists of an outer ring and an inner disk. For the 
outer ring, a 75Cu–25Ni alloy is used, which has a silver color. The inner disk is composed of a three-layer structure—high-purity nickel that is clad on both sides with a nickel brass alloy (75Cu–20Zn–5Ni); this alloy has a gold color.
• 1 -euro coin: This coin is also bimetallic, but the 
 alloys used for its outer ring and inner disk are  reversed from those for the 2-euro coin.
• 50-, 20-, and 10-euro-cent pieces: These coins 
are  made of a “Nordic gold” alloy—89Cu–5Al–5Zn–1Sn.
• 5-, 2-, and 1 -euro-cent pieces: Copper-plated steels 
are used for these coins.

11.4 Forming Operations  •   373
Metal fabrication techniques are normally preceded by refining, alloying, and often 
heat-treating processes that produce alloys with the desired characteristics. The clas-sifications of fabrication techniques include various metal-forming methods, casting, powder metallurgy, welding, machining, and 3D printing; often two or more must be used before a piece is finished. The methods chosen depend on several factors; the most important are the properties of the metal, the size and shape of the finished piece, and the cost. The metal fabrication techniques we discuss are classified according to the scheme illustrated in Figure 11.8.Fabrication of Metals
Forming operations are those in which the shape of a metal piece is changed by plastic deformation; for example, forging, rolling, extrusion, and drawing are com-mon forming techniques. The deformation must be induced by an external force or stress, the magnitude of which must exceed the yield strength of the material. Most metallic materials are especially amenable to these procedures, being at least moderately ductile and capable of some permanent deformation without cracking or fracturing. When deformation is achieved at a temperature above that at which recrystal-lization occurs, the process is termed hot working (Section 7.12); otherwise, it is cold 
working. With most of the forming techniques, both hot- and cold-working procedures are possible. For hot-working operations, large deformations are possible, which may be successively repeated because the metal remains soft and ductile. Also, deformation energy requirements are less than for cold working. However, most metals experience some  surface oxidation, which results in material loss and a poor final surface finish. 
Cold working produces an increase in strength with the attendant decrease in ductility 
because the metal strain hardens; advantages over hot working include a higher quality surface finish, better mechanical properties and a greater variety of them, and closer dimensional control of the finished piece. On occasion, the total deformation is accom-plished in a series of steps in which the piece is successively cold worked a small amount and then process annealed (Section 11.7); however, this is an expensive and inconven-ient procedure. The forming operations to be discussed are illustrated schematically in Figure 11.9.

Forging
Forging is mechanically working or deforming a single piece of a usually hot metal; this 
may be accomplished by the application of successive blows or by continuous squeezing. Forgings are classified as either closed or open die. For closed die, a force is brought to bear on two or more die halves having the finished shape such that the metal is de-formed in the cavity between them (Figure 11.9 a). For open die, two dies having simple 
geometric shapes (e.g., parallel flat, semicircular) are employed, normally on large workpieces. Forged articles have outstanding grain structures and the best combination of mechanical properties. Wrenches, automotive crankshafts, and piston connecting rods are typical articles formed using this technique.
Rolling
Rolling, the most widely used deformation process, consists of passing a piece of metal between two rolls; a reduction in thickness results from compressive stresses exerted by the rolls. Cold rolling may be used in the production of sheet, strip, and foil with a high-quality surface finish. Circular shapes, as well as I-beams and railroad rails, are fabricated using grooved rolls.
Extrusion
For extrusion, a bar of metal is forced through a die orifice by a compressive force that 
is applied to a ram; the extruded piece that emerges has the desired shape and a reduced cross-sectional area. Extrusion products include rods and tubing that have rather com-plicated cross-sectional geometries; seamless tubing may also be extruded.
Drawing
Drawing is the pulling of a metal piece through a die having a tapered bore by means of a tensile force that is applied on the exit side. A reduction in cross section results, with a forging

corresponding increase in length. The total drawing operation may consist of a number 
of dies in a series sequence. Rod, wire, and tubing products are commonly fabricated in this way.
Casting is a fabrication process in which a completely molten metal is poured into a mold cavity having the desired shape; upon solidification, the metal assumes the shape of the mold but experiences some shrinkage. Casting techniques are employed when (1) the finished shape is so large or complicated that any other method would be impracti-cal; (2) a particular alloy is so low in ductility that forming by either hot or cold work-ing would be difficult; and (3) in comparison to other fabrication processes, casting is the most economical. The final step in the refining of even ductile metals may involve a casting process. A number of different casting techniques are commonly employed, including sand, die, investment, lost-foam, and continuous casting. Only a cursory treat-ment of each of these is offered.
Sand Casting
With sand casting, probably the most common method, ordinary sand is used as the mold material. A two-piece mold is formed by packing sand around a pattern that has the shape of the intended casting. A gating system is usually incorporated into the mold 
to expedite the flow of molten metal into the cavity and to minimize internal casting defects. Sand-cast parts include automotive cylinder blocks, fire hydrants, and large pipe fittings.
Die Casting
In die casting, the liquid metal is forced into a mold under pressure and at a relatively high velocity and allowed to solidify with the pressure maintained. A two-piece perma-nent steel mold or die is employed; when clamped together, the two pieces form the de-sired shape. When the metal has solidified completely, the die pieces are opened and the cast piece is ejected. Rapid casting rates are possible, making this an inexpensive method; furthermore, a single set of dies may be used for thousands of castings. However, this technique lends itself only to relatively small pieces and to alloys of zinc, aluminum, and magnesium, which have low melting temperatures.
Investment Casting
For investment (sometimes called lost-wax) casting, the pattern is made from a wax or plastic that has a low melting temperature. Around the pattern a fluid slurry is poured that sets up to form a solid mold or investment; plaster of paris is usually used. The mold is then heated, such that the pattern melts and is burned out, leaving behind a mold cavity having the desired shape. This technique is employed when high dimensional accuracy, reproduction of fine detail, and an excellent finish are required—for example, in jewelry and dental crowns and inlays. Also, blades for gas turbines and jet engine impellers are investment cast.
Lost-Foam Casting
A variation of investment casting is lost-foam (or expendable pattern) casting. Here, the expendable pattern is a foam that can be formed by compressing polystyrene beads into the desired shape and then bonding them together by heating. Alternatively, pattern 11.5 CASTING
376  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
shapes can be cut from sheets and assembled with glue. Sand is then packed around the 
pattern to form the mold. As the molten metal is poured into the mold, it replaces the pattern, which vaporizes. The compacted sand remains in place, and, upon solidification, the metal assumes the shape of the mold. With lost-foam casting, complex geometries and tight tolerances are possible. In comparison to sand casting, lost-foam casting is a simpler, quicker, and less expensive process and there are fewer environmental wastes. Metal alloys that most commonly use this technique are cast irons and aluminum alloys; furthermore, applications include au-tomobile engine blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, marine engine blocks, and electric motor frames.
Continuous Casting
At the conclusion of extraction processes, many molten metals are solidified by cast-ing into large ingot molds. The ingots are normally subjected to a primary hot-rolling operation, the product of which is a flat sheet or slab; these are more convenient shapes as starting points for subsequent secondary metal-forming operations (forging, extru-sion, drawing). These casting and rolling steps may be combined by a continuous cast-
ing (sometimes termed strand casting) process. Using this technique, the refined and molten metal is cast directly into a continuous strand that may have either a rectangular or circular cross section; solidification occurs in a water-cooled die having the desired cross-sectional geometry. The chemical composition and mechanical properties are more uniform throughout the cross sections for continuous castings than for ingot-cast products. Furthermore, continuous casting is highly automated and more efficient.
Powder Metallurgy
Yet another fabrication technique involves the compaction of powdered metal followed by a heat treatment to produce a denser piece. The process is appropriately called  powder metallurgy, frequently designated as P/M. Powder metallurgy makes it possible to produce a virtually nonporous piece having properties almost equivalent to those of the fully dense parent material. Diffusional processes during the heat treatment are central to the development of these properties. This method is especially suitable for metals having low ductilities, because only small plastic deformation of the powder particles need occur. Metals with high melting temperatures are difficult to melt and cast, and fabrication is expedited using P/M. In addition, parts that require very close dimensional tolerances (e.g., bushings and gears) may be economically produced using this technique.

 expensive or inconvenient. Both similar and dissimilar metals may be welded. The join-
ing bond is metallurgical (involving some diffusion) rather than just mechanical, as with riveting and bolting. A variety of welding methods exist, including arc and gas welding, as well as brazing and soldering. During arc and gas welding, the workpieces to be joined and the filler material (i.e., welding rod) are heated to a sufficiently high temperature to cause both to melt; upon solidification, the filler material forms a fusion joint between the workpieces. Thus, there is a region adjacent to the weld that may have experienced microstructural and property alterations; this region is termed the heat-affected zone (sometimes abbrevi-
ated HAZ). Possible alterations include the following:
 1. If the workpiece material was previously cold worked, this heat-affected zone 
may have experienced recrystallization and grain growth, and thus a decrease of strength, hardness, and toughness. The HAZ for this situation is represented sche-
matically in Figure 11.10.
 2. Upon cooling, residual stresses may form in this region that weaken the joint.
 3. For steels, the material in this zone may have been heated to temperatures suf-
ficiently high so as to form austenite. Upon cooling to room temperature, the 
microstructural products that form depend on cooling rate and alloy composition. For plain carbon steels, normally pearlite and a proeutectoid phase will be present. However, for alloy steels, one microstructural product may be martensite, which is ordinarily undesirable because it is so brittle.
 4. Some stainless steels may be “sensitized” during welding, which renders them sus-
ceptible to intergranular corrosion, as explained in Section 17.7.
 A relatively modern joining technique is that of laser beam welding, in which a highly focused and intense laser beam is used as the heat source. The laser beam melts the parent metal, and, upon solidification, a fusion joint is produced; often a filler ma-terial need not be used. Some of the advantages of this technique are as follows: (1) it is a noncontact process, which eliminates mechanical distortion of the workpieces; (2) it can be rapid and highly automated; (3) energy input to the workpiece is low, and therefore the heat-affected zone size is minimal; (4) welds may be small in size and very precise; (5) a large variety of metals and alloys may be joined using this technique; and (6) porosity-free welds with strengths equal to or in excess of the base metal are possi-ble. Laser beam welding is used extensively in the automotive and electronic industries, where high quality and rapid welding rates are required.

Over the past several years the manufacturing of materials industry has experienced a 
revolution with the introduction of what is termed three-dimensional or (3D) printing, 
also called additive manufacturing ( AM).1 The “additive” adjective denotes that a func-
tional object is created by the addition of raw material incrementally, often in a layer-like fashion, one layer at a time, from computer-aided design (CAD) data. This is in contrast to “subtractive” manufacturing technologies whereby components are formed by the removal of material such as with milling or machining. Some refer to the advent of AM as the beginning of a third industrial revolution (succeeding the production line assembly, second revolution). Additive manufacturing has also been characterized as a potentially disruptive technology; it will in all likelihood make some technologies obso-lete, as well as create new ones. In a sense, additive manufacturing operates in three dimensions similar to how inkjet/laser printers function in two—that is, a solid three-dimensional physical object is created from a digital model by “printing” a series of layers of material on top of one another. With AM, it is possible to create components having complex shapes and geometries that could not be produced using conventional manufacturing techniques. Customized, “one-of-a-kind,” products may be fabricated, cost effectively, and with short lead times. Any design changes are simply made digitally; no expensive or time-consuming retooling is required as with conventional manufacturing. In addition, with AM there is less waste; it normally uses only the amount of material required to fabri-cate the desired object. There are some drawbacks and trade-offs with AM. Costs are higher than conven-tional manufacturing for large production runs. Also, the number of available materi-als is somewhat limited and there are fewer color and finish choices. However, the 3D printing palette of materials is steadily increasing. Mechanical properties (e.g., strength and endurance) of 3D printed parts are often inferior to those manufactured using tradi-tional technologies. Furthermore, there is need for improved property and dimensional reproducibility from part to part for the same 3D printing machine and the same part for different machines. A variety of AM technologies, materials, and printer types are available; however, all rely on the same set of basic process flow protocols, which is represented schemati-cally in Figure 11.11. The first of these is to generate a digital and printable model (hav-ing the shape and appearance of the physical model), using either a computer-aided design (CAD) software package, a 3D scanner, or a digital camera in conjunction with photogrammetry software. If necessary, this digital model is next converted to another file format (the most common is “STL”), which defines the surface geometry of the solid model. This file is then processed by “slicer” software that cuts the model into many horizontal layers and produces a path the print head can follow line-by-line and layer-by-layer. The code in this software delivers instructions to the printer as it creates (or “prints”) the physical object. Finally, after printing, end-part finishing may be necessary (e.g., sanding and painting).11.7 3D PRINTING (ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING)
1The U. S. military prefers to use “direct digital manufacturing” (DDM) instead of 3D printing or additive manufacturing. 
In some countries the term “additive layer manufacturing” (ALM) is used.
11.7 3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing)   •  379
 All material types are amenable to 3D printing—metals, ceramics, polymers, and 
composites (also some foods—e.g., chocolate). Furthermore, feedstock materials may be supplied in the form of powders, suspensions, pastes, wires/filaments, or sheets, which will depend on the material, its properties, as well as the type of printer. Flow charac-teristics of the feedstock are critical for the deposition of layers having the required thickness (as determined by the printer head resolution). Printer type and technology will depend on class of material to be printed, and its characteristics. In the next section, we discuss techniques used primarily for metallic materials. The 3D printing of ceramics and polymers is treated in Sections 13.15 and 15.26, respectively.
3D Printing of Metallic Materials
With most 3D printing techniques used for metallic materials, the feedstock is in powder or wire form; an energy source is required to heat and/or melt the feedstock, which is typically either a laser or electron beam.
2 Electron beam processing takes place in a high 
vacuum. On the basis of how the feedstock is processed, most printing techniques fall into two classifications: direct energy deposition and powder bed fusion; subclassifica-tions are according to energy source type—laser or electron beam.
Direct Energy Deposition
For direct energy deposition (DED) technologies, a focused laser beam or beam 
of electrons melts the metal powder or wire as it is being deposited by a nozzle in layer fashion on the workpiece surface, where it solidifies (Figure 11.12). To facilitate this process, the nozzle is mounted on an arm that can move in multiple directions and deposit the fused metal from just about any angle. In a sense, DED is similar to con-ventional multipass welding techniques. Therefore, some of the processing parameters for these welding techniques are relevant to 3D printing (e.g., power requirements, the necessity of gas shielding, fusion speed).
2Other energy sources are those used for arc- and ultrasonic-welding.FINAL PRODUCT4

380  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
 Degree of homogeneity as well as development and uniformity of microstructure 
are important in determining the integrity of DED printed parts. During printing, chem-ical inhomogeneities and porosity may be introduced, deposited layers may re-melt, fusion may be incomplete, and phase transformations may occur. If adequate control of these factors is not possible, then additional postprocessing (such as hot isostatic press-ing) may be necessary.
Powder Bed Fusion
As its name implies, for powder bed fusion (PBF) the feedstock is supplied in pow-
der form. Components for this technology include a build platform, a powder supply, a powder spreader (roller or blade), a heat source (laser or electron beam), and pointing and focusing systems; these components as well as the PBF process are represented in the schematic diagram of Figure 11.13. The roller spreads a thin powder layer onto the 
build platform on top of a previously deposited layer. The laser/electron beam scans the powder bed and selectively melts or sinters
3 only those powder particles in this 
layer that are designated according to the tool path generated by the CAD model. In this manner, a solid, single layer having the cross section of the desired object is pro-duced. This process is repeated until the fabrication process is complete; all unmelted/unsintered powder that remains is recovered during a post-processing treatment, which may be used again.
 Metallic materials typically fabricated using 3D printing include the following: pure 
gold, copper, titanium, tantalum, and niobium, as well as alloys of aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, iron, and titanium. Current applications of 3D-printed metallic materials are concentrated in biomedical and aerospace industries.

3The process of sintering is described for ceramic materials in Section 13.13 (Figure 13.23).  Upon heating, the powder 
does not melt; however, powder particles touching one another coalesce (grow together).  Thus, a solid and dense mass 
is ultimately formed from this bed of powder particles.  When a laser beam energy source is used, the process is termed selective laser sintering (SLS).

and undoubtedly will continue to escalate dramatically. Some current and potential 
applications of 3D printing are as follows:
• Automotive—The day may come when automobiles are manufactured completely 
using 3D printing technologies. In fact, in 2014, a functioning two-person, electric vehicle was entirely (with the exception of the powertrain) 3D printed in 40 hours. At present, many automobile manufacturers are using commercial 3D printers to produce prototype parts that are identical to mass-produced replacement parts, which are more expensive to manufacture and require the maintaining of back-stock inventories. In addition, it is possible to print parts for outdated and antique models.
• Aircraft and Aerospace—A number of aircraft and aerospace components are 
currently being 3D printed, especially engine parts that have complex shapes—for example, fuel nozzles and engine chambers. Furthermore, engine designs are more streamlined, which result in fuel savings and increases in power. Other 3D printed parts include liquid and fuel tanks, air fl  ow ducts, and some control surfaces.
• Architecture—Using 3D printing, architects create scale models of buildings 
directly from CAD data that were used for generating blueprints.
• Medical—Customized 3D printed medical products include hearing aids, knee and 
hip replacement parts, surgical instruments, cast replacements, braces, prosthetic limbs, facial implants, and surgical guides.
• Biomedical—The ability to design and create complex and intricate biomedical 
devices is critical in the engineering and regeneration of tissues. For example, stem cells may be “seeded” into 3D-fabricated microarchitectural biodegrad-able scaffolds (support structures), which, when cultivated properly, become living tissue. This tissue is then implanted in the body to restore the function of diseased or injured tissue. Controlled-release drugs may also be 3D printed. Powder delivery

382  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
Earlier chapters discussed a number of phenomena that occur in metals and alloys at 
elevated temperatures—for example, recrystallization and the decomposition of austenite. These are effective in altering the mechanical characteristics when appropriate heat treatments or thermal processes are used. In fact, the use of heat treatments on commer-cial alloys is an exceedingly common practice. Therefore, we consider next the details of some of these processes, including annealing procedures, the heat treating of steels, and precipitation hardening.Thermal Processing of Metals
The term annealing refers to a heat treatment in which a material is exposed to an elevated temperature for an extended time period and then slowly cooled. Typically, annealing is carried out to (1) relieve stresses; (2) increase softness, ductility, and tough-ness; and/or (3) produce a specific microstructure. A variety of annealing heat treat-ments are possible; they are characterized by the changes that are induced, which often are microstructural and are responsible for the alteration of the mechanical properties. Any annealing process consists of three stages: (1) heating to the desired tem-perature, (2) holding or “soaking” at that temperature, and (3) cooling, usually to room temperature. Time is an important parameter in these procedures. During heating and cooling, temperature gradients exist between the outside and interior portions of the piece; their magnitudes depend on the size and geometry of the piece. If the rate of temperature change is too great, temperature gradients and internal stresses may be induced that may lead to warping or even cracking. Also, the actual annealing time must be long enough to allow for any necessary transformation reactions. Annealing tem-perature is also an important consideration; annealing may be accelerated by increasing the temperature because diffusional processes are normally involved.
Process Annealing
Process annealing is a heat treatment that is used to negate the effects of cold work—that is, to soften and increase the ductility of a previously strain-hardened metal. It is com-monly used during fabrication procedures that require extensive plastic deformation, to allow a continuation of deformation without fracture or excessive energy consumption. Recovery and recrystallization processes are allowed to occur. Typically, a fine-grained annealing

organs by the 3D printing of human tissue as cells are deposited in layer-by-
layer fashion.
• Dental—From the 3D scan of a patient’s jaw and teeth it is possible to accurately 
3D print a wide variety of customized dental products such as orthodontic appli-ances, crowns, bridges, implants, veneers, inlays, night guards, and dentures.
• Shoes—Several shoe companies 3D print personalized pairs of shoes (in-store) 
that fi  t their customers’ feet perfectly. In addition, a customized running shoe with a 3D-printed midsole is available that consists of printed layers of an elastomeric material. These shoes have fl  exibility, strength, and cushioning that are tailored to the needs of the person who wears them.
• Clothes—In the not too distant future, many of us will be wearing 3D-printed, 
custom-made, and personalized clothing. Ready-to-wear garments will be ordered online, and printed from raw materials in a single manufacturing operation, within a matter of hours. These garments will be totally personalized; they will fi  t you 
perfectly, with very few constraints as to style and color. Polymer textile materials are currently being developed that can be 3D printed into wearing apparel.

preciable grain growth has occurred. Surface oxidation or scaling may be prevented or minimized by annealing at a relatively low temperature (but above the recrystallization temperature) or in a nonoxidizing atmosphere.
Stress Relief
Internal residual stresses may develop in metal pieces in response to the following: (1) plastic deformation processes such as machining and grinding; (2) nonuniform cool-ing of a piece that was processed or fabricated at an elevated temperature, such as a weld or a casting; and (3) a phase transformation that is induced upon cooling in which parent and product phases have different densities. Distortion and warpage may result if these residual stresses are not removed. They may be eliminated by a stress relief an-
nealing heat treatment in which the piece is heated to the recommended temperature, held there long enough to attain a uniform temperature, and finally cooled to room temperature in air. The annealing temperature is typically a relatively low one such that effects resulting from cold working and other heat treatments are not affected.
Annealing of Ferrous Alloys
Several different annealing procedures are employed to enhance the properties of steel alloys. However, before they are discussed, some comment relative to the labeling of phase boundaries is necessary. Figure 11.14 shows the portion of the iron–iron carbide phase diagram in the vicinity of the eutectoid. The horizontal line at the eutectoid temperature, conventionally labeled A
1, is termed the lower critical temperature, be-
low which, under equilibrium conditions, all austenite has transformed into ferrite and cementite phases. The phase boundaries denoted as A
3 and Acm represent the upper 
critical temperature lines for hypoeutectoid and hypereutectoid steels, respectively. For 
temperatures and compositions above these boundaries, only the austenite phase pre-
vails. As explained in Section 9.20, other alloying elements shift the eutectoid and the positions of these phase boundary lines.
Normalizing
 Steels that have been plastically deformed by, for example, a rolling operation consist of grains of pearlite (and most likely a proeutectoid phase), which are irregularly shaped and relatively large and vary substantially in size. An annealing heat treatment called normalizing is used to refine the grains (i.e., to decrease the average grain size) 
and produce a more uniform and desirable size distribution; fine-grained pearlitic steels are tougher than coarse-grained ones. Normalizing is accomplished by heating at least stress relief

55°C (100°F) above the upper critical temperature—that is, above A3 for compositions 
less than the eutectoid (0.76 wt% C), and above Acm for compositions greater than the 
eutectoid, as represented in Figure 11.14. After sufficient time has been allowed for the 
alloy to completely transform to austenite—a procedure termed austenitizing —the treat-
ment is terminated by cooling in air. A normalizing cooling curve is superimposed on the continuous-cooling transformation diagram (Figure 10.27).
Full Anneal
 A heat treatment known as full annealing is often used in low- and medium-carbon steels that will be machined or will experience extensive plastic deformation during a forming operation. In general, the alloy is treated by heating to a temperature of about 50°C above the A
3 line (to form austenite) for compositions less than the eutectoid, or, 
for compositions in excess of the eutectoid, 50 °C above the A1 line (to form austenite 
and Fe3C phases), as noted in Figure 11.14. The alloy is then furnace cooled—that is, the 
heat-treating furnace is turned off, and both furnace and steel cool to room temperature at the same rate, which takes several hours. The microstructural product of this anneal is coarse pearlite (in addition to any proeutectoid phase) that is relatively soft and duc-tile. The full-anneal cooling procedure (also shown in Figure 10.27) is time consuming; however, a microstructure having small grains and a uniform grain  structure results.
Spheroidizing
 Medium- and high-carbon steels having a microstructure containing even coarse pearlite may still be too hard to machine or plastically deform conveniently. These steels, and in fact any steel, may be heat-treated or annealed to develop the spheroidite structure as described in Section 10.5. Spheroidized steels have a maximum softness and ductility and are easily machined or deformed. The spheroidizing heat treatment, during 
which there is a coalescence of the Fe
3C to form the spheroid particles, can take place 
by several methods, as follows:
• Heating the alloy at a temperature just below the eutectoid [line A1 in Figure 11.14, 
or at about 700°C (1300°F)] in the 𝛼 + Fe3C region of the phase diagram. If the 
precursor microstructure contains pearlite, spheroidizing times will typically range between 15 and 25 h.
• Heating to a temperature just above the eutectoid temperature and then either 
cooling very slowly in the furnace or holding at a temperature just below the eutec-toid temperature.
• Heating and cooling alternately within about ±50°C of the A
1 line of Figure 11.14.
 To some degree, the rate at which spheroidite forms depends on prior microstruc-ture. For example, it is slowest for pearlite, and the finer the pearlite, the more rapid the rate. Also, prior cold work increases the spheroidizing reaction rate.
 Still other annealing treatments are possible. For example, glasses are annealed, as 
outlined in Section 13.11 to remove residual internal stresses that render the material excessively weak. In addition, microstructural alterations and the attendant modifica-tion of mechanical properties of cast irons, as discussed in Section 11.2, result from what are, in a sense, annealing treatments.austenitizing

Conventional heat treatment procedures for producing martensitic steels typically in-
volve continuous and rapid cooling of an austenitized specimen in some type of quench-ing medium, such as water, oil, or air. The optimum properties of a steel that has been quenched and then tempered can be realized only if, during the quenching heat treatment, 11.9 HEAT TREATMENT OF STEELS

(a)(b)the specimen has been converted to a high content of martensite; the formation of any 
pearlite and/or bainite will result in other than the best combination of mechanical characteristics. During the quenching treatment, it is impossible to cool the specimen at a uniform rate throughout—the surface always cools more rapidly than interior regions. Therefore, the austenite transforms over a range of temperatures, yielding a possible variation of microstructure and properties with position within a specimen. The successful heat treating of steels to produce a predominantly martensitic micro-structure throughout the cross section depends mainly on three factors: (1) the composi-tion of the alloy, (2) the type and character of the quenching medium, and (3) the size and shape of the specimen. The influence of each of these factors is now addressed.
Hardenability
The influence of alloy composition on the ability of a steel alloy to transform to mar-tensite for a particular quenching treatment is related to a parameter called harden-
ability. For every steel alloy, there is a specific relationship between the mechanical properties and the cooling rate. Hardenability is a term used to describe the ability of an 
alloy to be hardened by the formation of martensite as a result of a given heat treatment. Hardenability is not “hardness,” which is the resistance to indentation; rather, harden-ability is a qualitative measure of the rate at which hardness drops off with distance into the interior of a specimen as a result of diminished martensite content. A steel alloy that has a high hardenability is one that hardens, or forms martensite, not only at the surface, but also to a large degree throughout the entire interior.
The Jominy End-Quench Test
 One standard procedure widely used to determine hardenability is the Jominy  end-quench test.
4 With this procedure, except for alloy composition, all factors that 
may influence the depth to which a piece hardens (i.e., specimen size and shape and quenching treatment) are maintained constant. A cylindrical specimen 25.4 mm (1.0 in.) in diameter and 100 mm (4 in.) long is austenitized at a prescribed temperature for a prescribed time. After removal from the furnace, it is quickly mounted in a fixture as diagrammed in Figure 11.15 a. The lower end is quenched by a jet of water of specified hardenability

flow rate and temperature. Thus, the cooling rate is a maximum at the quenched end 
and diminishes with position from this point along the length of the specimen. After the piece has cooled to room temperature, shallow flats 0.4 mm (0.015 in.) deep are ground along the specimen length and Rockwell hardness measurements are made for the first 50 mm (2 in.) along each flat (Figure 11.15 b); for the first 12.8 mm (
1
2 in.),  hardness 
readings are taken at 1.6-mm (1
16 in.) intervals, and for the remaining 38.4 mm (11
2 in.),  
every 3.2 mm (1
8 in.).  A hardenability curve is produced when hardness is plotted as a 
function of position from the quenched end.
Hardenability Curves
 A typical hardenability curve is represented in Figure 11.16. The quenched end is cooled most rapidly and exhibits the maximum hardness; 100% martensite is the product at this position for most steels. Cooling rate decreases with distance from the quenched end, and the hardness also decreases, as indicated in the figure. With diminishing cooling rate, more time is allowed for carbon diffusion and the formation of a greater proportion of the softer pearlite, which may be mixed with martensite and bainite. Thus, a steel that is highly hardenable retains large hardness values for relatively long distances; a steel with low hardenability does not. Also, each steel alloy has its own unique hardenability curve. Sometimes, it is convenient to relate hardness to a cooling rate rather than to the location from the quenched end of a standard Jominy specimen. Cooling rate [taken at 700°C (1300°F)] is typically shown on the upper horizontal axis of a hardenability diagram; this scale is included with the hardenability plots presented here. This cor-relation between position and cooling rate is the same for plain carbon steels and many alloy steels because the rate of heat transfer is nearly independent of composition. On occasion, cooling rate or position from the quenched end is specified in terms of Jominy distance, one Jominy distance unit being 1.6 mm (
1
16 in.).
 A correlation may be drawn between position along the Jominy specimen and  continuous-cooling transformations. For example, Figure 11.17 is a continuous-cooling transformation diagram for a eutectoid iron–carbon alloy onto which are superimposed the cooling curves at four different Jominy positions together with the corresponding microstructures that result for each. The hardenability curve for this alloy is also included. Figure 11.18 shows the hardenability curves for five different steel alloys all having 0.40 wt% C, but differing amounts of other alloying elements. One specimen is a plain carbon steel (1040); the other four (4140, 4340, 5140, and 8640) are alloy steels. The compositions of the four alloy steels are included within the figure. The significance of the alloy designation numbers (e.g., 1040) is explained in Section 11.2. Several details are worth noting from this figure. First, all five alloys have identical hardnesses at the quenched end (57 HRC); this hardness is a function of carbon content only, which is the same for all of these alloys.Distance from quenched endHardness, HRCFigure 11.16  Typical harden-

 Probably the most significant feature of these curves is shape, which relates to 
hardenability. The hardenability of the plain carbon 1040 steel is low because the hardness drops off precipitously (to about 30 HRC) after a relatively short Jominy dis-tance (16.4 mm, 
1
4 in.).  By way of contrast, the decreases in hardness for the other four 
 alloy steels are distinctly more gradual. For example, at a Jominy distance of 50 mm (2 in.), the hardnesses of the 4340 and 8640 alloys are approximately 50 and 32 HRC, respectively; thus, of these two alloys, the 4340 is more hardenable. A water-quenched specimen of the 1040 plain carbon steel would harden only to a shallow depth below the surface, whereas for the other four alloy steels the high quenched hardness would persist to a much greater depth. The hardness profiles in Figure 11.18 are indicative of the influence of cooling rate on the microstructure. At the quenched end, where the quenching rate is approximately 600°C/s (1100°F/s), 100% martensite is present for all five alloys. For cooling rates less than about 70°C/s (125°F/s) or Jominy distances greater than about 6.4 mm (
1
4 in.),  the 
microstructure of the 1040 steel is predominantly pearlitic, with some proeutectoid  ferrite. However, the microstructures of the four alloy steels consist primarily of a mix-ture of martensite and bainite; bainite content increases with decreasing cooling rate. This disparity in hardenability behavior for the five alloys in Figure 11.18 is ex-plained by the presence of nickel, chromium, and molybdenum in the alloy steels. These alloying elements delay the austenite-to-pearlite and/or bainite reactions, as explained 
388  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
previously; this permits more martensite to form for a particular cooling rate, yielding a 
greater hardness. The right-hand axis of Figure 11.18 shows the approximate percentage of martensite that is present at various hardnesses for these alloys. The hardenability curves also depend on carbon content. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 11.19 for a series of alloy steels in which only the concentration of carbon is varied. The hardness at any Jominy position increases with the concentration of carbon.Figure 11.18  Hardenability curves for

11.9 Heat Treatment of Steels   •  389
 Also, during the industrial production of steel, there is always a slight, unavoidable 
variation in composition and average grain size from one batch to another. This varia-tion results in some scatter in measured hardenability data, which frequently are plotted as a band representing the maximum and minimum values that would be expected for the particular alloy. Such a hardenability band is plotted in Figure 11.20 for an 8640 steel. An H following the designation specification for an alloy (e.g., 8640H) indicates that the composition and characteristics of the alloy are such that its hardenability curve lies within a specified band.
Influence of Quenching Medium, Specimen 
Size, and Geometry
The preceding treatment of hardenability discussed the influence of both alloy compo-
sition and cooling or quenching rate on the hardness. The cooling rate of a specimen depends on the rate of heat energy extraction, which is a function of the characteristics of the quenching medium in contact with the specimen surface, as well as of the speci-men size and geometry. Severity of quench is a term often used to indicate the rate of cooling; the more rapid the quench, the more severe is the quench. Of the three most common quench-ing media—water, oil, and air—water produces the most severe quench, followed by oil, which is more effective than air.
5 The degree of agitation of each medium also influences 
the rate of heat removal. Increasing the velocity of the quenching medium across the specimen surface enhances the quenching effectiveness. Oil quenches are suitable for the heat treating of many alloy steels. In fact, for higher-carbon steels, a water quench is Figure 11.20  The hardenability band for an 
8640 steel indicating maximum and minimum

5Aqueous polymer quenchants [solutions composed of water and a polymer—normally poly(alkylene glycol) or

too severe because cracking and warping may be produced. Air cooling of austenitized 
plain carbon steels ordinarily produces an almost totally pearlitic structure. During the quenching of a steel specimen, heat energy must be transported to the surface before it can be dissipated into the quenching medium. As a consequence, the cooling rate within and throughout the interior of a steel structure varies with position and depends on the geometry and size. Figures 11.21 a and 11.21b show the quenching 
rate at 700°C (1300°F) as a function of diameter for cylindrical bars at four radial posi-tions (surface, three-quarters radius, midradius, and center). Quenching is in mildly agitated water (Figure 11.21a) and oil (Figure 11.21b); cooling rate is also expressed as equivalent Jominy distance because these data are often used in conjunction with hard-enability curves. Diagrams similar to those in Figure 11.21 have also been generated for geometries other than cylindrical (e.g., flat plates). One utility of such diagrams is in the prediction of the hardness traverse along the cross section of a specimen. For example, Figure 11.22a compares the radial hardness distributions for cylindrical plain carbon (1040) and alloy (4140) steel specimens; both have a diameter of 50 mm (2 in.) and are water quenched. The difference in hardenabil-ity is evident from these two profiles. Specimen diameter also influences the hardness distribution, as demonstrated in Figure 11.22 b, which plots the hardness profiles for oil-
quenched 4140 cylinders 50 and 75 mm (2 and 3 in.) in diameter. Example Problem 11.1 illustrates how these hardness profiles are determined.Figure 11.21  Cooling rate as a function of the diameter at the surface, the three-quarter radius (3

11.9 Heat Treatment of Steels  •   391
 As far as specimen shape is concerned, because the heat energy is dissipated to 
the quenching medium at the specimen surface, the rate of cooling for a particular quenching treatment depends on the ratio of surface area to the mass of the specimen. The larger this ratio, the more rapid the cooling rate and, consequently, the deeper the hardening effect. Irregular shapes with edges and corners have larger surface-to-mass ratios than regular and rounded shapes (e.g., spheres and cylinders) and are thus more amenable to hardening by quenching. A multitude of steels are responsive to a martensitic heat treatment, and one of the most important criteria in the selection process is hardenability. Hardenability curves, when used in conjunction with plots such as those in Figure 11.21 for various quenching media, may be used to ascertain the suitability of a specific steel alloy for a particular application. Conversely, the appropriateness of a quenching procedure for an alloy may be determined. For parts that are to be involved in relatively high stress applications, a minimum of 80% martensite must be produced throughout the interior as a conse-quence of the quenching procedure. Only a 50% minimum is required for moderately stressed parts.Figure 11.22  Radial hardness profiles for (a) 50-mm- (2-in.-) diameter cylindrical 1040 and 4140 steel specimens

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 11.1
Determination of Hardness Profile for Heat-Treated 1040 Steel
Determine the radial hardness profile for a cylin-
drical specimen of 1040 steel of diameter 50 mm (2 in.) that has been quenched in moderately agitated water.
Solution
First, evaluate the cooling rate (in terms of the 
Jominy end-quench distance) at center, surface, midradius, and three-quarter radius positions of the cylindrical specimen. This is accomplished using the cooling rate–versus–bar diameter plot for the appropriate quenching medium—in this case, Figure 11.21a. Then, convert the cooling rate at each of these radial positions into a hardness value from a hardenability plot for the particular alloy. Finally, determine the hardness profile by plotting the hardness as a function of radial posi-tion. This procedure is demonstrated in Figure 11.23, for the center position. Note that for a water-quenched cylinder of 50 mm (2 in.) diameter, the cooling rate at the center is equivalent to that approximately 9.5 mm 
(3
8  in.) from the Jominy 
specimen quenched end (Figure 11.23a ). This cor-

DESIGN EXAMPLE 11.1
Steel Alloy and Heat Treatment Selection
It is necessary to select a steel alloy for a gearbox output shaft. The design calls for a 1-in.-
diameter cylindrical shaft having a surface hardness of at least 38 HRC and a minimum ductility of 12%EL. Specify an alloy and treatment that meet these criteria.
Solution
First, cost is also most likely an important design consideration. This would probably elimi-
nate relatively expensive steels, such as stainless steels and those that are precipitation hard-enable. Therefore, let us begin by examining plain carbon steels and low-alloy steels and what treatments are available to alter their mechanical characteristics. It is unlikely that merely cold working one of these steels would produce the desired combination of hardness and ductility. For example, from Figure 6.19, a hardness of 38 HRC corresponds to a tensile strength of 1200 MPa (175,000 psi). The tensile strength as a function of percent cold work for a 1040 steel is represented in Figure 7.19 b. Here it may be noted that 
at 50%CW, a tensile strength of only about 900 MPa (130,000 psi) is achieved; furthermore, the corresponding ductility is approximately 10%EL (Figure 7.19 c). Hence, both of these proper-
ties fall short of those specified in the design; in addition, cold working other plain carbon steels or low-alloy steels would probably not achieve the required minimum values. Another possibility is to perform a series of heat treatments in which the steel is austeni-tized, quenched (to form martensite), and finally tempered. Let us now examine the mechanical properties of various plain carbon steels and low-alloy steels that have been heat-treated in this manner. The surface hardness of the quenched material (which ultimately affects the tempered hardness) depends on both alloy content and shaft diameter, as discussed in the previous two sections. For example, the degree to which surface hardness decreases with diameter is repre-sented in Table 11.12 for a 1060 steel that was oil quenched. The tempered surface hardness also depends on tempering temperature and time. As-quenched and tempered hardness and ductility data were collected for one plain carbon steel (AISI/SAE 1040) and several common and readily available low-alloy steels, data for which are presented in Table 11.13. The quenching medium (either oil or water) is indicated, and tempering temperatures were 540°C (1000°F), 595°C (1100°F), and 650°C (1200°F). As may be noted, the only alloy–heat treatment combinations that meet the stipulated criteria are 4150/oil–540°C temper, 4340/oil–540°C temper, and 6150/oil–540°C temper; data for these alloys/heat treatments are boldfaced in the table. The costs of these three materials are probably comparable; however, a cost analysis should be conducted.

 As the previous section notes, for cylindrical steel alloy specimens that have been 
quenched, surface hardness depends not only upon alloy composition and quenching medium, but also upon specimen diameter. Likewise, the mechanical characteristics of steel specimens that have been quenched and subsequently tempered will also be a func-tion of specimen diameter. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 11.24, which, for an oil-quenched 4140 steel, plots tensile strength, yield strength, and ductility (%EL) ver-sus tempering temperature for four diameters—12.5 mm (0.5 in.), 25 mm (1 in.), 50 mm (2 in.), and 100 mm (4 in.).
 At this time, we have completed our commentary on the various types of steel 
alloys—their heat treatments, microstructures, and properties—discussions found in Chapters 9 and 10, as well as the present chapter. We have compiled a summary of this information, which is presented in the schematic diagram of Figure 11.25.
The strength and hardness of some metal alloys may be enhanced by the formation of extremely small, uniformly dispersed particles of a second phase within the original phase matrix; this must be accomplished by phase transformations that are induced by appropriate heat treatments. The process is called precipitation hardening because 
the  small particles of the new phase are termed precipitates. Age hardening is also 
used  to designate this procedure because the strength develops with time, or as the alloy  ages. Examples of alloys that are hardened by precipitation treatments include aluminum–copper, copper–beryllium, copper–tin, and magnesium–aluminum; some  ferrous alloys are also precipitation hardenable. Precipitation hardening and the treating of steel to form tempered martensite are totally different phenomena, even though the heat treatment procedures are similar;

it a slight edge in the selection process.

microstructural constituents, and typical mechanical properties.
therefore, the processes should not be confused. The principal difference lies in the 
mechanisms by which hardening and strengthening are achieved. These should become apparent with the following explanation of precipitation hardening.
Heat Treatments
Inasmuch as precipitation hardening results from the development of particles of a new phase, an explanation of the heat treatment procedure is facilitated by use of a phase diagram. Even though, in practice, many precipitation-hardenable alloys contain two or more alloying elements, the discussion is simplified by reference to a binary system. The phase diagram must be of the form shown for the hypothetical A–B system in Figure 11.26.
11.10 Precipitation Hardening   •  397
 Two requisite features must be displayed by the phase diagrams of alloy systems 
for precipitation hardening: an appreciable maximum solubility of one component in the other, on the order of several percent; and a solubility limit that rapidly decreases in concentration of the major component with temperature reduction. Both of these conditions are satisfied by this hypothetical phase diagram (Figure 11.26). The maximum solubility corresponds to the composition at point M. In addition, the solubility 
limit boundary between the 𝛼 and 𝛼 + 𝛽 phase fields diminishes from this maximum 
concentration to a very low B content in A at point N. Furthermore, the composition of 
a precipitation-hardenable alloy must be less than the maximum solubility. These con-ditions are necessary but not sufficient for precipitation hardening to occur in an alloy 
system. An additional requirement is discussed in what follows.
Solution Heat Treating
 Precipitation hardening is accomplished by two different heat treatments. The first is a solution heat treatment in which all solute atoms are dissolved to form a single-
phase solid solution. Consider an alloy of composition C
0 in Figure 11.26. The treatment 
consists of heating the alloy to a temperature within the 𝛼-phase field—say, T0—and 
waiting until all of the 𝛽 phase that may have been present is completely dissolved. 
At this point, the alloy consists only of an 𝛼 phase of composition C0. This procedure 
is followed by rapid cooling or quenching to temperature T1, which for many alloys is 
room temperature, to the extent that any diffusion and the accompanying formation of 
any of the 𝛽 phase are prevented. Thus, a nonequilibrium situation exists in which only 
the 𝛼-phase solid solution supersaturated with B atoms is present at T1; in this state the 
alloy is relatively soft and weak. Furthermore, for most alloys diffusion rates at T1 are 
extremely slow, such that the single 𝛼 phase is retained at this temperature for relatively 
long periods.
Precipitation Heat Treating
 For the second or precipitation heat treatment, the supersaturated 𝛼 solid solu-
tion is  ordinarily heated to an intermediate temperature T2 (Figure 11.26) within the 
𝛼 + 𝛽 two-phase region, at which temperature diffusion rates become appreciable. 
The 𝛽 precipitate phase begins to form as finely dispersed particles of composition C𝛽, 
which process is sometimes termed aging. After the appropriate aging time at T2, the 
alloy is cooled to room temperature; normally, this cooling rate is not an important consideration. Both solution and precipitation heat treatments are represented on the temperature-versus-time plot in Figure 11.27. The character of these 𝛽 particles, and 
subsequently the strength and hardness of the alloy, depend on both the precipitation solution heat

temperature T2 and the aging time at this temperature. For some alloys, aging occurs 
spontaneously at room temperature over extended time periods.
 The dependence of the growth of the precipitate 𝛽 particles on time and tem-
perature under isothermal heat treatment conditions may be represented by C-shape curves similar to those in Figure 10.18 for the eutectoid transformation in steels. However, it is more useful and convenient to present the data as tensile strength, yield strength, or hardness at room temperature as a function of the logarithm of aging time, at constant temperature T
2. The behavior for a typical precipitation-
hardenable alloy is represented schematically in Figure 11.28. With increasing time, the strength or hardness increases, reaches a maximum, and finally diminishes. This reduction in strength and hardness that occurs after long time periods is known as 
overaging. The influence of temperature is incorporated by the superposition, on a 
single plot, of curves at a variety of temperatures.
Mechanism of Hardening
Precipitation hardening is commonly employed with high-strength aluminum alloys. 
Although a large number of these alloys have different proportions and combinations of alloying elements, the mechanism of hardening has perhaps been studied most extensively for the aluminum–copper alloys. Figure 11.29 presents the aluminum-rich portion of the aluminum–copper phase diagram. The 𝛼 phase is a substitutional overagingFigure 11.28  Schematic

designated the 𝜃 phase. For an aluminum–copper alloy of, say, composition 96 wt% 
Al–4 wt% Cu, in the development of this equilibrium 𝜃 phase during the precipitation 
heat treatment, several transition phases are first formed in a specific sequence. The 
mechanical properties are influenced by the character of the particles of these transi-tion phases. During the initial hardening stage (at short times, Figure 11.28), copper atoms cluster together in very small, thin discs that are only one or two atoms thick and approximately 25 atoms in diameter; these form at countless positions within the 
𝛼 phase. The clusters, sometimes called zones, are so small that they are really not 
regarded as distinct precipitate particles. However, with time and the subsequent diffusion of copper atoms, zones become particles as they increase in size. These precipitate particles then pass through two transition phases (denoted as 𝜃″ and 𝜃′), 
before the formation of the equilibrium 𝜃 phase (Figure 11.30c ). Transition phase 
particles for a precipitation-hardened 7150 aluminum alloy are shown in the electron micrograph of Figure 11.31. The strengthening and hardening effects shown in Figure 11.28 result from the in-numerable particles of these transition and metastable phases.

maximum strength coincides with the formation of the 𝜃″ phase, which may be pre-
served upon cooling the alloy to room temperature. Overaging results from continued 
particle growth and the development of 𝜃′ and 𝜃 phases.
 The strengthening process is accelerated as the temperature is increased. This is demonstrated in Figure 11.32a, a plot of tensile strength versus the logarithm of time for a 2014 aluminum alloy at several different precipitation temperatures. Ideally, tem-perature and time for the precipitation heat treatment should be designed to produce a hardness or strength in the vicinity of the maximum. Associated with an increase in strength is a reduction in ductility, which is demonstrated in Figure 11.32 b for the same 
2014 aluminum alloy at the same temperatures. Not all alloys that satisfy the aforementioned conditions relative to composition and phase diagram configuration are amenable to precipitation hardening. In addition,

Summary  •   401
lattice strains must be established at the precipitate–matrix interface. For aluminum–
copper alloys, there is a distortion of the crystal lattice structure around and within the vicinity of particles of these transition phases (Figure 11.30 b). During plastic deforma-
tion, dislocation motions are effectively impeded as a result of these distortions, and, consequently, the alloy becomes harder and stronger. As the 𝜃 phase forms, the resul-
tant overaging (softening and weakening) is explained by a reduction in the resistance to slip that is offered by these precipitate particles. Alloys that experience appreciable precipitation hardening at room temperature and after relatively short time periods must be quenched to and stored under refrigerated conditions. Several aluminum alloys that are used for rivets exhibit this behavior. They are driven while still soft, then allowed to age harden at the normal ambient temperature. This is termed natural aging; artificial aging  is carried out at elevated  temperatures.
Miscellaneous Considerations
The combined effects of strain hardening and precipitation hardening may be employed in high-strength alloys. The order of these hardening procedures is important in the production of alloys having the optimum combination of mechanical properties. Normally, the alloy is solution heat-treated and then quenched. This is followed by cold working and finally by the precipitation-hardening heat treatment. In the final treatment, little strength loss is sustained as a result of recrystallization. If the alloy is precipitation hardened before cold working, more energy must be expended in its deformation; in addition, cracking may also result because of the reduction in ductility that accompanies the precipitation hardening. Most precipitation-hardened alloys are limited in their maximum service tempera-tures. Exposure to temperatures at which aging occurs may lead to a loss of strength due to overaging.natural aging,

SUMMARY
• Ferrous alloys (steels and cast irons) are those in which iron is the prime constituent. 
Most steels contain less than 1.0 wt% C and, in addition, other alloying elements, which render them susceptible to heat treatment (and an enhancement of mechanical properties) and/or more corrosion resistant.
• Ferrous alloys are used extensively as engineering materials because
Iron-bearing compounds are abundant.Economical extraction, refining, and fabrication techniques are available.They may be tailored to have a wide variety of mechanical and physical properties.
• Limitations of ferrous alloys include the following:
Relatively high densitiesComparatively low electrical conductivitiesSusceptibility to corrosion in common environments
• The most common types of steels are plain low-carbon, high-strength low-alloy, 
medium-carbon, tool, and stainless.
• Plain carbon steels contain (in addition to carbon) a little manganese and only residual 
concentrations of other impurities.
• Stainless steels are classified according to the main microstructural constituent. The 
three classes are ferritic, austenitic, and martensitic.
• Cast irons contain higher carbon contents than steels—normally between 3.0 and 4.5 
wt% C—as well as other alloying elements, notably silicon. For these materials, most of the carbon exists in graphite form rather than combined with iron as cementite.
• Gray, ductile (or nodular), malleable, and compacted graphite irons are the four most 
widely used cast irons; the last three are reasonably ductile.Ferrous Alloys
402  •   Chapter 11  /  Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys
• All other alloys fall within the nonferrous category, which is further subdivided ac-
cording to base metal or some distinctive characteristic that is shared by a group of 
alloys.
• Seven classifications of nonferrous alloys were discussed—copper, aluminum, magne-
sium, titanium, the refractory metals, the superalloys, and the noble metals—as well as a miscellaneous category (nickel, lead, tin, zinc, and zirconium).Nonferrous Alloys
• Forming operations are those in which a metal piece is shaped by plastic deformation.
• When deformation is carried out above the recrystallization temperature, it is termed 
hot working; otherwise, it is cold working.
• Forging, rolling, extrusion, and drawing are among the more common forming tech-
niques (Figure 11.9).Forming Operations
• Depending on the properties and shape of the finished piece, casting may be the most 
desirable and economical fabrication process.
• The most common casting techniques are sand, die, investment, lost-foam, and con-
tinuous casting.Casting
• Powder metallurgy involves compacting powder metal particles into a desired shape, 
which is then densified by heat treatment. P/M is used primarily for metals that have low ductilities and/or high melting temperatures.
• Welding is used to join together two or more workpieces; a fusion bond forms by 
melting portions of the workpieces and, in some instances, a filler material.Miscellaneous 
Techniques
• 3D printing (or additive manufacturing), a new and revolutionary technology, is used 
to fabricate metals and their alloys. Three-dimensional objects are created by “print-ing” a series of layers of one material on top of another. Customized, one-of-a-kind parts are produced, cost effectively, and with short lead times.
• Two 3D printing techniques used for metallic materials are direct energy deposition 
and powder bed fusion. The energy source for both techniques is either a laser or an electron beam.3D Printing
• Annealing is the exposure of a material to an elevated temperature for an extended time period followed by cooling to room temperature at a relatively slow rate.
• During process annealing, a cold-worked piece is rendered softer yet more ductile as 
a consequence of recrystallization.
• Internal residual stresses that have been introduced are eliminated during a stress-
relief anneal.
• For ferrous alloys, normalizing is used to refine and improve the grain structure.Annealing Processes
• For high-strength steels, the best combination of mechanical characteristics may be 
realized if a predominantly martensitic microstructure is developed over the entire cross section; this is converted into tempered martensite during a tempering heat treatment.
• Hardenability is a parameter used to ascertain the influence of composition on the susceptibility to the formation of a predominantly martensitic structure for some specific heat treatment.
• Determination of hardenability is accomplished by the standard Jominy end-quench 
test (Figure 11.15), from which hardenability curves are generated.Heat Treatment 
of Steels
References  •   403
• Some alloys are amenable to precipitation hardening —that is, to strengthening by the 
formation of very small particles of a second, or precipitate, phase.
• Control of particle size and, subsequently, strength is accomplished by two heat 
treatments:
In the first, or solution, heat treatment, all solute atoms are dissolved to form a 
single-phase solid solution; quenching to a relatively low temperature preserves 
this state.
During the second, or precipitation, treatment (at constant temperature), pre-
cipitate particles form and grow; strength, hardness, and ductility depend on heat-treating time (and particle size).
• Strength and hardness increase with time to a maximum and then decrease dur-
ing overaging (Figure 11.28). This process is accelerated with rising temperature (Figure 11.32 a).
• The strengthening phenomenon is explained in terms of an increased resistance to 
dislocation motion by lattice strains that are established in the vicinity of these micro-scopically small precipitate particles.Precipitation 
Hardening• A hardenability curve plots hardness versus distance from the quenched end of a 
Jominy specimen. Hardness decreases with distance from the quenched end (Figure 11.16) because the quenching rate decreases with this distance, as does the martensite content. Each steel alloy has its own distinctive hardenability curve.
• The quenching medium also influences the extent to which martensite forms. Of the 
common quenching media, water is the most efficient, followed by aqueous polymers, oil, and air, in that order.

WHY STUDY Structures and Properties of Ceramics?
Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Sketch/describe unit cells for sodium chloride, ce-
sium chloride, zinc blende, diamond cubic, fluorite, 
and perovskite crystal structures. Do likewise for the atomic structures of graphite and a silica glass.
2.  Given the chemical formula for a ceramic

5.  Compute the flexural strength of ceramic rod 
specimens that have been bent to fracture in three-point loading.
6.  On the basis of slip considerations, explain 
why crystalline ceramic materials are normally brittle.
Ceramic materials were discussed briefly in Chapter 1, which noted that they are inorganic 
and nonmetallic materials. Most ceramics are compounds between metallic and nonme-tallic elements for which the interatomic bonds are either totally ionic, or predominantly ionic but having some covalent character. The term ceramic comes from the Greek word keramikos, which means “burnt stuff,” indicating that desirable properties of these materi-als are normally achieved through a high-temperature heat treatment process called firing.
Up until the past 60 or so years, the most important materials in this class were termed 
the “traditional ceramics,” those for which the primary raw material is clay; products con-sidered to be traditional ceramics are china, porcelain, bricks, tiles, and, in addition, glasses and high-temperature ceramics. Of late, significant progress has been made in understand-ing the fundamental character of these materials and of the phenomena that occur in them that are responsible for their unique properties. Consequently, a new generation of these materials has evolved, and the term ceramic has taken on a much broader meaning. To one degree or another, these new materials have a rather dramatic effect on our lives; electronic, computer, communication, aerospace, and a host of other industries rely on their use.
This chapter discusses the types of crystal structures and atomic point defects that are found 
in ceramic materials and, in addition, some of their mechanical characteristics. Applications and fabrication techniques for this class of materials are treated in the next chapter.12.1 INTRODUCTION
Ceramic Structures
Because ceramics are composed of at least two elements, and often more, their crystal structures are generally more complex than those for metals. The atomic bonding in these materials ranges from purely ionic to totally covalent; many ceramics exhibit a combination of these two bonding types, the degree of ionic character being dependent Some of the properties of ceramics may be explained by 
their structures. For example: (a) The optical transpar-ency of inorganic glass materials is due, in part, to their noncrystallinity; (b) the hydroplasticity of clays (i.e., development of plasticity upon the addition of water) is related to interactions between water molecules and the clay structures (Sections 12.3 and 13.12 and Figure 12.14); and (c) the permanent magnetic and ferroelec-
tric behaviors of some ceramic materials are explained by their crystal structures (Sections 20.5 and 18.24).

on the electronegativities of the atoms. Table 12.1 presents the percent ionic character 
for several common ceramic materials; these values were determined using Equation 2.16 and the electronegativities in Figure 2.9.Table 12.1

Figure 12.1  Stable and unstable 
cation–anion coordination 
configurations. Red circles represent anions; blue circles denote cations.
Stable Stable UnstableFor those ceramic materials for which the atomic bonding is predominantly ionic, the 
crystal structures may be thought of as being composed of electrically charged ions in-stead of atoms. The metallic ions, or cations,  are positively charged because they have 
given up their valence electrons to the nonmetallic ions, or anions,  which are negatively 
charged. Two characteristics of the component ions in crystalline ceramic materials influ-ence the crystal structure: the magnitude of the electrical charge on each of the compo-nent ions, and the relative sizes of the cations and anions. With regard to the first char-acteristic, the crystal must be electrically neutral; that is, all the cation positive charges must be balanced by an equal number of anion negative charges. The chemical formula of a compound indicates the ratio of cations to anions, or the composition that achieves this charge balance. For example, in calcium fluoride, each calcium ion has a +2 charge 
(Ca
2+), and associated with each fluorine ion is a single negative charge (F−). Thus, there 
must be twice as many F− as Ca2+ ions, which is reflected in the chemical formula CaF2.
The second criterion involves the sizes or ionic radii of the cations and anions, rC 
and rA, respectively. Because the metallic elements give up electrons when ionized, 
cations are ordinarily smaller than anions, and, consequently, the ratio rC/rA is less than 
unity. Each cation prefers to have as many nearest-neighbor anions as possible. The anions also desire a maximum number of cation nearest neighbors.
Stable ceramic crystal structures form when those anions surrounding a cation are 
all in contact with that cation, as illustrated in Figure 12.1. The coordination number (i.e., number of anion nearest neighbors for a cation) is related to the cation–anion radius ratio. For a specific coordination number, there is a critical or minimum r
C/rA 
ratio for which this cation–anion contact is established (Figure 12.1); this ratio may be determined from pure geometrical considerations (see Example Problem 12.1).
The coordination numbers and nearest-neighbor geometries for various r
C/rA ratios 
are presented in Table 12.2. For rC/rA ratios less than 0.155, the very small cation is bonded cation

to two anions in a linear manner. If rC/rA has a value between 0.155 and 0.225, the coordina-
tion number for the cation is 3. This means each cation is surrounded by three anions in the 
form of a planar equilateral triangle, with the cation located in the center. The coordina-tion number is 4 for r
C/rA between 0.225 and 0.414; the cation is located at the center of a 
tetrahedron, with anions at each of the four corners. For rC/rA between 0.414 and 0.732, the 
cation may be thought of as being situated at the center of an octahedron surrounded by six anions, one at each corner, as also shown in the table. The coordination number is 8 for r
C/rA between 0.732 and 1.0, with anions at all corners of a cube and a cation positioned at 
the center. For a radius ratio greater than unity, the coordination number is 12. The most common coordination numbers for ceramic materials are 4, 6, and 8. Table 12.3 gives the ionic radii for several anions and cations that are common in ceramic materials.
The relationships between coordination number and cation–anion radius ratios (as 
noted in Table 12.2) are based on geometrical considerations and assuming “hard-sphere”

ions; therefore, these relationships are only approximate, and there are exceptions. For 
example, some ceramic compounds with rC/rA ratios greater than 0.414 in which the bond-
ing is highly covalent (and directional) have a coordination number of 4 (instead of 6).
The size of an ion depends on several factors. One of these is coordination number: 
ionic radius tends to increase as the number of nearest-neighbor ions of opposite charge increases. Ionic radii given in Table 12.3 are for a coordination number of 6. Therefore, the radius is greater for a coordination number of 8 and less when the coordination number is 4.
In addition, the charge on an ion will influence its radius. For example, from Table 
12.3, the radii for Fe
2+ and Fe3+ are 0.077 and 0.069 nm, respectively, which values may 
be contrasted to the radius of an iron atom—0.124 nm. When an electron is removed from an atom or ion, the remaining valence electrons become more tightly bound to the nucleus, which results in a decrease in ionic radius. Conversely, ionic size increases when electrons are added to an atom or ion.Table 12.3

Solution
For this coordination, the small cation is sur-
rounded by three anions to form an equilateral triangle as shown here, triangle ABC; the centers 
of all four ions are coplanar. This boils down to a relatively simple plane trigonometry problem. Consideration of the right triangle APO makes it clear that the side lengths

AX-Type Crystal Structures
Some of the common ceramic materials are those in which there are equal numbers of 
cations and anions. These are often referred to as AX compounds, where A denotes the cation and X the anion. There are several different crystal structures for AX compounds; each is typically named after a common material that assumes the particular structure.
Rock Salt Structure
 Perhaps the most common AX crystal structure is the sodium chloride (NaCl), or 
rock salt, type. The coordination number for both cations and anions is 6, and there-fore the cation–anion radius ratio is between approximately 0.414 and 0.732. A unit cell for this crystal structure (Figure 12.2) is generated from an FCC arrangement of anions with one cation situated at the cube center and one at the center of each of the 12 cube edges. An equivalent crystal structure results from a face-centered arrangement of cations. Thus, the rock salt crystal structure may be thought of as two interpenetrating FCC lattices—one composed of the cations, the other of anions. Some common ceramic materials that form with this crystal structure are NaCl, MgO, MnS, LiF, and FeO.
Cesium Chloride Structure
 Figure 12.3 shows a unit cell for the cesium chloride (CsCl) crystal structure; the co-ordination number is 8 for both ion types. The anions are located at each of the corners of a cube, whereas the cube center is a single cation. Interchange of anions with cations, and vice versa, produces the same crystal structure. This is not a BCC crystal structure 
because ions of two different kinds are involved.
Zinc Blende Structure
 A third AX structure is one in which the coordination number is 4—that is, all ions are tetrahedrally coordinated. This is called the zinc blende, or sphalerite, structure, after 
the mineralogical term for zinc sulfide (ZnS). A unit cell is presented in Figure 12.4; all corner and face positions of the cubic cell are occupied by S atoms, whereas the Zn atoms fill interior tetrahedral positions. An equivalent structure results if Zn and S atom positions are reversed. Thus, each Zn atom is bonded to four S atoms, and vice versa. Most often the atomic bonding is highly covalent in compounds exhibiting this crystal structure (Table 12.1), which include ZnS, ZnTe, and SiC.   : VMSE

AmXp-Type Crystal Structures
If the charges on the cations and anions are not the same, a compound can exist with the 
chemical formula AmXp, where m  and/or p≠1. An example is AX2, for which a common 
crystal structure is found in fluorite (CaF2). The ionic radii ratio rC/rA for CaF2 is about 
0.8, which, according to Table 12.2, gives a coordination number of 8. Calcium ions are positioned at the centers of cubes, with fluorine ions at the corners. The chemical formula shows that there are only half as many Ca
2+ ions as F− ions, and therefore the crystal 
structure is similar to CsCl (Figure 12.3), except that only half the center cube positions are occupied by Ca
2+ ions. One unit cell consists of eight cubes, as indicated in Figure 12.5. 
Other compounds with this crystal structure include ZrO2 (cubic), UO2, PuO2, and ThO2.
AmBnXp-Type Crystal Structures
It is also possible for ceramic compounds to have more than one type of cation; for two types of cations (represented by A and B), their chemical formula may be designated as A
mBnXp. Barium titanate (BaTiO3), having both Ba2+ and Ti4+ cations, falls into this 
classification. This material has a perovskite crystal structure and rather interesting elec-
tromechanical properties to be discussed later. At temperatures above 120 °C (248°F), 
the crystal structure is cubic. A unit cell of this structure is shown in Figure 12.6; Ba2+    : VMSE

ions are situated at all eight corners of the cube and a single Ti4+ is at the cube center, 
with O2− ions located at the center of each of the six faces.
Table 12.4 summarizes the rock salt, cesium chloride, zinc blende, fluorite, and 
perovskite crystal structures in terms of cation–anion ratios and coordination numbers 
and gives examples for each. Of course, many other ceramic crystal structures are possible.
Crystal Structures from the Close Packing of Anions
It may be recalled (Section 3.12) that for metals, close-packed planes of atoms stacked on one another generate both FCC and HCP crystal structures. Similarly, a number of ceramic crystal structures may be considered in terms of close-packed planes of ions, as well as unit cells. Ordinarily, the close-packed planes are composed of the large anions. As these planes are stacked atop each other, small interstitial sites are created between them in which the cations may reside.
These interstitial positions exist in two different types, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. 
Four atoms (three in one plane, and a single one in the adjacent plane) surround one type; this is termed a tetrahedral position, because straight lines drawn from the centers 
of the surrounding spheres form a four-sided tetrahedron. The other site type in Figure 12.7 involves six ion spheres, three in each of the two planes. Because an octahedron is produced by joining these six sphere centers, this site is called an octahedral position. 
Thus, the coordination numbers for cations filling tetrahedral and octahedral positions are 4 and 6, respectively. Furthermore, for each of these anion spheres, one octahedral and two tetrahedral positions exist.
Ceramic crystal structures of this type depend on two factors: (1) the stacking 
of the close-packed anion layers (both FCC and HCP arrangements are possible, which correspond to ABCABC . . . and ABABAB . . . sequences, respectively), and (2) the manner in which the interstitial sites are filled with cations. For example, consider the rock salt crystal structure discussed earlier. The unit cell has cubic symmetry, and each cation (Na
+ ion) has six Cl− ion nearest neighbors, as may be 
verified from Figure 12.2. That is, the Na+ ion at the center has as nearest neigh-
bors the six Cl− ions that reside at the centers of each of the cube faces. The crystal    : VMSE

structure, having cubic symmetry, may be considered in terms of an FCC array 
of close-packed planes of anions, and all planes are of the {111}  type. The cations 
reside in octahedral positions because they have as nearest neighbors six anions. Furthermore, all octahedral positions are filled, because there is a single octahedral site per anion, and the ratio of anions to cations is 1:1. For this crystal structure, the relationship between the unit cell and close-packed anion plane stacking schemes is illustrated in Figure 12.8.
Other, but not all, ceramic crystal structures may be treated in a similar manner; 
included are the zinc blende and perovskite structures. The spinel structure is one of the A
mBnXp types, which is found for magnesium aluminate or spinel (MgAl2O4). 
With this structure, the O2− ions form an FCC lattice, whereas Mg2+ ions fill tetrahe-
dral sites and Al3+ ions reside in octahedral positions. Magnetic ceramics, or ferrites, 
have a crystal structure that is a slight variant of this spinel structure, and the magnetic characteristics are affected by the occupancy of tetrahedral and octahedral positions (see Section 20.5).   : VMSEFigure 12.7  The stacking of one plane of close-packed (orange) spheres (anions) on top of another (blue

Ceramic Density Computations
It is possible to compute the theoretical density of a crystalline ceramic material from 
unit cell data in a manner similar to that described in Section 3.5 for metals. In this case the density 𝜌 may be determined using a modified form of Equation 3.8, as follows:
 
𝜌=n′(ΣAC+ΣAA)
VCNA (12.1)
where
nʹ = the number of formula units within the unit cell1
∑AC = the sum of the atomic weights of all cations in the formula unit
∑AA = the sum of the atomic weights of all anions in the formula unit

mula unit consists of one barium ion, one titanium ion, and three oxygen ions.EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.2
Ceramic Crystal Structure Prediction
On the basis of ionic radii (Table 12.3), what crystal structure do you predict for FeO?
Solution
First, note that FeO is an AX-type compound. Next, determine the cation–anion radius ratio, 
which from Table 12.3 is
rFe2+
rO2−=0.077 nm
0.140 nm=0.550
This value lies between 0.414 and 0.732, and, therefore, from Table 12.2 the coordination num-ber for the Fe
2+ ion is 6; this is also the coordination number of O2− because there are equal 
numbers of cations and anions. The predicted crystal structure is rock salt, which is the AX crystal structure having a coordination number of 6, as given in Table 12.4.

respectively.

Theoretical Density Calculation for Sodium Chloride
On the basis of the crystal structure, compute the theoretical density for sodium chloride. How 
does this compare with its measured density?
Solution
The theoretical density may be determined using Equation 12.1, where nʹ, the number of NaCl 
units per unit cell, is 4 because both sodium and chloride ions form FCC lattices. Furthermore,
ΣAC=ANa=22.99 g∕ mol
ΣAA=ACl=35.45 g∕ mol

length. For the face of the cubic unit cell shown in the accompany-
ing figure,

12.3 SILICATE CERAMICS
Silicates are materials composed primarily of silicon and oxygen, the two most abundant 
elements in Earth’s crust; consequently, the bulk of soils, rocks, clays, and sand come under the silicate classification. Rather than characterizing the crystal structures of these materials in terms of unit cells, it is more convenient to use various arrangements of an 
SiO
4−
4 tetrahedron (Figure 12.9). Each atom of silicon is bonded to four oxygen atoms, 
–

tetrahedron.
416  •   Chapter 12  /  Structures and Properties of Ceramics
which are situated at the corners of the tetrahedron; the silicon atom is positioned at the 
center. Because this is the basic unit of the silicates, it is often treated as a negatively charged entity.
Often the silicates are not considered to be ionic because there is a significant 
covalent character to the interatomic Si–O bonds (Table 12.1), which are directional and relatively strong. Regardless of the character of the Si–O bond, there is a formal charge of −4 associated with every SiO
4−
4 tetrahedron because each of the four oxygen 
atoms requires an extra electron to achieve a stable electronic structure. Various silicate structures arise from the different ways in which the SiO
4−
4 units can be combined into 
one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrangements.
Silica
Chemically, the most simple silicate material is silicon dioxide, or silica (SiO2). Structurally, 
it is a three-dimensional network that is generated when the corner oxygen atoms in each tetrahedron are shared by adjacent tetrahedra. Thus, the material is electrically neutral, and all atoms have stable electronic structures. Under these circumstances the ratio of Si to O atoms is 1:2, as indicated by the chemical formula.
If these tetrahedra are arrayed in a regular and ordered manner, a crystalline struc-
ture is formed. There are three primary polymorphic crystalline forms of silica: quartz, cristobalite (Figure 12.10), and tridymite. Their structures are relatively complicated and comparatively open—that is, the atoms are not closely packed together. As a conse-quence, these crystalline silicas have relatively low densities; for example, at room tem-perature, quartz has a density of only 2.65 g/cm
3. The strength of the Si–O interatomic 
bonds is reflected in a relatively high melting temperature, 1710 °C (3110°F).
Silica Glasses
Silica can also be made to exist as a noncrystalline solid or glass having a high degree of atomic randomness, which is characteristic of the liquid; such a material is called fused 
silica, or vitreous silica. As with crystalline silica, the SiO
4−
4 tetrahedron is the basic 
unit; beyond this structure, considerable disorder exists. The structures for crystalline and noncrystalline silica are compared schematically in Figure 3.24. Other oxides (e.g., B
2O3, GeO2) may also form glassy structures (and polyhedral oxide structures similar to 
that shown in Figure 12.9); these materials, as well as SiO2, are termed network formers.
The common inorganic glasses that are used for containers, windows, and so on 
are silica glasses to which have been added other oxides such as CaO and Na2O. These 
oxides do not form polyhedral networks. Rather, their cations are incorporated within and modify the SiO

4 network; for this reason, these oxide additives are termed network 
modifiers. For example, Figure 12.11 is a schematic representation of the structure of a sodium–silicate glass. Still other oxides, such as TiO
2 and Al2O3 although not network 
formers, substitute for silicon and become part of and stabilize the network; these are called intermediates. From a practical perspective, the addition of these modifiers and 
intermediates lowers the melting point and viscosity of a glass and makes it easier to form at lower temperatures (Section 13.11).
The Silicates
For the various silicate minerals, one, two, or three of the corner oxygen atoms of the 
SiO4−
4 tetrahedra are shared by other tetrahedra to form some rather complex struc-
tures. Some of these, represented in Figure 12.12, have formulas SiO4−
4, Si2O6−
7, Si3O6−
9 
and so on; single-chain structures are also possible, as in Figure 12.12 e. Positively 
charged cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ serve two roles: First, they compensate 
the negative charges from the SiO4−
4 units so that charge neutrality is achieved; second, 
these cations ionically bond the SiO4−
4 tetrahedra together.
12.3 Silicate Ceramics  •   417
Simple Silicates
 Of these silicates, the most structurally simple ones involve isolated tetrahedra 
(Figure 12.12a ). For example, forsterite (Mg2SiO4) has the equivalent of two Mg2+ 
ions associated with each tetrahedron in such a way that every Mg2+ ion has six oxy-
gen nearest neighbors.
The Si2O6−
7 ion is formed when two tetrahedra share a common oxygen atom 
(Figure 12.12b). Akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7) is a mineral having the equivalent of two 
Ca2+ ions and one Mg2+ ion bonded to each Si2O6−
7 unit.Figure 12.10  The arrangement

Layered Silicates
 A two-dimensional sheet or layered structure can also be produced by the shar-
ing of three oxygen ions in each of the tetrahedra (Figure 12.13); for this structure, the repeating unit formula may be represented by (Si
2O5)2−. The net negative charge 
is associated with the unbonded oxygen atoms projecting out of the plane of the page. Electroneutrality is ordinarily established by a second planar sheet structure having an excess of cations, which bond to these unbonded oxygen atoms from the Si
2O5 sheet. 
Such materials are called the sheet or layered silicates, and their basic structure is char-acteristic of the clays and other minerals.
One of the most common clay minerals, kaolinite, has a relatively simple two-layer 
silicate sheet structure. Kaolinite clay has the formula Al
2(Si2O5)(OH)4 in which the 
silica tetrahedral layer, represented by (Si2O5)2−, is made electrically neutral by an ad-
jacent Al2(OH)2+
4 layer. A single sheet of this structure is shown in Figure 12.14, which 
is exploded in the vertical direction to provide a better perspective on the ion positions; the two distinct layers are indicated in the figure. The midplane of anions consists of O
2− ions from the (Si2O5)2− layer, as well as OH− ions that are a part of the Al2(OH)2+
4 
layer. Whereas the bonding within this two-layered sheet is strong and intermediate ionic-covalent, adjacent sheets are only loosely bound to one another by weak van der Waals forces.
A crystal of kaolinite is made of a series of these double layers or sheets stacked 
parallel to each other to form small flat plates that are typically less than 1 μm in diam-
eter and nearly hexagonal. Figure 12.15 is an electron micrograph of kaolinite crystals at a high magnification, showing the hexagonal crystal plates, some of which are piled one on top of the other.Si4+O2–

12.4 Carbon  •   419
These silicate sheet structures are not confined to the clays; other minerals also in 
this group are talc [Mg3(Si2O5)2(OH)2] and the micas [e.g., muscovite, KAl3Si3O10(OH)2], 
which are important ceramic raw materials. As might be deduced from the chemical for-
mulas, the structures for some silicates are among the most complex of all the inorganic materials.
12.4 CARBON
Although not one of the most frequently occurring elements found on Earth, carbon affects our lives in diverse and interesting ways. It exists in the elemental state in nature, and solid carbon has been used by all civilizations since prehistoric times. In today’s world, the unique properties (and property combinations) of the several forms of carbon make it extremely important in many commercial sectors, including some cutting-edge technologies.
Carbon exists in two allotropic forms—diamond and graphite—as well as in the 
amorphous state. The carbon group of materials does not fall within any of the tra-ditional metal, ceramic, or polymer classification schemes. However, we choose to discuss them in this chapter because graphite is sometimes classified as a ceramic. This treatment of the carbons focuses primarily on the structures of diamond and graphite. Discussions on the properties and applications (both current and potential) of diamond and graphite as well as the nanocarbons (i.e., fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graph-ene) are presented in Sections 13.9 and 13.10.
Diamond
Diamond is a metastable carbon polymorph at room temperature and atmospheric pres-sure. Its crystal structure is a variant of the zinc blende structure (Figure 12.4) in which carbon atoms occupy all positions (both Zn and S); the unit cell for diamond is shown in Figure 12.16. Each carbon atom has undergone sp
3 hybridization so that it bonds 
(tetrahedrally) to four other carbons; these are extremely strong covalent bonds dis-cussed in Section 2.6 (and represented in Figure 2.14). The crystal structure of diamond is appropriately called the diamond cubic crystal structure, which is also found for other Group IVA elements in the periodic table [e.g., germanium, silicon, and gray tin below 13°C (55°F)].   : VMSEFigure 12.15  Electron micrograph of kaolin-

Graphite
Another polymorph of carbon, graphite, has a crystal structure (Figure 12.17) distinctly 
different from that of diamond; furthermore, it is a stable polymorph at ambient tem-perature and pressure. For the graphite structure, carbon atoms are located at corners of interlocking regular hexagons that lie in parallel (basal) planes. Within these planes (layers or sheets), sp
2 hybrid orbitals bond each carbon atom to three other adjacent and 
coplanar carbons atoms; these bonds are strong covalent ones.2 This hexagonal configu-
ration assumed by sp2 bonded carbon atoms is represented in Figure 2.18. In addition, 
each atom’s fourth bonding electron is delocalized (i.e., does not belong to a specific 
atom or bond). Rather, its orbital becomes part of a molecular orbital that extends over adjacent atoms and resides between layers. Interlayer bonds are directed perpendicular to these planes (i.e., in the c direction noted in Figure 12.17) and are of the weak van der Waals type.   : VMSE

in Section 13.10.Figure 12.16  A unit cell

12.5 IMPERFECTIONS IN CERAMICS
Atomic Point Defects
Atomic defects involving host atoms may exist in ceramic compounds. As with metals, 
both vacancies and interstitials are possible; however, because ceramic materials contain ions of at least two kinds, defects for each ion type may occur. For example, in NaCl, Na interstitials and vacancies and Cl interstitials and vacancies may exist. It is highly improbable that there would be appreciable concentrations of anion interstitials. The anion is relatively large, and to fit into a small interstitial position, substantial strains on the surrounding ions must be introduced. Anion and cation vacancies and a cation interstitial are represented in Figure 12.18.
The expression defect structure is often used to designate the types and concen-
trations of atomic defects in ceramics. Because the atoms exist as charged ions, when defect structures are considered, conditions of electroneutrality must be maintained. 
Electroneutrality is the state that exists when there are equal numbers of positive and 
defect structure

negative charges from the ions. As a consequence, defects in ceramics do not occur 
alone. One such type of defect involves a cation–vacancy and a cation–interstitial pair. This is called a Frenkel defect (Figure 12.19). It might be thought of as being formed 
by a cation leaving its normal position and moving into an interstitial site. There is no 
change in charge because the cation maintains the same positive charge as an interstitial.
Another type of defect found in AX materials is a cation vacancy–anion vacancy 
pair known as a Schottky defect, also schematically diagrammed in Figure 12.19. This 
defect might be thought of as being created by removing one cation and one anion from the interior of the crystal and then placing them both at an external surface. Because the magnitude of the positive charge on the cation is equal to the magnitude of the negative charge on the anion, and because for every anion vacancy there exists a cation vacancy, the charge neutrality of the crystal is maintained.
The ratio of cations to anions is not altered by the formation of either a Frenkel or a 
Schottky defect. If no other defects are present, the material is said to be stoichiometric. 
Stoichiometry may be defined as a state for ionic compounds wherein there is the exact 
ratio of cations to anions as predicted by the chemical formula. For example, NaCl is stoichiometric if the ratio of Na
+ ions to Cl− ions is exactly 1:1. A ceramic compound is 
nonstoichiometric if there is any deviation from this exact ratio.Frenkel defect

Schottky defect
Frenkel defect
422  •   Chapter 12  /  Structures and Properties of Ceramics
The equilibrium numbers of both Frenkel and Schottky defects increase with 
and depend on temperature in a manner similar to the number of vacancies in metals 
(Equation 4.1). For Frenkel defects, the number of cation–vacancy/cation–interstitial defect pairs (N
fr) depends on temperature according to the following expression:
 Nfr=N exp(− Qfr
2kT) (12.2)
Here, Qfr is the energy required for the formation of each Frenkel defect, and N is the 
total number of lattice sites. (As in previous discussions, k and T represent Boltzmann’s 
constant and the absolute temperature, respectively.) The factor 2 is present in the denominator of the exponential because two defects (a missing cation and an interstitial cation) are associated with each Frenkel defect.
Similarly, for Schottky defects, in an AX-type compound, the equilibrium number 
(N
s) is a function of temperature as
 Ns=N exp(− Qs
2kT) (12.3)
where Qs represents the Schottky defect energy of formation.Nonstoichiometry may occur for some ceramic materials in which two valence 
(or ionic) states exist for one of the ion types. Iron oxide (wüstite, FeO) is one such material because the iron can be present in both Fe
2+ and Fe3+ states; the number of 
each of these ion types depends on temperature and the ambient oxygen pressure. The formation of an Fe
3+ ion disrupts the electroneutrality of the crystal by introducing an 
excess +1 charge, which must be offset by some type of defect. This may be accom-
plished by the formation of one Fe2+ vacancy (or the removal of two positive charges) 
for every two Fe3+ ions that are formed (Figure 12.20). The crystal is no longer stoi-
chiometric because there is one more O ion than Fe ion; however, the crystal remains electrically neutral. This phenomenon is fairly common in iron oxide, and, in fact, its chemical formula is often written as Fe
1–xO (where x  is some small and variable frac-
tion substantially less than unity) to indicate a condition of nonstoichiometry with a deficiency of Fe.Fe2+

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.4
Computation of the Number of Schottky Defects in KCl
Calculate the number of Schottky defects per cubic meter in potassium chloride at 500 °C. The 
energy required to form each Schottky defect is 2.6 eV, whereas the density for KCl (at 500 °C) 
is 1.955 g/cm3.
Solution
To solve this problem it is necessary to use Equation 12.3. However, we must first compute the 
value of N (the number of lattice sites per cubic meter); this is possible using a modified form of Equation 4.2:
 N=N
A𝜌
AK+ACl (12.4)
where NA is Avogadro’s number (6.022 ×1023 atoms/mol), 𝜌 is the density, and AK and ACl 
are the atomic weights for potassium and chlorine (i.e., 39.10 and 35.45 g/mol), respectively. Therefore,
 N=(6.022 ×10
23 atoms/mol)(1.955 g/cm3)(106 cm3/m3)
39.10 g/mol +35.45 g/mol
 =1.58 ×1028 lattice sites/m3
Now, incorporating this value into Equation 12.3 leads to the following value for Ns:
 Ns=N exp(− Qs
2kT)
 =(1.58 ×1028 lattice sites/m3) exp[− 2.6 eV
(2)(8.62 ×10−5 eV/K)(500 +273 K) ]
 =5.31 ×1019 defects/m3
Impurities in Ceramics
Impurity atoms can form solid solutions in ceramic materials much as they do in 
metals. Solid solutions of both substitutional and interstitial types are possible. For an interstitial, the ionic radius of the impurity must be relatively small in comparison to the anion. Because there are both anions and cations, a substitutional impurity substitutes for the host ion to which it is most similar in an electrical sense: If the impurity atom normally forms a cation in a ceramic material, it most probably will substitute for a host cation. For example, in sodium chloride, impurity Ca
2+ and 
O2− ions would most likely substitute for Na+ and Cl− ions, respectively. Schematic 
representations for cation and anion substitutional as well as interstitial impurities are shown in Figure 12.21. To achieve any appreciable solid solubility of substitut-ing impurity atoms, the ionic size and charge must be very nearly the same as those of one of the host ions. For an impurity ion having a charge different from that of the host ion for which it substitutes, the crystal must compensate for this difference in charge so that electroneutrality is maintained with the solid. One way this is ac-complished is by the formation of lattice defects—vacancies or interstitials of both ion types, as discussed previously.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.5
Determination of Possible Point Defect Types in NaCl Due to the Presence 
of Ca2+ Ions
If electroneutrality is to be preserved, what point defects are possible in NaCl when a Ca2+ 
substitutes for an Na+ ion? How many of these defects exist for every Ca2+ ion?
Solution
Replacement of an Na+ by a Ca2+ ion introduces one extra positive charge. Electroneutrality is 
maintained when either a single positive charge is eliminated or another single negative charge 
is added. Removal of a positive charge is accomplished by the formation of one Na+ vacancy. 
Alternatively, a Cl− interstitial supplies an additional negative charge, negating the effect of 
each Ca2+ ion. However, as mentioned earlier, the formation of this defect is highly unlikely.
12.6 DIFFUSION IN IONIC MATERIALS
For ionic compounds, the phenomenon of diffusion is more complicated than for met-als inasmuch as it is necessary to consider the diffusive motion of two types of ions that have opposite charges. Diffusion in these materials usually occurs by a vacancy mech-anism (Figure 5.2a ). As noted in Section 12.5, in order to maintain charge neutrality in 
an ionic material, the following may be said about vacancies: (1) ion vacancies occur in pairs [as with Schottky defects (Figure 12.19)], (2) they form in nonstoichiometric compounds (Figure 12.20), and (3) they are created by substitutional impurity ions having different charge states than the host ions (Example Problem 12.5). In any event, associated with the diffusive motion of a single ion is a transference of electrical charge. In order to maintain localized charge neutrality in the vicinity of this moving Concept Check 12.3 What point defects are possible for MgO as an impurity in Al2O3? 
How many Mg2+ ions must be added to form each of these defects?

12.7 Ceramic Phase Diagrams  •   425
ion, another species having an equal and opposite charge must accompany the ion’s 
diffusive motion. Possible charged species include another vacancy, an impurity atom, or an electronic carrier [i.e., a free electron or hole (Section 18.6)]. It follows that the rate of diffusion of these electrically charged couples is limited by the diffusion rate of the slowest-moving species.
When an external electric field is applied across an ionic solid, the electrically 
charged ions migrate (i.e., diffuse) in response to forces that are brought to bear on them. As we discuss in Section 18.16, this ionic motion gives rise to an electric cur-rent. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity is a function of the diffusion coefficient (Equation 18.23). Consequently, much of the diffusion data for ionic solids come from electrical conductivity measurements.
12.7 CERAMIC PHASE DIAGRAMS
Phase diagrams have been experimentally determined for many ceramic systems. For binary or two-component phase diagrams, it is frequently the case that the two compo-nents are compounds that share a common element, often oxygen. These diagrams may have configurations similar to those for metal–metal systems, and they are interpreted in the same way. For a review of the interpretation of phase diagrams, the reader is referred to Section 9.8.
The Al2O3–Cr2O3 System
One of the relatively simple ceramic phase diagrams is the one for the aluminum oxide–chromium oxide system, Figure 12.22. This diagram has the same form as the isomor-phous copper–nickel phase diagram (Figure 9.3 a), consisting of single liquid-phase 
and single solid-phase regions separated by a two-phase solid–liquid region having the shape of a blade. The Al
2O3–Cr2O3 solid solution is a substitutional one in which Al3+ 
substitutes for Cr3+ and vice versa. It exists for all compositions below the melting point

of Al2O3 because both aluminum and chromium ions have the same charge as well as 
similar radii (0.053 and 0.062 nm, respectively). In addition, both Al2O3 and Cr2O3 have 
the same crystal structure.
The MgO–Al2O3 System
The phase diagram for the magnesium oxide–aluminum oxide system (Figure 12.23) is 
similar in many respects to the lead–magnesium diagram (Figure 9.20). There exists an intermediate phase, or better, a compound, called spinel, which has the chemical for-
mula MgAl
2O4 (or MgO–Al2O3). Even though spinel is a distinct compound [of compo-
sition 50 mol% Al2O3–50 mol% MgO (72 wt% Al2O3–28 wt% MgO)], it is represented 
on the phase diagram as a single-phase field rather than as a vertical line, as for Mg2Pb 
(Figure 9.20)—that is, there is a range of compositions over which spinel is a stable com-pound. Thus, spinel is nonstoichiometric for other than the 50 mol% Al
2O3–50 mol% 
MgO composition. Furthermore, there is limited solubility of Al2O3 in MgO below 
about 1400°C (2550°F) at the left-hand extreme of Figure 12.23, which is due primarily to the differences in charge and radii of the Mg
2+ and Al3+ ions (0.072 vs. 0.053 nm). 
For the same reasons, MgO is virtually insoluble in Al2O3, as evidenced by a lack of a 
terminal solid solution on the right-hand side of the phase diagram. Also, two eutectics are found, one on either side of the spinel phase field, and stoichiometric spinel melts congruently at about 2100°C (3800°F).
The ZrO2–CaO System
Another important binary ceramic system is that for zirconium oxide (zirconia) and calcium oxide (calcia); a portion of this phase diagram is shown in Figure 12.24. The horizontal axis extends to only about 31 wt% CaO (50 mol% CaO), at which composi-tion the compound CaZrO
3 forms. It is worth noting that one eutectic (2250° C and 
23 wt% CaO) and two eutectoid (1000°C and 2.5 wt% CaO, and 850°C and 7.5 wt% CaO) reactions are found for this system.Figure 12.23  The

12.7 Ceramic Phase Diagrams  •   427
It may also be observed from Figure 12.24 that ZrO2 phases having three different 
crystal structures exist in this system—tetragonal, monoclinic, and cubic. Pure ZrO2 
experiences a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation at about 1150°C (2102°F). 
A relatively large volume change accompanies this transformation, resulting in the formation of cracks that render a ceramic ware useless. This problem is overcome by “stabilizing” the zirconia by adding between about 3 and 7 wt% CaO. Over this compo-sition range and at temperatures above about 1000 °C, both cubic and tetragonal phases 
are present. Upon cooling to room temperature under normal cooling conditions, the monoclinic and CaZr
4O9 phases do not form (as predicted from the phase diagram); 
consequently, the cubic and tetragonal phases are retained, and crack formation is cir-cumvented. A zirconia material having a calcia content within the range cited is termed a partially stabilized zirconia, or PSZ. Yttrium oxide (Y
2O3) and magnesium oxide are 
also used as stabilizing agents. Furthermore, for higher stabilizer contents, only the cubic phase may be retained at room temperature; such a material is fully stabilized.
The SiO2–Al2O3 System
Commercially, the silica–alumina system is an important one because the principal constituents of many ceramic refractories are these two materials. Figure 12.25 shows the SiO
2–Al2O3 phase diagram. The polymorphic form of silica that is stable at these Figure 12.24  A portion

Prior to the Bronze Age, human tools and vessels were primarily made of stone (a 
ceramic). Between 3000 and 4000 years ago, metals came into widespread use because of their toughness that is derived from their ductility. For most of that history, ceramic materials were somewhat limited in applicability because of their brittle nature. Their principal drawback has been a disposition to catastrophic fracture in a brittle manner with very little energy absorption.

12.8 Brittle Fracture of Ceramics  •   429
mult iphase ceramics with useful toughness are being developed (often mimicking 
naturally occurring composite ceramics such as seashells), the bulk of ceramic materi-
als currently in use are brittle.
12.8 BRITTLE FRACTURE OF CERAMICS
At room temperature, both crystalline and noncrystalline ceramics almost always frac-ture before any plastic deformation can occur in response to an applied tensile load. The topics of brittle fracture and fracture mechanics, as discussed previously in Sections 8.4 and 8.5, also relate to the fracture of ceramic materials; they will be reviewed briefly in this context.
The brittle fracture process consists of the formation and propagation of cracks 
through the cross section of material in a direction perpendicular to the applied load. Crack growth in crystalline ceramics may be either transgranular (i.e., through the grains) or intergranular (i.e., along grain boundaries); for transgranular fracture, cracks propa-gate along specific crystallographic (or cleavage) planes, planes of high atomic density.
The measured fracture strengths of most ceramic materials are substantially lower 
than predicted by theory from interatomic bonding forces. This may be explained by very small and omnipresent flaws in the material that serve as stress raisers—points at which the magnitude of an applied tensile stress is amplified and no mechanism such as plastic deformation exists to slow down or divert such cracks. For single-phase (i.e., monolithic) ceramics, the degree of stress amplification depends on crack length and tip radius of curvature according to Equation 8.1, being greatest for long and pointed flaws. These stress raisers may be minute surface or interior cracks (microcracks), inter-nal pores, inclusions, and grain corners, which are virtually impossible to eliminate or control. For example, even moisture and contaminants in the atmosphere can introduce surface cracks in freshly drawn glass fibers, thus deleteriously affecting the strength. A stress concentration at a flaw tip can cause a crack to form that may propagate until the eventual failure.
The measure of a ceramic material’s ability to resist fracture when a crack is present 
is specified in terms of fracture toughness. The plane strain fracture toughness K
Ic, as 
discussed in Section 8.5, is defined according to the expression
 KIc=Y𝜎√𝜋a (12.5)
where Y is a dimensionless parameter or function that depends on both specimen 
and crack geometries, 𝜎 is the applied stress, and a is the length of a surface crack or 
half of the length of an internal crack. Crack propagation will not occur as long as the right-hand side of Equation 12.5 is less than the plane strain fracture toughness of the material. Plane strain fracture toughness values for ceramic materials are smaller than for metals; typically, they are below 10 MPa
√m (9 ksi √in.). Values of KIc for several 
ceramic materials are included in Table 8.1 and Table B.5 of Appendix B.
Under some circumstances, fracture of ceramic materials will occur by the slow 
propagation of cracks, when stresses are static in nature, and the right-hand side of Equation 12.5 is less than K
Ic. This phenomenon is called static fatigue, or delayed 
fracture; use of the term fatigue is somewhat misleading because fracture may occur in the absence of cyclic stresses (metal fatigue was discussed in Chapter 8). This type of fracture is especially sensitive to environmental conditions, specifically when moisture is present in the atmosphere. With regard to mechanism, a stress–corrosion process probably occurs at the crack tips. That is, the combination of an applied tensile stress and atmospheric moisture at crack tips causes ionic bonds to rupture; this leads to a sharpening and lengthening of the cracks until, ultimately, one crack grows to a size capable of rapid propagation according to Equation 8.3. Furthermore, the duration of Plane strain fracture

430  •   Chapter 12  /  Structures and Properties of Ceramics
stress application preceding fracture decreases with increasing stress. Consequently, 
when specifying the static fatigue strength, the time of stress application should also be stipulated. Silicate glasses are especially susceptible to this type of fracture; it has also been observed in other ceramic materials, including porcelain, Portland cement, high-alumina ceramics, barium titanate, and silicon nitride.
There is usually considerable variation and scatter in the fracture strength for many 
specimens of a specific brittle ceramic material. A distribution of fracture strengths for a silicon nitride material is shown in Figure 12.26. This phenomenon may be explained by the dependence of fracture strength on the probability of the existence of a flaw that is capable of initiating a crack. This probability varies from specimen to specimen of the same material and depends on fabrication technique and any subsequent treatment. Specimen size or volume also influences fracture strength; the larger the specimen, the greater this flaw existence probability, and the lower the fracture strength.
For compressive stresses, there is no stress amplification associated with any exis-
tent flaws. For this reason, brittle ceramics display much higher strengths in compres-sion than in tension (on the order of a factor of 10), and they are generally used when load conditions are compressive. Also, the fracture strength of a brittle ceramic may be enhanced dramatically by imposing residual compressive stresses at its surface. One way this may be accomplished is by thermal tempering (see Section 13.11).
Statistical theories have been developed that in conjunction with experimental data 
are used to determine the risk of fracture for a given material; a discussion of these is beyond the scope of the present treatment. However, because of the dispersion in the measured fracture strengths of brittle ceramic materials, average values and factors of safety as discussed in Sections 6.11 and 6.12 typically are not used for design purposes.
Fractography of Ceramics
It is sometimes necessary to acquire information regarding the cause of a ceramic frac-ture so that measures may be taken to reduce the likelihood of future incidents. A fail-ure analysis normally focuses on determination of the location, type, and source of the Figure 12.26  The frequency distribution of

crack-initiating flaw. A fractographic study (Section 8.3) is normally a part of such an 
analysis, which involves examining the path of crack propagation, as well as microscopic features of the fracture surface. It is often possible to conduct an investigation of this type using simple and inexpensive equipment—for example, a magnifying glass and/or a low-power stereo binocular optical microscope in conjunction with a light source. When higher magnifications are required, the scanning electron microscope is used.
After nucleation and during propagation, a crack accelerates until a critical (or ter-
minal) velocity is achieved; for glass, this critical value is approximately one-half of the speed of sound. Upon reaching this critical velocity, a crack may branch (or bifurcate), a process that may be successively repeated until a family of cracks is produced. Typical crack configurations for four common loading schemes are shown in Figure 12.27. The site of nucleation can often be traced back to the point where a set of cracks converges. Furthermore, the rate of crack acceleration increases with increasing stress level; corre-spondingly, the degree of branching also increases with rising stress. For example, from experience we know that when a large rock strikes (and probably breaks) a window, more crack branching results [i.e., more and smaller cracks form (or more broken frag-ments are produced)] than for a small pebble impact.
During propagation, a crack interacts with the microstructure of the material, the 
stress, and with elastic waves that are generated; these interactions produce distinc-tive features on the fracture surface. Furthermore, these features provide important information on where the crack initiated and the source of the crack-producing defect. In addition, measurement of the approximate fracture-producing stress may be useful; stress magnitude is indicative of whether the ceramic piece was excessively weak or the in-service stress was greater than anticipated.
Several microscopic features normally found on the crack surfaces of failed ceramic 
pieces are shown in the schematic diagram of Figure 12.28 and the photomicrograph in Figure 12.29. The crack surface that formed during the initial acceleration stage of propa-gation is flat and smooth and is appropriately termed the mirror  region (Figure 12.28). 
For glass fractures, this mirror region is extremely flat and highly reflective; for polycrys-talline ceramics, the flat mirror surfaces are rougher and have a granular texture. The outer perimeter of the mirror region is roughly circular, with the crack origin at its center.Figure 12.27  For brittle ceramic materials, schematic

Upon reaching its critical velocity, the crack begins to branch—that is, the crack 
surface changes propagation direction. At this time there is a roughening of the crack 
interface on a microscopic scale and the formation of two more surface features— mist 
and hackle; these are also noted in Figures 12.28 and 12.29. The mist is a faint annular 
region just outside the mirror; it is often not discernible for polycrystalline ceramic

pieces. Beyond the mist is the hackle, which has an even rougher texture. The hackle is 
composed of a set of striations or lines that radiate away from the crack source in the 
direction of crack propagation; they intersect near the crack initiation site and may be used to pinpoint its location.
Qualitative information regarding the magnitude of the fracture-producing stress 
is available from measurement of the mirror radius ( r
m in Figure 12.28). This radius 
is a function of the acceleration rate of a newly formed crack—that is, the greater this acceleration rate, the sooner the crack reaches its critical velocity, and the smaller the mirror radius. Furthermore, the acceleration rate increases with stress level. Thus, as fracture stress level increases, the mirror radius decreases; experimentally it has been observed that

Here, 𝜎f is the stress level at which fracture occurred.
Elastic (sonic) waves are also generated during a fracture event, and the locus of 
intersections of these waves with a propagating crack front gives rise to another type of 
surface feature known as a Wallner line. Wallner lines are arc shaped, and they provide information regarding stress distributions and directions of crack propagation.
12.9 STRESS–STRAIN BEHAVIOR
Flexural Strength
The stress–strain behavior of brittle ceramics is not usually ascertained by a tensile test as outlined in Section 6.2, for three reasons. First, it is difficult to prepare and test specimens having the required geometry. Second, it is difficult to grip brittle materi-als without fracturing them. Third, ceramics fail after only about 0.1% strain, which necessitates that tensile specimens be perfectly aligned to avoid the presence of bend-ing stresses, which are not easily calculated. Therefore, a more suitable transverse bending test is most frequently used in which a rod specimen having either a circular or rectangular cross section is bent until fracture using a three- or four-point loading technique.
3 The three-point loading scheme is illustrated in Figure 12.30. At the point 
of loading, the top surface of the specimen is placed in a state of compression, whereas the bottom surface is in tension. Stress is computed from the specimen thickness, the bending moment, and the moment of inertia of the cross section; these parameters are noted in Figure 12.30 for rectangular and circular cross sections. The maximum tensile stress (as determined using these stress expressions) exists at the bottom speci-men surface directly below the point of load application. Because the tensile strengths of ceramics are about one-tenth of their compressive strengths, and because fracture occurs on the tensile specimen face, the flexure test is a reasonable substitute for the tensile test.
The stress at fracture using this flexure test is known as the flexural strength,  
modulus of rupture, fracture strength, or bend strength, an important mechanical parameter for brittle ceramics. For a rectangular cross section, the flexural strength

increase in the probability of the existence of a crack-producing flaw and, consequently, 
a decrease in flexural strength. In addition, the magnitude of flexural strength for a spe-cific ceramic material is greater than its fracture strength measured from a tensile test. This phenomenon may be explained by differences in specimen volume that are exposed to tensile stresses: The entirety of a tensile specimen is under tensile stress, whereas only some volume fraction of a flexural specimen is subjected to tensile stresses—those regions in the vicinity of the specimen surface opposite to the point of load application (see Figure 12.30).
Elastic Behavior
The elastic stress–strain behavior for ceramic materials using these flexure tests is similar to the tensile test results for metals: a linear relationship exists between stress and strain. Figure 12.31 compares the stress–strain behavior to fracture for aluminum oxide and glass. Again, the slope in the elastic region is the modulus of elasticity; the range of moduli of elasticity for ceramic materials is between about 70 and 500 GPa (10 × 10
6 and 70 × 106 psi), being slightly higher than for metals. Table 12.5 lists values for 
several ceramic materials. A more comprehensive tabulation is contained in Table B.2 of Appendix B. Also, from Figure 12.31 note that neither material experiences plastic deformation prior to fracture.Figure 12.31  Typical stress–

12.10 MECHANISMS OF PLASTIC DEFORMATION
Although at room temperature most ceramic materials suffer fracture before the onset 
of plastic deformation, a brief exploration into the possible mechanisms is worthwhile. Plastic deformation is different for crystalline and noncrystalline ceramics; each is discussed below.
Crystalline Ceramics
For crystalline ceramics, plastic deformation occurs, as with metals, by the motion of dis-locations (Chapter 7). One reason for the hardness and brittleness of these materials is the difficulty of slip (or dislocation motion). For crystalline ceramic materials for which 
436  •   Chapter 12  /  Structures and Properties of Ceramics
the bonding is predominantly ionic, there are very few slip systems (crystallographic 
planes and directions within those planes) along which dislocations may move. This is a consequence of the electrically charged nature of the ions. For slip in some directions, ions of like charge are brought into close proximity to one another; because of electro-static repulsion, this mode of slip is very restricted, to the extent that plastic deformation in ceramics is rarely measurable at room temperature. By way of contrast, in metals, because all atoms are electrically neutral, considerably more slip systems are operable and, consequently, dislocation motion is much more facile.
However, for ceramics in which the bonding is highly covalent, slip is also difficult, and 
they are brittle for the following reasons: (1) the covalent bonds are relatively strong, (2) there are also limited numbers of slip systems, and (3) dislocation structures are complex.
Noncrystalline Ceramics
Plastic deformation does not occur by dislocation motion for noncrystalline ceramics because there is no regular atomic structure. Rather, these materials deform by viscous 
flow, the same manner in which liquids deform; the rate of deformation is proportional to the applied stress. In response to an applied shear stress, atoms or ions slide past one another by the breaking and re-forming of interatomic bonds. However, there is no prescribed manner or direction in which this occurs, as with dislocations. Viscous flow on a macroscopic scale is demonstrated in Figure 12.32.
The characteristic property for viscous flow, viscosity, is a measure of a noncrystal-
line material’s resistance to deformation. For viscous flow in a liquid that originates from shear stresses imposed by two flat and parallel plates, the viscosity 𝜂 is the ratio of 
the applied shear stress 𝜏 and the change in velocity d 𝜐 with distance dy in a direction 
perpendicular to and away from the plates, or
 𝜂=𝜏
d𝜐/dy=F/A
d𝜐/dy (12.8)
This scheme is represented in Figure 12.32.
The units for viscosity are poise (P) and pascal-seconds (Pa ·s); 1 P = 1 dyne ·s/cm2, 
and 1 Pa ·s = 1 N ·s/m2. Conversion from one system of units to the other is according to
10 P =1 Pa ·s
Liquids have relatively low viscosities; for example, the viscosity of water at room tem-
perature is about 10−3 Pa ·s. However, glasses have extremely large viscosities at ambient 
temperatures, which is accounted for by strong interatomic bonding. As the temperature is raised, the magnitude of the bonding is diminished, the sliding motion or flow of the atoms or ions is facilitated, and subsequently there is an attendant decrease in viscosity. A discus-sion of the temperature dependence of viscosity for glasses is deferred to Section 13.11.viscosity

12.11 Miscellaneous Mechanical Considerations  •   437
12.11 MISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Influence of Porosity
As discussed in Sections 13.12 and 13.13, for some ceramic fabrication techniques, the pre-
cursor material is in the form of a powder. Subsequent to compaction or forming of these powder particles into the desired shape, pores or void spaces exist between the powder particles. During the ensuing heat treatment, much of this porosity will be eliminated; however, often this pore elimination process is incomplete and some residual porosity will remain (Figure 13.24). Any residual porosity will have a deleterious influence on both the elastic properties and strength. For example, for some ceramic materials the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity E  decreases with volume fraction porosity P  according to
 
E=E0(1−1.9P +0.9P2)  (12.9)
where E0 is the modulus of elasticity of the nonporous material. The influence of volume 
fraction porosity on the modulus of elasticity for aluminum oxide is shown in Figure 
12.33; the curve in the figure is according to Equation 12.9.
Porosity is deleterious to the flexural strength for two reasons: (1) pores reduce the 
cross-sectional area across which a load is applied, and (2) they also act as stress concen-trators—for an isolated spherical pore, an applied tensile stress is amplified by a factor of 2. The influence of porosity on strength is rather dramatic; for example, 10 vol% porosity often decreases the flexural strength by 50% from the measured value for the nonporous material. The degree of the influence of pore volume on flexural strength is demon-strated in Figure 12.34, again for aluminum oxide. Experimentally, it has been shown that the flexural strength decreases exponentially with volume fraction porosity ( P) as
 
𝜎fs=𝜎0 exp( −nP)  (12.10)
where 𝜎0 and n are experimental constants.
Hardness
Accurate hardness measurements are difficult to conduct inasmuch as ceramic materi-als are brittle and highly susceptible to cracking when indenters are forced into their surfaces; extensive crack formation leads to inaccurate readings. Spherical indenters (as with Rockwell and Brinell tests) are normally not used for ceramic materials because they produce severe cracking. Rather, hardnesses of this class of materials are mea-sured using Vickers and Knoop techniques that use indenters having pyramidal shapes Dependence of

(Section 6.10, Table 6.5).4 Vickers is widely used for measuring hardnesses of ceramics; 
however, for very brittle ceramic materials, Knoop is often preferred. For both tech-
niques, hardness decreases with increasing load (or indentation size), but ultimately reaches a constant hardness plateau that is independent of load; the value of hardness at this plateau varies from ceramic to ceramic. An ideal hardness test would be designed so as to use a sufficiently large load that lies near this plateau, yet of a magnitude that does not introduce excessive cracking.
Possibly the most desirable mechanical characteristic of ceramics is their hardness; 
the hardest known materials belong to this group. A listing of a number of different ceramic materials according to Vickers hardness is contained in Table 12.6.
5 These ma-
terials are often utilized when an abrasive or grinding action is required (Section 13.6).
Creep
Often, ceramic materials experience creep deformation as a result of exposure to stresses (usually compressive) at elevated temperatures. In general, the time–deformation creep  behavior of ceramics is similar to that of metals (Section 8.12); however, creep occurs at higher temperatures in ceramics. High-temperature compressive creep tests are conducted on ceramic materials to ascertain creep deformation as a function of temperature and stress level.Figure 12.34  The influence of porosity on

Summary  •   439
SUMMARY
• Interatomic bonding in ceramics ranges from purely ionic to totally covalent.
• For predominantly ionic bonding:
Metallic cations are positively charged, whereas nonmetallic ions have negative 
charges.
Crystal structure is determined by (1) the charge magnitude on each ion and (2) 
the radius of each type of ion.
• Many of the simpler crystal structures are described in terms of unit cells:
Rock salt (Figure 12.2)
Cesium chloride (Figure 12.3)Zinc blende (Figure 12.4)Fluorite (Figure 12.5)Perovskite (Figure 12.6)
• Some crystal structures may be generated from the stacking of close-packed planes 
of anions; cations fill interstitial tetrahedral and/or octahedral positions that exist between adjacent planes.
• The theoretical density of a ceramic material may be computed using Equation 12.1.
• For the silicates, structure is more conveniently represented in terms of interconnect-
ing SiO
4−
4 tetrahedra (Figure 12.9). Relatively complex structures may result when 
other cations (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+) and anions (e.g., OH−) are added.
• Silicate ceramics include the following:
Crystalline silica (SiO2) (as cristobalite, Figure 12.10)
Layered silicates (Figures 12.13 and 12.14)
Noncrystalline silica glasses (Figure 12.11)
• Carbon (sometimes also considered a ceramic) may exist in several polymorphic 
forms, to include:
Diamond (Figure 12.16)
Graphite (Figure 12.17)
• With regard to atomic point defects, interstitials and vacancies for each anion and 
cation type are possible (Figure 12.18).
• Inasmuch as electrical charges are associated with atomic point defects in ceramic 
materials, defects sometimes occur in pairs (e.g., Frenkel and Schottky) in order to 
maintain charge neutrality.
• A stoichiometric ceramic is one in which the ratio of cations to anions is exactly the 
same as predicted by the chemical formula.
• Nonstoichiometric materials are possible in cases where one of the ions may exist in 
more than one ionic state (e.g., Fe(1−x)O for Fe2+ and Fe3+).
• Addition of impurity atoms may result in the formation of substitutional or interstitial 
solid solutions. For substitutional, an impurity atom substitutes for that host atom to which it is most similar in an electrical sense.
• Diffusion in ionic materials normally occurs by a vacancy mechanism; localized 
charge neutrality is maintained by the coupled diffusive motion of a charged vacancy and some other charged entity.
• The general characteristics of ceramic phase diagrams are similar to those for metallic 
systems.
• Diagrams for Al
2O3–Cr2O3 (Figure 12.22), MgO–Al2O3 (Figure 12.23), ZrO2–CaO 
(Figure 12.24), and SiO2–Al2O3 (Figure 12.25) systems were discussed.Crystal Structures

• For ceramic materials, microcracks, the presence of which is very difficult to control, 
result in amplification of applied tensile stresses and account for relatively low frac-
ture strengths (flexural strengths).
• Considerable variation in fracture strength for specimens of a specific material re-
sults inasmuch as the size of a crack-initiating flaw varies from specimen to specimen.
• This stress amplification does not occur with compressive loads; consequently, ceram-
ics are stronger in compression.
• Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of a ceramic material may reveal the 
location and source of the crack-producing flaw (Figure 12.29).
• The stress–strain behaviors and fracture strengths of ceramic materials are deter-
mined using transverse bending tests.
• Flexural strengths as measured from three-point transverse bending tests may be 
determined for rectangular and circular cross-sections using, respectively, Equations 12.7a and 12.7b.
• Any plastic deformation of crystalline ceramics is a result of dislocation motion; the 
brittleness of these materials is explained, in part, by the limited number of operable slip systems.
• The mode of plastic deformation for noncrystalline materials is by viscous flow; a 
 material’s resistance to deformation is expressed as viscosity (in units of Pa
·s). At 
room temperature, the viscosities of many noncrystalline ceramics are extremely high.
• Many ceramic bodies contain residual porosity, which is deleterious to both their 
moduli of elasticity and fracture strengths.
Modulus of elasticity depends on and decreases with volume fraction porosity 
according to Equation 12.9.
The diminishment of flexural strength with volume fraction porosity is described 
by Equation 12.10.
• Hardness of ceramic materials is difficult to measure because of their brittleness and 
susceptibility to cracking when indented.
• Microindentation Knoop and Vickers techniques are normally used, which employ 
pyramidal-shaped indenters.
• The hardest known materials are ceramics, which characteristic makes them espe-
cially attractive for use as abrasives (Section 13.6).Brittle Fracture of

  •  443WHY STUDY Applications and Processing of Ceramics?
The preceding discussions of the properties of materials have demonstrated that there 
is a significant disparity between the physical characteristics of metals and  ceramics. Consequently, these materials are used in completely different kinds of applications and, in this regard, tend to complement each other and also the polymers. Most ceramic materials fall into an application–classification scheme that includes the follow ing groups: glasses, structural clay products, whitewares,  refractories, abrasives, 
cements, ceramic biomaterials, carbons, and the newly developed advanced  ceramics. Figure 13.1  presents a taxonomy of these several types; some discussion is devoted to each in this chapter.13.1 INTRODUCTIONLearning Objectives

FibersIt is important for the engineer to realize how the  applications and processing of ceramic materials are influenced by their mechanical and thermal proper-ties, such as hardness, brittleness, and high melting temperatures. For example, ceramic pieces normally cannot be fabricated using conventional metal-forming techniques (Chapter 11). As we discuss in this chapter, they are often formed using powder compaction methods, and subsequently fired (i.e., heat-treated).

The glasses are a familiar group of ceramics; containers, lenses, and fiberglass represent 
typical applications. As already mentioned, they are noncrystalline silicates containing other oxides, notably CaO, Na
2O, K2O, and Al2O3, which influence the glass properties. 
A typical soda–lime glass consists of approximately 70 wt% SiO2, the balance being 
mainly Na2O (soda) and CaO (lime). The compositions of several common glass materials 
are given in Table 13.1. Possibly the two prime assets of these materials are their optical transparency and the relative ease with which they may be fabricated.Types and Applications of Ceramics

Most inorganic glasses can be made to transform from a noncrystalline state into one 
that is crystalline by the proper high-temperature heat treatment. This process is called 
crystallization, and the product is a fine-grained polycrystalline material that is often 
called a glass-ceramic. The formation of these small glass-ceramic grains is, in a sense, a 
phase transformation, which involves nucleation and growth stages. As a  consequence, 
the kinetics (i.e., the rate) of crystallization may be described using the same principles that were applied to phase transformations for metal systems in Section 10.3. For  example, dependence of degree of transformation on temperature and time may be expressed using isothermal transformation and continuous-cooling transformation  diagrams (Sections 10.5 and 10.6). The continuous-cooling transformation diagram for the crystallization of a lunar glass is presented in Figure 13.2; the begin and end trans-formation curves on this plot have the same general shape as those for an iron–carbon alloy of eutectoid composition (Figure 10.26). Also included are two continuous-cooling curves, which are labeled 1 and 2; the cooling rate represented by curve 2 is much greater than that for curve 1. As also noted on this plot, for the continuous-cooling path crystallization

represented by curve 1, crystallization begins at its intersection with the upper curve and 
progresses as time increases and temperature continues to decrease; upon crossing the lower curve, all of the original glass has crystallized. The other cooling curve (curve 2) just misses the nose of the crystallization start curve. It represents a critical cooling rate (for this glass, 100° C/min)—that is, the minimum cooling rate for which the final room-
temperature product is 100% glass; for cooling rates less than this, some glass-ceramic material will form.
A nucleating agent (frequently titanium dioxide) is often added to the glass to 
promote crystallization. The presence of a nucleating agent shifts the begin and end transformation curves to shorter times.
Properties and Applications of Glass-Ceramics
Glass-ceramic materials have been designed to have the following characteristics: rela-tively high mechanical strengths; low coefficients of thermal expansion (to avoid thermal shock); good high-temperature capabilities; good dielectric properties (for  electronic packaging applications); and good biological compatibility. Some glass- ceramics may be made optically transparent; others are opaque. Possibly the most  attractive attribute of this class of materials is the ease with which they may be fabricated; conventional glass-forming techniques may be used conveniently in the mass production of nearly pore-free ware.
Glass-ceramics are manufactured commercially under the trade names of Pyroceram, 
CorningWare, Cercor, and Vision. The most common uses for these materials are as 
ovenware, tableware, oven windows, and range tops—primarily because of their strength and excellent resistance to thermal shock. They also serve as electrical insulators and as 
substrates for printed circuit boards and are used for architectural cladding and for heat exchangers and regenerators. A typical glass-ceramic is also included in Table 13.1; Figure 13.3 is a scanning electron micrograph that shows the microstructure of a glass-ceramic material.Figure 13.2  Continuous-cooling transformation

One of the most widely used ceramic raw materials is clay. This inexpensive ingredient, 
found naturally in great abundance, often is used as mined without any upgrading of quality. Another reason for its popularity lies in the ease with which clay products may be formed; when mixed in the proper proportions, clay and water form a plastic mass that is very amenable to shaping. The formed piece is dried to remove some of the moisture, after which it is fired at an elevated temperature to improve its mechanical strength.
Most clay-based products fall within two broad classifications: the structural clay 
products and whitewares. Structural clay products include building bricks, tiles, and 
sewer pipes—applications in which structural integrity is important. Whiteware ceramics 
become white after high-temperature firing. Included in this group are porcelain, pot-
tery, tableware, china, and plumbing fixtures (sanitary ware). In addition to clay, many of these products also contain nonplastic ingredients, which influence the changes that take place during the drying and firing processes and the characteristics of the finished piece (Section 13.12).structural clay product

firing13.4 CLAY PRODUCTS
Another important class of ceramics used in large tonnages is the refractory ceramics. 
The salient properties of these materials include the capacity to withstand high tem-
peratures without melting or decomposing and the capacity to remain unreactive and inert when exposed to severe environments (e.g., hot and corrosive fluids). In addition, their abilities to provide thermal insulation and support mechanical loads are often im-portant considerations, as well as resistance to thermal shock (fracture caused by rapid temperature changes). Typical applications include linings for furnaces and smelters that refine steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as other metals; furnaces used for glass manufacturing and metallurgical heat treatments; cement kilns; and power generators.
The performance of a refractory ceramic depends on composition and how it is 
processed; most common refractories are made from natural materials—for example refractory oxides such as SiO
2, Al2O3, MgO, CaO, Cr2O3, and ZrO2. On the basis of 
composition, there are two general classifications— clay and nonclay. Table 13.2 notes 
compositions for several commercial refractory materials.refractory ceramic13.5 REFRACTORIES

13.5 Refractories  •   447
Clay Refractories
The clay refractories are subclassified into two categories: fireclay and high-alumina. 
The primary ingredients for the fireclay refractories are high-purity fireclays—alumina and silica mixtures usually containing between 25 and 45 wt% alumina. According to the SiO
2–Al2O3 phase diagram, Figure 12.25, over this composition range the highest 
temperature possible without the formation of a liquid phase is 1587°C (2890°F). Below this temperature, the equilibrium phases present are mullite and silica (cristobalite). During refractory service use, the presence of a small amount of a liquid phase may be allowable without compromising mechanical integrity. Above 1587 °C, the fraction of 
liquid phase present depends on refractory composition. Upgrading the alumina con-tent increases the maximum service temperature, allowing for the formation of a small amount of liquid.
The principal ingredient of the high-alumina refractories is bauxite, a naturally 
occurring mineral that is composed mainly of aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)
3 and 
kaolinite clays; the alumina content varies between 50 and 87.5 wt%. These materials are more robust at high temperatures than the fireclay refractories and may be exposed to more severe environments.
Nonclay Refractories
Raw materials for nonclay refractories are other than clay minerals. Refractories included in this group are silica, periclase, extra-high alumina, zircon, and silicon carbide materials.
The prime ingredient for silica refractories, sometimes termed acid refractories, is 
silica. Silica refractories, well known for their high-temperature load-bearing capacity, are commonly used in the arched roofs of steel- and glass-making furnaces; for these applications, temperatures as high as 1650 °C (3000° F) may be realized. Under these 
conditions, some small portion of the brick actually exists as a liquid. The presence of even small concentrations of alumina has an adverse influence on the performance of these refractories, which may be explained by the silica–alumina phase diagram, Figure 12.25. Because the eutectic composition (7.7 wt% Al
2O3) is very near the silica 
extremity of the phase diagram, even small additions of Al2O3 lower the liquidus tem-
perature significantly, which means that substantial amounts of liquid may be present at temperatures in excess of 1600°C (2910°F). Thus, the alumina content should be held to a minimum, normally to between 0.2 and 1.0 wt%. These refractory materials are also resistant to slags that are rich in silica (called acid slags) and are often used as contain-
ment vessels for them. However, they are readily attacked by slags composed of high proportions of CaO and/or MgO (basic slags), and contact with these oxide materials should be avoided.Table 13.2  Compositions of Seven Ceramic Refractory Materials

Refractories that are rich in periclase (the mineral form of magnesia, MgO), chrome 
ore, and mixtures of these two minerals are termed basic; they may also contain calcium 
and iron compounds. The presence of silica is deleterious to their high-temperature 
performance. Basic refractories are especially resistant to attack by slags containing high concentrations of MgO; these materials find extensive use in the steel-making basic oxygen process (BOP) and electric arc furnaces.
The extra-high alumina refractories have high concentrations of alumina—between 
87.5 and 99+ wt%. These materials can be exposed to temperatures in excess of 1800 °C 
without experiencing the formation of a liquid phase; in addition, they are highly re-sistant to thermal shock. Common applications include use in glass furnaces, ferrous foundries, waste incinerators, and ceramic kiln linings.
Another nonclay refractory is the mineral zircon, or zirconium silicate (ZrO
2∙SiO2); 
composition ranges for these commercial refractory materials are noted in Table 13.2. Zircon’s most outstanding refractory characteristic is its resistance to corrosion by molten glasses at high temperatures. Furthermore, zircon has a relatively high mechanical strength and is resistant to thermal shock and creep. Its most common application is in the construction of glass-melting furnaces.
Silicon carbide (SiC), another refractory ceramic, is produced by a process called 
reaction bonding—reacting sand and coke
1 in an electric furnace at an elevated tempera-
ture (between 2200°C and 2480°C). Sand is the source of silicon and coke the source of carbon. The high-temperature load-bearing characteristics of SiC are excellent, it has an exceptionally high thermal conductivity, and it is very resistant to thermal shock that can result from rapid temperature changes. The primary use of SiC is for kiln furniture to support and separate ceramic pieces that are being fired.
Carbon and graphite are very refractory, but find limited application because they 
are susceptible to oxidation at temperatures in excess of about 800 °C (1470°F).
Refractory ceramics are available in precast shapes, which are easily installed and 
economical to use. Precast products include bricks, crucibles, and furnace structural parts.
The monolithic refractories are typically marketed as powders or plastic masses 
that are installed (cast, poured, pumped, sprayed, vibrated) on site. Types of monolithic refractories include the following: mortars, plastics, castable, ramming, and patching.

Abrasive ceramics (in particulate form) are used to wear, grind, or cut away other ma-terial, which necessarily is softer. The abrasive action occurs by rubbing action of the abrasive, under pressure, against the surface to be abraded, which surface is worn away. The prime requisite for this group of materials is hardness or wear resistance; most abra-sive materials have a Mohs hardness of at least 7. In addition, a high degree of toughness is essential to ensure that the abrasive particles do not easily fracture. Furthermore, high temperatures may be produced from abrasive frictional forces, so some refractoriness is also desirable. Common applications for abrasives include grinding, polishing, lapping, drilling, cutting, sharpening, buffing, and sanding. A host of manufacturing and high-tech industries use these materials.
Abrasive materials are sometimes classified as naturally occurring (minerals that 
are mined) and manufactured (created by a manufacturing process); some abrasives (e.g., diamond) fall into both classifications. Naturally occurring abrasives include the following: diamond, corundum (aluminum oxide), emery (impure corundum), garnet, calcite (calcium carbonate), pumice, rouge (an iron oxide), and sand. Those that fall within the manufactured category are as follows: diamond, corundum, borazon (cubic boron nitride or CBN), carborundum (silicon carbide), zirconia–alumina, and boron carbide. Those extremely hard manufactured abrasives (e.g., diamond, borazon, and boron carbide) are sometimes termed superabrasives. The abrasive selected for a specific application will depend on the hardness of the work-piece material, its size, and its shape, as well as the desired finish.
Several factors influence the rate of surface removal and the abraded surface 
smoothness. These include the following:
 • Difference in hardness between abrasive and work-piece to be ground/polished. The 
greater this difference, the faster and deeper the cutting action.
 • Grain size—the larger (coarser) the grains, the more rapid the abrasion and the 
rougher the ground surface. Abrasive media containing small (fi  ne) grains are used 
to produce smooth and highly polished work-piece surfaces. Furthermore, all abra-
sive media consist of a distribution of grain (particle) sizes. Average particle size for abrasives ranges between about 1 μm and 2 mm (2000 μm) for fi  ne and coarse grains, respectively.
 • Contact force created between abrasive and work-piece surface; the higher this 
force, the faster the rate of abrasion.
Abrasives are used in three forms—as bonded abrasives, coated abrasives, and loose 
grains. • Bonded abrasives consist of abrasive grains that are embedded within some type 
of matrix and typically bonded to a wheel (grinding, polishing, and cut-off abrasive ceramic13.6 ABRASIVES
450  •   Chapter 13  /  Applications and Processing of Ceramics
wheels)—abr asive action is achieved by rotation of the wheel. Resin/bonding mate-
rials include glassy ceramics, polymer resins, shellacs, and rubbers. The surface struc-
ture should contain some porosity; a continual fl  ow of air currents or liquid coolants within the pores that surround the refractory grains prevents excessive heating. Fig-ure 13.5 shows the microstructure of a bonded abrasive, revealing abrasive grains, the bonding phase, and pores. Applications for bonded abrasives include saws to cut concrete, asphalt, metals, and for sectioning specimens for metallographic analysis; and wheels for grinding, sharpening, and deburring. The photograph of Figure 13.6 is of a clutch lining pressure plate that is being ground with a grinding wheel.

13.7 Cements  •   451
 • Coated abrasives are those in which abrasive particles are affi  xed (using an adhe-
sive) to some type of cloth or paper backing material; sandpaper is probably the 
most familiar example. Typical backing materials include paper, and several types of fabrics—for example, rayon, cotton, polyester, and nylon; backings may be fl exible or rigid. Polymers are commonly used for backing-particle adhesives—for 
example, phenolics, epoxies, acrylates, and glues. Alumina, alumina–zirconia, silicon carbide, garnet, and the superabrasives are possible abrasive components. Typical applications for the coated abrasives are abrasive belts, hand-held abrasive tools, and for lapping (i.e., polishing) of wood, ophthalmic equipment, glass, plastics, jewelry, and ceramic materials.
 • Grinding, lapping, and polishing wheels often employ loose abrasive grains that are 
delivered in some type of oil- or water-based vehicle. Particles are not bonded to another surface, but are free to roll or slide; their sizes run in the micron and submicron ranges. Loose abrasive processes are typically used in high-precision fi  nishing opera-
tions. The objectives of lapping and polishing are different. Whereas polishing is used to reduce surface roughness, the purpose of lapping is to improve the accuracy of an object’s shape—for example, to increase the fl  atness of fl  at objects and the sphericity of spherical balls. Typical applications for loose abrasives include mechanical seals, jewel watch bearings, magnetic recording heads, electronic circuit substrates, auto-motive parts, surgical instruments, and optical fi  ber connectors.
It should be noted that bonded abrasives (sectioning saws), coated abrasives, and 
loose abrasive grains are used to cut, grind, and polish specimens for microscopic exami-nation as discussed in Section 4.10.
Several familiar ceramic materials are classified as inorganic cements: cement, plaster 
of Paris, and lime, which, as a group, are produced in extremely large quantities. The 
characteristic feature of these materials is that when mixed with water, they form a paste that subsequently sets and hardens. This trait is especially useful in that solid and rigid structures having just about any shape may be formed expeditiously. Also, some of these materials act as a bonding phase that chemically binds particulate aggregates into a single cohesive structure. Under these circumstances, the role of the cement is similar to that of the glassy bonding phase that forms when clay products and some refractory bricks are fired. One important difference, however, is that the cementitious bond  develops at room temperature. Of this group of materials, Portland cement is consumed in the largest tonnages. It is produced by grinding and intimately mixing clay and lime-bearing minerals in the proper proportions and then heating the mixture to about 1400 °C (2550°F) in a  rotary 
kiln; this process, sometimes called calcination, produces physical and  chemical changes 
in the raw materials. The resulting “clinker” product is then ground into a very fine  powder, to which is added a small amount of gypsum (CaSO
4–2H2O) to  retard the 
setting process. This product is Portland cement. The properties of Portland cement, including setting time and final strength, to a large degree depend on its composition. Several different constituents are found in Portland cement, the principal ones  being tricalcium silicate (3CaO–SiO
2) and dicalcium silicate (2CaO–SiO2). The setting 
and hardening of this material result from relatively complicated hydration reactions that occur among the various cement constituents and the water that is added. For  example, one hydration reaction involving dicalcium silicate is as follows:
 2CaO–SiO
2+xH2O  →  2CaO–SiO2–xH2O (13.1)cement

where x is variable that depends on how much water is available. These hydrated products 
are in the form of complex gels or crystalline substances that form the cementitious 
bond. Hydration reactions begin just as soon as water is added to the cement. These are first manifested as setting (the stiffening of the once-plastic paste), which takes place soon after mixing, usually within several hours. Hardening of the mass follows as a result of further hydration, a relatively slow process that may continue for as long as several years. It should be emphasized that the process by which cement hardens is not one of drying, but rather of hydration in which water actually participates in a chemical bonding reaction. Portland cement is termed a hydraulic cement because its hardness develops by chemical reactions with water. It is used primarily in mortar and concrete to bind aggre-gates of inert particles (sand and/or gravel) into a cohesive mass; these are considered to be composite materials (see Section 16.2). Other cement materials, such as lime, are nonhydraulic—that is, compounds other than water (e.g., CO
2) are involved in the hard-
ening reaction.

Ceramic materials are also used in a number of biomedical applications. Properties that make them desirable for use as biomaterials include chemical inertness, hardness, wear resistance, and low coefficient of friction; their prime liability is their disposition to brittle fracture (i.e., low fracture toughness values). Those ceramics typically used for implants (i.e., bioceramics) include crystalline oxide materials, glasses, and glass-ceramics. The 
following are typical examples of the use of bioceramic materials:
 • High-purity and dense aluminum oxide, a highly inert and unreactive ceramic, is 
used in some load-bearing, orthopedic applications (involving skeletal injuries)—for 
example, in artifi  cial hip prostheses. A highly porous form of alumina is used for bone repair and to assist the healing process. The implant acts as a structural  scaffold; new bone tissue grows into and infi  ltrates the pores (but does not replace the alumina).
 • Zirconia (the tetragonal form), partially stabilized with yttria [sometimes termed 
Y-TZP (yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystal)] is used in some orthopedic and dental applications. Some femoral heads for hip replacements are composed of high-purity and dense alumina to which has been added small particles of Y-TZP .
2 This type of 
zirconia has found another niche as a dental restoration material (e.g., for use in dental crowns).
 • When placed within the human body, the surfaces of some glasses and glass-ceramic 
materials interact with and bond to surrounding tissues (notably bone). Mechani-cally, these interfacial bonds are very strong, often equivalent to or greater than the str ength of either the tissue or the implant ceramic. Consequently, these 
glasses/glass-ceramics are used extensively as coatings on other materials to promote  bonding—for example as coatings on some metal orthopedic and dental implants.13.8 CERAMIC BIOMATERIALS
2This material has a relatively large fracture toughness as a result of the phenomenon of transformation toughening, 
which is discussed in Section 16.10.
13.9 Carbons  •   453
 • For some bone injuries, it is desirable to implant a material that is gradually infi  ltrated 
with and replaced by natural bone tissue during the healing process. The implant 
ultimately dissolves and becomes absorbed (or resorbed) into the body of the host. Two types of calcium phosphate materials are typically used for these resorbable implants: tricalcium phosphate [Ca
3(PO4)2] and hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2].3 
The primary application of these resorbable ceramics is as porous bone grafts, which are used to replace bone loss or to assist in the repair of bone fractures. These ma-terials are also used for implantable drug-delivery systems.
3Some body tissues (found in bone and teeth) are natural composites that contain a calcium phosphate material 
similar to hydroxyapatite.Section 12.4 presented the crystal structures of two polymorphic forms of carbon— diamond and graphite. Furthermore, fibers are made of carbon materials that have other structures. In this section, we discuss these structures and, in addition, the important properties and applications for these three forms of carbon.
Diamond
The physical properties of diamond are extraordinary. Chemically, it is very inert and resistant to attack by a host of corrosive media. Of all known bulk materials, diamond is the hardest—as a result of its extremely strong interatomic sp
3 bonds. In addition, 
of all solids, it has the lowest sliding coefficient of friction. Its thermal conductivity is extremely high, its electrical properties are notable, and, optically, it is transparent in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum—in fact, it has the widest spectral transmission range of all materials. The high index of refraction and optical bril-liance of single crystals makes diamond a most highly valued gemstone. Several im portant 
properties of diamond, as well as other carbon materials, are listed in Table 13.3. It should be noted that diamond’s high modulus of elasticity and relatively low density 13.9 CARBONS

means it is extremely desirable for some applications that require a high specific stiffness 
(elastic modulus–density ratio). High-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) techniques to produce synthetic dia-monds were developed beginning in the mid-1950s. These techniques have been refined to the degree that today a large proportion of industrial-quality diamonds are synthetic, as are some of those of gem quality. The HPHT process can also be used to upgrade low-quality natural diamonds; in addition, natural diamonds may be colored by the incorporation of impurity atoms by diffusion. Industrial-grade diamonds are used for a host of applications that exploit diamond’s extreme hardness, wear resistance, and low coefficient of friction. These include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, dies for wire drawing, and as abrasives used in cutting, grinding, and polishing equipment (Section 13.6).
Polycrystalline Diamond
Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) —a solid aggregate of many small diamond crystals or 
grains—is used for some industrial applications. This form of diamond is created by sub-jecting synthetic diamond powders to high temperatures and high pressures (similar to the HPHT technique used to manufacture synthetic diamonds), a process that sinters the pow-der particles together and forms a cohesive mass. The sintering process is typically carried out with the diamond powder mass in contact with a tungsten carbide/cobalt mixture base support substrate. During sintering, cobalt diffuses from the base throughout the diamond powder; this process removes impurities from the diamond as well as catalyzes the diamond interparticle bonding reaction. Furthermore, a very strong bond forms between the carbide substrate and the PCD layer as a result of diffusional processes. Powder particle sizes are typically in the micron range, and two or more size ranges may be used to facilitate compaction. The sintering temperature is approximately 1400 °C, 
and pressures on the order of 1300 atm are required. Typically, PCD parts are manufac-tured as individual inserts or pads that are integrated into and attached to multicomponent cutters, drills, or bearings. Thus, an attachment mechanism is required, which is in the form of a tungsten carbide substrate that is integrally bonded to the PCD insert/pad during its HPHT treatment; the substrate also acts as a durable base and provides mechanical sup-port for the PCD. Attachment of the substrate/PCD insert/pad unit is possible by brazing, 
adhesives, or mechanical means. The properties of diamond single crystals (and each grain of a polycrystalline diamond) are anisotropic—that is, properties vary with crystallographic direction. This is  especially true of what is called cleavage —the tendency of a crystal (of diamond) to split or break 
apart along a specific crystallographic plane in response to a stress applied on that plane. Inasmuch as crystallographic orientations of the grains in a polycrystalline diamond are ran-dom, it is isotropic with respect to cleavage—that is, the susceptibility to cleavage is uniform in all directions (i.e., there is no preferred cleavage direction). Thus, this resistance to cleav-age of PCD materials leads to high degrees of strength, hardness, and wear resistance. Primary uses of PCD products are in the oil/gas exploration and hard rock mining industries—for example, drilling tools and bits, cutters, and downhole bearings. Other  applications include cutting tools for machining metals, and wire-drawing dies. The  extreme abrasion resistance combined with the high thermal conductivity of the diamond makes PCD an ideal material for hard rock mining. The high thermal conductivity of the diamond reduces the cutting-edge temperature of the PCD insert, which, in turn, reduces the edge wear rate. Also, although diamond is a brittle material, use of the tungsten carbide base improves the toughness of the diamond insert.
Graphite
As a consequence of its structure (Figure 12.17), graphite is highly anisotropic—property values depend on crystallographic direction along which they are measured. For  example, 
13.9 Carbons  •   455
electrical resistivities parallel and perpendicular to the graphene plane are, respectively, 
on the order of 10−5 and 10−2 Ω·m. Delocalized electrons are highly mobile, and their 
motions in response to the presence of an electric field applied in a direction parallel to the plane are responsible for the relatively low resistivity (i.e., high conductivity) in that direction. Also, as a consequence of the weak interplanar van der Waals bonds, it is relatively easy for planes to slide past one another, which explains the excellent lubrica-tive properties of graphite. There is a significant disparity between the properties of graphite and diamond, as may be noted in Table 13.3. For example, mechanically, graphite is very soft and flaky, and has a significantly smaller modulus of elasticity. Its in-plane electrical conductivity is 10
16 to 1019 times that of diamond, whereas thermal conductivities are approximately the 
same. Furthermore, whereas the coefficient of thermal expansion for diamond is rela-tively small and positive, graphite’s in-plane value is small and negative, and the plane-perpendicular coefficient is positive and relatively large. Graphite is optically opaque with a black–silver color. Other desirable properties of graphite include good chemical stability at elevated temperatures and in nonoxidizing atmospheres, high resistance to thermal shock, high adsorption of gases, and good machinability. Applications for graphite are many, varied, and include lubricants, pencils, battery electrodes, friction materials (e.g., brake shoes), heating elements for electric furnaces, welding electrodes, metallurgical crucibles, high-temperature refractories and insula-tions, rocket nozzles, chemical reactor vessels, electrical contacts (e.g., brushes), and air purification devices.
Carbon Fibers
Small-diameter, high-strength, and high-modulus fibers composed of carbon are used as reinforcements in polymer-matrix composites (Section 16.8). Carbon in these fiber  materials is in the form of graphene layers. However, depending on precursor (i.e., material from which the fibers are made) and heat treatment, different structural arrangements of these graphene layers exist. For what are termed graphitic carbon fibers, the graphene layers assume the ordered structure of graphite—planes are parallel to one another, hav-ing relatively weak van der Waals interplanar bonds. Alternatively, a more disordered structure results when, during fabrication, graphene sheets become randomly folded, tilted, and crumpled to form what is termed turbostratic carbon. Hybrid graphitic– 
turbostratic fibers, composed of regions of both structure types, may also be synthesized. Figure 13.7, a schematic structural representation of a hybrid fiber, shows both graphitic and turbostratic structures.
4 Graphitic fibers typically have higher elastic moduli than 
turbostratic fibers, whereas turbostratic fibers tend to be stronger. Furthermore, carbon fiber properties are anisotropic—strength and elastic modulus values are greater parallel to the fiber axis (the longitudinal direction) than perpendicular to it (the transverse or radial direction). Table 13.3 also lists typical property values for carbon fiber materials. Because most of these fibers are composed of both graphitic and turbostratic forms, the term carbon rather than graphite is used to denote these fibers. Of the three most common reinforcing fiber types used for polymer-reinforced composites (carbon, glass, and aramid), carbon fibers have the highest modulus of  elasticity and strength; in addition, they are the most expensive. Properties of these three (as well as other) fiber materials are compared in Table 16.4. Furthermore,  carbon fiber– reinforced polymer composites have outstanding modulus- and strength-to-weight ratios.
4Another form of turbostratic carbon— pyrolytic carbon —has properties that are isotropic. It is used extensively as a 
biomaterial because of its biocompatibility with some body tissues.

Although the traditional ceramics discussed previously account for the bulk of production, 
the development of new and what are termed advanced ceramics has begun and will 
continue to establish a prominent niche in advanced technologies. In particular, elec-trical, magnetic, and optical properties and property combinations unique to ceramics have been exploited in a host of new products; some of these are discussed in Chapters 18, 20, and 21. Advanced ceramics include materials used in microelectromechanical systems as well as the nanocarbons (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene). These are discussed next.
Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)
Microelectromechanical systems (abbreviated MEMS) are miniature “smart” systems (Section 1.5) consisting of a multitude of mechanical devices that are integrated with large numbers of electrical elements on a substrate of silicon. The mechanical com-ponents are microsensors and microactuators. Microsensors collect environmental information by measuring mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical, and/or magnetic phenomena. The microelectronic components then process this sensory input and subse-quently render decisions that direct responses from the microactuator devices—devices that perform such responses as positioning, moving, pumping, regulating, and filtering. These actuating devices include beams, pits, gears, motors, and membranes, which are of microscopic dimensions, on the order of microns in size.

100 μm
 The processing of MEMS is virtually the same as that used for the production of 
silicon-based integrated circuits; this includes photolithographic, ion implantation, etch-ing, and deposition technologies, which are well established. In addition, some mechani-cal components are fabricated using micromachining techniques. MEMS components are very sophisticated, reliable, and minuscule in size. Furthermore, because the preceding fabrication techniques involve batch operations, the MEMS technology is very economi-cal and cost effective. There are some limitations to the use of silicon in MEMS. Silicon has a low fracture toughness ( ∼0.90 MPa
√m) and a relatively low softening temperature (600°C) and 
is highly active to the presence of water and oxygen. Consequently, research is being conducted into using ceramic materials—which are tougher, more refractory, and more inert—for some MEMS components, especially high-speed devices and nanoturbines. The ceramic materials being considered are amorphous silicon carbonitrides (silicon carbide–silicon nitride alloys), which may be produced using metal organic precursors. One example of a practical MEMS application is an accelerometer (accelerator/decelerator sensor) that is used in the deployment of air bag systems in automobile crashes. For this application, the important microelectronic component is a free-standing micro-beam. Compared to conventional air bag systems, the MEMS units are smaller, lighter, and more reliable and are produced at a considerable cost reduction. Potential MEMS applications include electronic displays, data storage units, energy conversion devices, chemical detectors (for hazardous chemical and biological agents and drug screening), and microsystems for DNA amplification and identification. There are undoubtedly many unforeseen uses of this MEMS technology that will have a  profound impact on society; these will probably overshadow the effects that microelec-tronic integrated circuits have had during the past four decades.
Nanocarbons
A class of recently discovered carbon materials, the nanocarbons, have novel and excep-tional properties; they are currently being used in some cutting-edge technologies and will certainly play an important role in future high-tech applications. Three nanocarbons that belong to this class are fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. The “nano” prefix denotes that the particle size is less than about 100 nanometers. In addition, the carbon atoms in each nanoparticle are bonded to one another through hybrid sp
2 orbitals.5nanocarbon
5As with graphite, delocalized electrons are associated with these sp2 bonds; these bonds are confined to within the molecule.

Fullerenes
 One type of fullerene, discovered in 1985, consists of a hollow spherical cluster of 60 
carbon atoms; a single molecule is denoted by C60. Carbon atoms bond together so as to 
form both hexagonal (six-carbon atom) and pentagonal (five-carbon atom) geometrical configurations. One such molecule, shown in Figure 13.9, is found to consist of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons, which are arrayed such that no two pentagons share a common side; the molecular surface thus exhibits the symmetry of a soccer ball. The material composed of C
60 molecules is known as buckminsterfullerene (or buckyball for short), named in honor 
of R. Buckminster Fuller, who invented the geodesic dome; each C60 is simply a molecular 
replica of such a dome. The term fullerene is used to denote the class of materials that are composed of this type of molecule.
6
 In the solid state, the C60 units form a crystalline structure and pack together in a face-
centered cubic array. This material is called fullerite, and Table 13.4 lists some of its properties. A number of fullerene compounds have been developed that have unusual chemical, physical, and biological characteristics and are being used or have the potential to be used in a host of new applications. Some of these compounds involve atoms or groups Figure 13.9  The structure 
of a C60 fullerene molecule 
(schematic).
6Fullerene molecules other than C60 exist (e.g., C50, C70, C76, C84) that also form hollow, spherelike clusters. Each of 
these is composed of 12 pentagons, whereas the number of hexagons is variable. Material

of atoms that are encapsulated within the cage of carbon atoms (and are termed endo-
hedral fullerenes). For other compounds, atoms, ions, or clusters of atoms are attached to the outside of the fullerene shell (exohedral fullerenes). Uses and potential applications of fullerenes include antioxidants in personal care products, biopharmaceuticals, catalysts, organic solar cells, long-life batteries, high-temperature superconductors, and molecular magnets.
Carbon Nanotubes
 Another molecular form of carbon has recently been discovered that has some unique and technologically promising properties. Its structure consists of a single sheet of graphite (i.e., graphene) that is rolled into a tube and represented schematically in Figure 13.10; the term single-walled carbon nanotube (abbreviated SWCNT) is used to denote this structure. Each nanotube is a single molecule composed of millions of atoms; the length of this molecule is much greater (on the order of thousands of times greater) than its diameter. Multiple-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) consisting of 
concentric cylinders also exist.
 Nanotubes are extremely strong and stiff and relatively ductile. For single-walled nanotubes, measured tensile strengths range between 13 and 53 GPa (approximately an order of magnitude greater than for carbon fibers—viz. 2 to 6 GPa); this is one of the strongest known materials. Elastic modulus values are on the order of one tera-pascal [TPa (1 TPa = 10
3 GPa)], with fracture strains between about 5% and 20%. 
Furthermore, nanotubes have relatively low densities. Several properties of single-walled nanotubes are presented in Table 13.4. On the basis of their exceedingly high strengths, carbon nanotubes have the potential to be used in structural applications. Most current applications, however, are limited to the use of bulk nanotubes—collections of unorganized tube segments. Thus, bulk  nanotube materials will most likely never achieve strengths comparable to individual tubes. Bulk nanotubes are currently being used as reinforcements in polymer-matrix  nanocomposites (Section 16.16) to improve not only mechanical strength, but also thermal and electrical properties. Carbon nanotubes also have unique and structure-sensitive electrical character-istics. Depending on the orientation of the hexagonal units in the graphene plane 
(i.e., tube wall) with the tube axis, the nanotube may behave electrically as either a metal or a  semiconductor. As a metal, they have the potential for use as wiring for 
Figure 13.10  The structure of

small-scale circuits. In the semiconducting state they may be used for transistors and 
diodes. Furthermore, nanotubes are excellent electric field emitters. As such, they can be used for flat-screen displays (e.g., television screens and computer monitors). Other potential applications are varied and numerous, and include the following:
 • More efficient solar cells
 • Better capacitors to replace batteries • Heat removal applications • Cancer treatments (target and destroy cancer cells) • Biomaterial applications (e.g., artificial skin, monitor and evaluate engineered tissues) • Body armor • Municipal water-treatment plants (more efficient removal of pollutants and 
 contaminants)
Graphene
 Graphene, the newest member of the nanocarbons, is a single atomic layer of graphite, 
composed of hexagonally sp2 bonded carbon atoms (Figure 13.11). These bonds are 
 extremely strong, yet flexible, which allows the sheets to bend. The first graphene ma-terial was produced by peeling apart a piece of graphite layer by layer using plastic adhe-sive tape, until only a single layer of carbon remained.
7 Although pristine graphene is 
still produced using this technique (which is very expensive), other processes have been developed that yield high-quality graphene at much lower costs. Two characteristics of graphene make it an exceptional material. First is the perfect order found in its sheets—no atomic defects such as vacancies exist; also, these sheets are extremely pure—only carbon atoms are present. The second characteristic relates to the nature of the unbonded electrons: At room temperature, they move much faster than conducting electrons in ordinary metals and semiconducting materials.
8
 In terms of its properties (some are listed in Table 13.4), graphene could be labeled the ultimate material. It is the strongest known material (~130 GPa), the best thermal 
conductor (~5000 W/m
·K), and has the lowest electrical resistivity  (10−8 Ω·m)—that 
is, is the best electrical conductor. Furthermore, it is transparent, chemically inert, and has a modulus of elasticity comparable to the other nanocarbons (~1 TPa).
7This process is known as micromechanical exfoliation, or the adhesive tape method.
8This phenomenon is called ballistic conduction.Figure 13.11  The structure of a graphene 
layer (schematic).
13.10 Advanced Ceramics  •   461
 Given this set of properties, the technological potential for graphene is enormous, 
and it is expected to revolutionize many industries, including electronics, energy, trans-portation, medicine/biotechnology, and aeronautics. However, before this revolution can begin to be realized, economical and reliable methods for the mass production of graphene must be devised. The following is a short list of some of these potential applications for graph-ene: electronics—touch-screens, conductive ink for electronic printing, transparent 
conductors, transistors, heat sinks; energy—polymer solar cells, catalysts in fuel cells, battery electrodes, supercapacitors; medicine/biotechnology—artificial muscle, enzyme and DNA biosensors, photoimaging; aeronautics—chemical sensors (for explosives) and nanocomposites for aircraft structural components.
One chief concern in the application of ceramic materials is the method of fabrication. Many of the metal-forming operations discussed in Chapter 11 rely on casting and/or techniques that involve some form of plastic deformation. Because ceramic materials have rel-
atively high melting temperatures, casting them is normally impractical. Furthermore, in most instances the brittleness of these materials precludes deformation. Some  ceramic pieces are formed from powders (or particulate collections) that must ultimately be dried and fired. Glass shapes are formed at elevated temperatures from a fluid mass that becomes very viscous upon cooling. Cements are shaped by placing into forms a fluid paste that hardens and assumes a permanent set by virtue of chemical reactions. A taxonomical scheme for the several types of ceramic-forming techniques is presented in Figure 13.12.

Glass Properties
Before we discuss specific glass-forming techniques, some of the temperature-sensitive 
properties of glass materials must be presented. Glassy, or noncrystalline, materials do not solidify in the same sense as do those that are crystalline. Upon cooling, a glass becomes more and more viscous in a continuous manner with decreasing temperature; there is no definite temperature at which the liquid transforms into a solid as with  crystalline materials. In fact, one of the distinctions between crystalline and noncrystalline materials lies in the dependence of specific volume (or volume per unit mass, the reciprocal of density) on temperature, as illustrated in Figure 13.13. For crystalline materials, there is a discontinuous decrease in volume at the melting temperature T
m. However, for glassy 
materials, volume decreases continuously with temperature reduction; a slight decrease in slope of the curve occurs at what is called the glass transition temperature, or fictive 
temperature, T
g. Below this temperature, the material is considered to be a glass; above 
it, the material is first a supercooled liquid and, finally, a liquid. Also important in glass-forming operations are the viscosity–temperature character-istics of the glass. Figure 13.14 plots the logarithm of viscosity versus the temperature for fused silica, high silica, borosilicate, and soda–lime glasses. On the viscosity scale, several specific points that are important in the fabrication and processing of glasses are labeled:
 1. The melting point corresponds to the temperature at which the viscosity is 10 Pa
·s 
(100 P); the glass is fluid enough to be considered a liquid.
 2. The working point represents the temperature at which the viscosity is 103 Pa ·s 
(104 P); the glass is easily deformed at this viscosity.
 3. The softening point, the temperature at which the viscosity is 4 × 106 Pa ·s (4 ×  107 P), 
is the maximum temperature at which a glass piece may be handled without causing 
significant dimensional alterations.
 4. The annealing point is the temperature at which the viscosity is 1012 Pa ·s (1013 P); 
at this temperature, atomic diffusion is sufficiently rapid that any residual stresses may be removed within about 15 min.
 5. The strain point corresponds to the temperature at which the viscosity becomes 
3 × 10
13 Pa ·s (3 ×  1014 P); for temperatures below the strain point, fracture will 
occur before the onset of plastic deformation. The glass transition temperature will be above the strain point.glass transition

 Most glass-forming operations are carried out within the working range—between 
the working and softening temperatures. The temperature at which each of these points occurs depends on glass composition. For example, from Figure 13.14, the softening points for soda–lime and 96% silica glasses are about 700°C and 1550°C (1300°F and 2825°F), respectively. That is,  forming operations may be carried out at significantly lower temperatures for the soda–lime glass. The formability of a glass is tailored to a large degree by its composition.
Glass Forming
Glass is produced by heating the raw materials to an elevated temperature above which melt-ing occurs. Most commercial glasses are of the silica–soda–lime variety; the silica is usually supplied as common quartz sand, whereas Na
2O and CaO are added as soda ash (Na2CO3) 
and limestone (CaCO3). For most applications, especially when optical transparency is 
important, it is essential that the glass product be homogeneous and pore free. Homogeneity is achieved by complete melting and mixing of the raw ingredients. Porosity results from small gas bubbles that are produced; these must be absorbed into the melt or otherwise eliminated, which requires proper adjustment of the viscosity of the molten material. Five different forming methods are used to fabricate glass products: pressing, blowing, drawing, and sheet and fiber forming. Pressing is used in the fabrication of relatively thick-walled pieces such as plates and dishes. The glass piece is formed by pressure application in a graphite-coated cast iron mold having the desired shape; the mold is typically heated to ensure an even surface. Although some glass blowing is done by hand, especially for art objects, the process has been completely automated for the production of glass jars, bottles, and light bulbs. The several steps involved in one such technique are illustrated in Figure 13.15. From a raw gob of glass, a parison, or temporary shape, is formed by mechanical pressing in a mold. This piece is inserted into a finishing or blow mold and forced to conform to the mold contours by the pressure created from a blast of air.Figure 13.14  Logarithm of viscosity versus

Figure 13.16  Schematic diagram showing the float process for making sheet glass. 
(Courtesy of Pilkington Group Limited.) Drawing is used to form long glass pieces that have a constant cross section, such as 
sheet, rod, tubing, and fibers. Until the late 1950s, sheet glass (or plate) was produced by casting (or drawing) the glass into a plate shape, grinding both faces to make them flat and parallel, and finally, polishing the faces to make the sheet transparent—a procedure that was relatively expensive. A more economical float process was patented in 1959 in England. With this technique (represented schematically in Figure 13.16), the molten glass passes (on rollers) from one furnace onto a bath of liquid tin located in a second furnace. Thus, as this continuous glass ribbon “floats” on the surface of the molten tin, gravitational and surface tension forces cause the faces to become perfectly flat and parallel and the resulting sheet to be of uniform thickness. Furthermore, sheet faces acquire a bright, “fire-polished” finish in one region of the furnace. The sheet next passes into an annealing furnace (lehr), and is

finally cut into sections (Figure 13.16). The success of this operation requires rigid control 
of both temperature and chemistry of the gaseous atmosphere. Some continuous glass fibers are formed in a rather sophisticated drawing opera-tion. The molten glass is contained in a platinum heating chamber. Fibers are formed by drawing the molten glass through many small orifices at the chamber base. The glass viscosity, which is critical, is controlled by chamber and orifice temperatures.
Heat-Treating Glasses
Annealing
 When a ceramic material is cooled from an elevated temperature, internal stresses, called thermal stresses, may be introduced as a result of the difference in cooling rate and thermal contraction between the surface and interior regions. These thermal stresses are important in brittle ceramics, especially glasses, because they may weaken the material or, in extreme cases, lead to fracture, which is termed thermal shock (see Section 19.5). Normally, attempts 
are made to avoid thermal stresses, which may be  accomplished by cooling the piece at a sufficiently slow rate. Once such stresses have been introduced, however, elimination, or at least a reduction in their magnitude, is  possible by an annealing heat treatment in which the glassware is heated to the annealing point, then slowly cooled to room temperature.
Glass Tempering
 The strength of a glass piece may be enhanced by intentionally inducing compres-sive residual surface stresses. This can be accomplished by a heat treatment procedure called thermal tempering. With this technique, the glassware is heated to a temperature 
above the glass transition region yet below the softening point. It is then cooled to room temperature in a jet of air or, in some cases, an oil bath. The residual stresses arise from  differences in cooling rates for surface and interior regions. Initially, the surface cools more rapidly and, once it has dropped to a temperature below the strain point, it becomes rigid. At this time, the interior, having cooled less rapidly, is at a higher temperature (above the strain point) and, therefore, is still plastic. With continued cooling, the interior attempts to contract to a greater degree than the now-rigid exterior will allow. Thus, the inside tends to draw in the outside, or to impose inward radial stresses. As a consequence, after the glass piece has cooled to room temperature, it sustains compressive stresses on the surface and tensile stresses at interior regions. The room-temperature stress distribu-tion over a cross section of a glass plate is represented schematically in Figure 13.17.thermal shock

 The failure of ceramic materials almost always results from a crack that is initiated at 
the surface by an applied tensile stress. To cause fracture of a tempered glass piece, the magnitude of an externally applied tensile stress must be great enough to first overcome the residual compressive surface stress and, in addition, to stress the surface in  tension sufficient to initiate a crack, which may then propagate. For an untempered glass, a crack is introduced at a lower external stress level, and, consequently, the fracture strength is smaller. Tempered glass is used for applications in which high strength is important; these include large doors and eyeglass lenses.

Fabrication and Heat-Treating of Glass-Ceramics
The first stage in the fabrication of a glass-ceramic ware is forming it into the desired shape 
as a glass. Forming techniques used are the same as for glass pieces, as described previously (e.g., pressing and drawing). Conversion of the glass into a glass-ceramic (i.e., crystalliza-tion, Section 13.3) is accomplished by appropriate heat treatments. One such set of heat 
treatments for a Li
2O–Al2O3–SiO2 glass-ceramic is detailed in the time-versus-temperature 
plot of Figure 13.18. After melting and forming operations, nucleation and growth of the crystalline phase particles are carried out isothermally at two different temperatures.1600

As Section 13.4 noted, this class of materials includes the structural clay products and 
the whitewares. In addition to clay, many of these products also contain other ingredients. After being formed, pieces most often must be subjected to drying and firing operations; each of the ingredients influences the changes that take place during these processes and the characteristics of the finished piece.13.12 FABRICATION AND PROCESSING OF CLAY PRODUCTS
13.12 Fabrication and Processing of Clay Products   •  467
9Flux, in the context of clay products, is a substance that promotes the formation of a glassy phase during the firing 
heat treatment.The Characteristics of Clay
The clay minerals play two very important roles in ceramic bodies. First, when water 
is added, they become very plastic, a condition termed hydroplasticity. This property 
is very important in forming operations, as discussed shortly. In addition, clay fuses or melts over a range of temperatures; thus, a dense and strong ceramic piece may be  produced during firing without complete melting such that the desired shape is maintained. This fusion temperature range depends on the composition of the clay. Clays are aluminosilicates composed of alumina (Al
2O3) and silica (SiO2) that  contain 
chemically bound water. They have a broad range of physical characteristics, chemical compositions, and structures; common impurities include compounds  (usually oxides) of barium, calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, and also some organic matter. Crystal structures 
for the clay minerals are relatively complicated; however, one  prevailing characteristic is a layered structure. The most common clay minerals that are of interest have what is called the kaolinite structure. Kaolinite clay [Al
2(Si2O5)(OH)4] has the crystal structure shown 
in Figure 12.14. When water is added, the water  molecules fit between these layered sheets and form a thin film around the clay particles. The particles are thus free to move over one 
another, which accounts for the resulting plasticity of the water–clay mixture.
Compositions of Clay Products
In addition to clay, many of these products (in particular the whitewares) also contain some nonplastic ingredients; the nonclay minerals include flint, or finely ground quartz, and a flux such as feldspar.
9 The quartz is used primarily as a filler material,  being 
inexpensive, relatively hard, and chemically unreactive. It experiences little change  during high-temperature heat treatment because it has a melting temperature well above the normal firing temperature; when melted, however, quartz has the ability to form a glass. When mixed with clay, a flux forms a glass that has a relatively low melting point. The feldspars are some of the more common fluxing agents; they are a group of alumi-nosilicate materials that contain K
+, Na+, and Ca2+ ions.
 As expected, the changes that take place during drying and firing processes, and also the characteristics of the finished piece, are influenced by the proportions of the three constituents: clay, quartz, and flux. A typical porcelain might contain approximately 50% clay, 25% quartz, and 25% feldspar.
Fabrication Techniques
The as-mined raw materials usually have to go through a milling or grinding operation in which particle size is reduced; this is followed by screening or sizing to yield a  powdered product having a desired range of particle sizes. For multicomponent systems,  powders must be thoroughly mixed with water and perhaps other ingredients to give flow  characteristics that are compatible with the particular forming technique. The formed piece must have sufficient mechanical strength to remain intact during transporting,  drying, 
and firing operations. Two common shaping techniques are used to form  clay-based compositions: hydroplastic forming and slip casting.
Hydroplastic Forming
 As mentioned previously, clay minerals, when mixed with water, become highly plastic and pliable and may be molded without cracking; however, they have extremely low yield strengths. The consistency (water–clay ratio) of the hydroplastic mass must give a yield strength sufficient to permit a formed ware to maintain its shape during handling and drying.hydroplastic forming
slip casting
468  •   Chapter 13  /  Applications and Processing of Ceramics
 The most common hydroplastic forming technique is extrusion, in which a stiff 
plastic ceramic mass is forced through a die orifice having the desired cross-sectional geometry; it is similar to the extrusion of metals (Figure 11.9 c). Brick, pipe, ceramic 
blocks, and tiles are all commonly fabricated using hydroplastic forming. Usually the plastic ceramic is forced through the die by means of a motor-driven auger, and often air is removed in a vacuum chamber to enhance the density. Hollow internal columns in the extruded piece (e.g., building brick) are formed by inserts situated within the die.
Slip Casting
 Another forming process used for clay-based compositions is slip casting. A slip is a suspension of clay and/or other nonplastic materials in water. When poured into a porous mold (commonly made of plaster of Paris), water from the slip is absorbed into the mold, leaving behind a solid layer on the mold wall, the thickness of which depends on the time. This process may be continued until the entire mold cavity becomes solid (solid casting), as demonstrated in Figure 13.19 a. Alternatively, it may be terminated 
when the solid shell wall reaches the desired thickness, by inverting the mold and pouring out the excess slip; this is termed drain casting (Figure 13.19b). As the cast piece dries 
and shrinks, it pulls away (or releases) from the mold wall; at this time, the mold may be disassembled and the cast piece removed. The nature of the slip is extremely important; it must have a high specific gravity and yet be very fluid and pourable. These characteristics depend on the solid-to-water ratio and other agents that are added. A satisfactory casting rate is an essential requirement. In addition, the cast piece must be free of bubbles, and it must have low drying shrink-age and relatively high strength.

 The properties of the mold influence the quality of the casting. Normally, plaster of 
Paris, which is economical, relatively easy to fabricate into intricate shapes, and reusable, is used as the mold material. Most molds are multipiece items that must be assembled before casting. The mold porosity may be varied to control the casting rate. The rather complex ceramic shapes that may be produced by means of slip casting include sanitary lavatory ware, art objects, and specialized scientific laboratory ware such as 
ceramic tubes.
Drying and Firing
A ceramic piece that has been formed hydroplastically or by slip casting retains signifi-cant porosity and has insufficient strength for most practical applications. In addition, it may still contain some of the liquid (e.g., water) that was added to assist in the forming operation. This liquid is removed in a drying process; density and strength are enhanced as a result of a high-temperature heat treatment or firing procedure. A body that has been formed and dried but not fired is termed green. Drying and firing techniques are 
critical inasmuch as defects that ordinarily render the ware useless (e.g., warpage, dis-tortion, cracks) may be introduced during the operation. These defects normally result from stresses that are set up from nonuniform shrinkage.
Drying
 As a clay-based ceramic body dries, it also experiences some shrinkage. In the early stages of drying, the clay particles are virtually surrounded by and separated from one another by a thin film of water. As drying progresses and water is removed, the inter-particle separation decreases, which is manifested as shrinkage (Figure 13.20). During  drying it is critical to control the rate of water removal. Drying at interior regions of a body is accomplished by the diffusion of water molecules to the surface, where evaporation occurs. If the rate of evaporation is greater than the rate of diffusion, the surface will dry (and as a consequence shrink) more rapidly than the interior, with a high probability of the formation of the aforementioned defects. The rate of surface evaporation should be reduced to, at most, the rate of water diffusion; evaporation rate may be controlled by temperature, humidity, and rate of airflow. Other factors also influence shrinkage. One of these is body thickness; nonuniform shrinkage and defect formation are more pronounced in thick pieces than in thin ones. Water content of the formed body is also critical: The greater the water content, the more extensive is the shrinkage. Consequently, the water content is typically kept as low as possible. Clay particle size also has an influence; shrinkage is enhanced as the particle size is decreased. To minimize shrinkage, the size of the particles may be increased, or nonplastic materials having relatively large particles may be added to the clay. Microwave energy may also be used to dry ceramic wares. One advantage of this technique is that the high temperatures used in conventional methods are avoided; drying temperatures may be kept to below 50 °C (120° F). This is important because the drying 
temperature of some temperature-sensitive materials should be kept as low as possible.green ceramic body

wares. Why is this so?

Firing
 After drying, a body is usually fired at a temperature between 900° C and 1400° C 
(1650° F and 2550° F); the firing temperature depends on the composition and desired 
properties of the finished piece. During the firing operation, the density is further in-
creased (with an attendant decrease in porosity) and the mechanical strength is enhanced. When clay-based materials are heated to elevated temperatures, some rather complex and involved reactions occur. One of these is vitrification —the gradual formation of a 
liquid glass that flows into and fills some of the pore volume. The degree of vitrification depends on firing temperature and time, as well as on the composition of the body. The temperature at which the liquid phase forms is lowered by the addition of fluxing agents such as feldspar. This fused phase flows around the remaining unmelted particles and fills in the pores as a result of surface tension forces (or capillary action); shrinkage also 
accompanies this process. Upon cooling, this fused phase forms a glassy matrix that results in a dense, strong body. Thus, the final microstructure consists of the  vitrified phase, any unreacted quartz particles, and some porosity. Figure 13.21 is a scanning  electron micrograph of a fired porcelain in which these microstructural elements may be seen.vitrification

 The degree of vitrification controls the room-temperature properties of the ceramic 
ware; strength, durability, and density are all enhanced as it increases. The firing temper-ature determines the extent to which vitrification occurs—that is, vitrification increases as the firing temperature is raised. Building bricks are typically fired around 900 °C (1650° F) 
and are relatively porous. However, firing of highly vitrified porcelain, which borders on being optically translucent, takes place at much higher temperatures. Complete vitrifica-tion is avoided during firing because a body becomes too soft and will collapse.

Several ceramic-forming techniques have already been discussed relative to the fab-
rication of glass and clay products. Another important and commonly used method that warrants brief treatment is powder pressing. Powder pressing —the ceramic 
analogue to powder metallurgy—is used to fabricate both clay and nonclay composi-tions, including electronic and magnetic ceramics, as well as some refractory brick products. In essence, a powdered mass, usually containing a small amount of water or other binder, is compacted into the desired shape by pressure. The degree of com-paction is maximized and the fraction of void space is minimized by using coarse and fine particles mixed in  appropriate proportions. There is no plastic deformation of the particles during compaction, as there may be with metal powders. One function of the binder is to lubricate the powder particles as they move past one another in the compaction process. There are three basic powder-pressing procedures: uniaxial, isostatic (or hydrostatic), and hot pressing. For uniaxial pressing, the powder is compacted in a metal die by  pressure that is applied in a single direction. The formed piece takes on the configuration of the die and platens through which the pressure is applied. This method is confined to shapes that are relatively simple; however, production rates are high and the process is inexpensive. The steps involved in one technique are illustrated in Figure 13.22.13.13 POWDER PRESSING

 For isostatic pressing, the powdered material is contained in a rubber envelope and 
the pressure is applied isostatically by a fluid (i.e., it has the same magnitude in all directions). More complicated shapes are possible than with uniaxial pressing; however, the isostatic technique is more time consuming and expensive. For both uniaxial and isostatic procedures, a firing operation is required after the pressing operation. During firing the formed piece shrinks and experiences a reduction of porosity and an improvement in mechanical integrity. These changes occur by the coalescence of the powder particles into a denser mass in a process termed sintering. 
The mechanism of sintering is schematically illustrated in Figure 13.23. After pressing, many of the powder particles touch one another (Figure 13.23 a). During the initial 
sintering stage, necks form along the contact regions between adjacent particles; in  addition, a grain boundary forms within each neck, and every interstice between particles becomes a pore (Figure 13.23b). As sintering progresses, the pores become smaller and more spherical (Figure 13.23c ). A scanning electron micrograph of a sintered alumina 
material is shown in Figure 13.24. The driving force for sintering is the reduction in 
 total particle surface area; surface energies are larger in magnitude than grain boundary  energies. Sintering is carried out below the melting temperature, so that a liquid phase is

normally not present. The mass transport that is necessary to effect the changes shown 
in Figure 13.23 is accomplished by atomic diffusion from the bulk particles to the neck regions. With hot pressing, the powder pressing and heat treatment are performed simultaneously—the powder aggregate is compacted at an elevated temperature. The 
procedure is used for materials that do not form a liquid phase except at very high 
and impractical temperatures; in addition, it is used when high densities without ap-
preciable grain growth are desired. This is an expensive fabrication technique and has some limitations. It is costly in terms of time, because both mold and die must be heated and cooled during each cycle. In addition, the mold is usually expensive to 
fabricate and typically has a short lifetime.
Tape casting is an important ceramic fabrication technique. As the name implies, in this technique, thin sheets of a flexible tape are produced by means of a casting process. These sheets are prepared from slips in many respects similar to those employed for slip casting (Section 13.12). This type of slip consists of a suspension of ceramic particles in an organic liquid that also contains binders and plasticizers, which are incorporated to impart strength and flexibility to the cast tape. De-airing in a vacuum may also be nec-essary to remove any entrapped air or solvent vapor bubbles, which may act as crack-initiation sites in the finished piece. The actual tape is formed by pouring the slip onto a flat surface (of stainless steel, glass, a polymeric film, or paper); a doctor blade spreads the slip into a thin tape of uniform thickness, as shown schematically in Figure 13.25. In the drying process, volatile slip components are removed by evaporation; this green product is a flexible tape that may be cut or into which holes may be punched prior to a firing operation. Tape thicknesses normally range between 0.1 and 2 mm (0.004 and 0.08 in.). Tape casting is widely used in the production of ceramic substrates that are used for integrated circuits and for multilayered capacitors.
 Cementation is also considered a ceramic fabrication process (Figure 13.12). The 
cement material, when mixed with water, forms a paste that, after being fashioned into a desired shape, subsequently hardens as a result of complex chemical reactions. Cements and the cementation process were discussed briefly in Section 13.7.13.14 TAPE CASTING

3D printing (or additive manufacturing) is used to fabricate ceramic parts that are virtu-
ally free of cracks and porosity and have properties comparable to those manufactured using conventional techniques discussed earlier in this chapter. However, because of their relatively poor electrical and thermal conductivities, some of the printing tech-niques used for metals (Section 11.7) are impractical for ceramics. For example, electron beams cannot be used as heat sources because ceramics are electrical insulators. In addition, direct laser melting is difficult because ceramics typically have high melting temperatures; also for most ceramics there is a possibility of crack formation due to the generation of thermal stresses. Furthermore, the number of ceramic materials available for 3D printing is limited. For virtually all ceramic 3D printing techniques the material feedstock is in the form of a powder that, in some instances, may be incorporated within a liquid suspension. A variety of ceramic 3D printing processes have been developed, and we have chosen to discuss several of the common ones—ceramic jet printing, stereolithography, polymer-derived ceramics, and 3D clay extrusion.
Ceramic Jet Printing
The mechanism of the ceramic jet printing technology, as illustrated schematically in Figure 13.26, is relatively simple: A roller mechanism first spreads a thin layer of ceramic powder onto the build platform; an ink jet then selectively “prints” a binder onto only those regions of powder that are to be part of this layer for the desired solid part.
10 The binder bonds together powder particles with which it is in contact. This 
process is repeated until the printing process is complete. At this time, the “green” part is removed from the unbound powder bed in the printer and excess powder is removed. If necessary, volatile components may be driven off by heating the part in an oven. Finally, the powder particles are sintered together in a firing operation, which increases the strength and density of the finished piece. Porcelain is printed using this technique.13.15 3D PRINTING OF CERAMIC MATERIALS

13.15 3D Printing of Ceramic Materials   •  475
Stereolithography
For stereolithography ( SLA), the feedstock consists of a photocurable liquid monomer 
(unpolymerized polymer) resin that is loaded with a high level of ceramic powder 
particles. A sweep arm spreads a single layer of this feedstock suspension having a thickness of between about 25 and 100 μm out on the build platform (Figure 13.27). An 
ultraviolet laser next scans the pattern for this layer of the object onto the resin-ceramic particle suspension; this causes the polymer only in scanned regions to solidify (“cure” or “polymerize”).
11 Another layer is deposited and scanned in a similar manner, which 
again solidifies in only selected areas; in addition, the two layers become attached to one another. This process is repeated layer-by-layer until the complete object is created. At this time the solid object is extracted from the remaining uncured polymer-ceramic particle suspension, and all attached uncured residues are removed. Post-processing treatments begin with debinding—heating the object to about 400 °C; this burns off the 
cured polymer. A high-temperature sintering heat treatment follows, which leads to a dense and strong ceramic part. Ceramic materials typically printed using stereolithography include alumina (for technical ceramics, surgical instruments, electrical isolators) and zirconia (for jewelry, dental restorations, fuel cell components). Two other extremely biocompatible and bioresorbable materials, tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite, are printed into bio-medical implants that are used to restore bone loss.
Polymer-Derived Ceramics
A newly developed stereolithographic 3D printing technique has recently been developed that increases the number of available ceramic materials. With this technique, the precur-sor feedstock material is a “preceramic” monomer resin, which is laid down in layers that are on the order of 100 μ m thick. After deposition, each layer is exposed to ultraviolet 
light, which solidifies (cures or polymerizes) only regions that are to become a slice of the solid object. Note that at this point the final object is in the form of a polymer, not a ceramic. After completion of the printing process, all unpolymerized resin is washed away, and the solid object is heated to 1000° C in an atmosphere of argon. This heat treatment 
transforms (by pyrolysis) the polymer object into a ceramic material (a silicon oxycarbide). Shapes of these printed ceramic materials may be complicated, but are limited to having porous and cellular architectures. Furthermore, this silicon oxycarbide material

SUMMARY
• The familiar glass materials are noncrystalline silicates that contain other oxides. In 
addition to silica (SiO2), the two other primary ingredients of a typical soda–lime glass 
are soda (Na2O) and lime (CaO).
• The two prime assets of glass materials are optical transparency and ease of fabrication.Glasses
Glass-Ceramics • Glass-ceramics are initially fabricated as glasses and then, by heat treatment, crystallized 
to form fine-grained polycrystalline materials.
• Two properties of glass-ceramics that make them superior to glass are improved 
mechanical strengths and lower coefficients of thermal expansion (which improves 
thermal shock resistance).
Clay Products • Clay is the principal component of whitewares (e.g., pottery and tableware) and structural 
clay products (e.g., building bricks and tiles). Ingredients (in addition to clay) may be added, such as feldspar and quartz; these influence changes that occur during firing.
Refractories • Materials that are employed at elevated temperatures and often in reactive environments 
are termed refractory ceramics.
• Requirements for this class of materials include high melting temperature, the ability to 
remain unreactive and inert when exposed to severe environments (often at elevated temperatures), and the ability to provide thermal insulation.
• Common refractory ceramic materials include the following: fireclay, high-alumina, 
extra-high alumina, silica, periclase (high MgO content), zircon (zirconium silicate), and silicon carbide.
Abrasives • The abrasive ceramics are used to cut, grind, and polish other softer materials.
• This group of materials must be hard and tough and be able to withstand high 
 temperatures that arise from frictional forces.
• Two classifications of ceramic abrasive ceramics are naturally occurring and manufac-
tured. Those that occur naturally include diamond, corundum (Al
2O3), emery, garnet, 
and sand. Diamond, corundum, borazon (cubic boron nitride), carborundum (silicon 
carbide), zirconia–alumina, and boron carbide fall within the manufactured category.is quite refractory. Currently applications include thermal protection systems, porous burners, electronic device packaging, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
3D Clay Extrusion
A number of 3D printers for clay-based ceramics have been developed that are scaled-down and highly sophisticated hydroplastic-forming extruders (hydroplastic extrusion is discussed in Section 13.12). The printer head continuously extrudes a filament of paste, composed of clay, water (or other binder), and perhaps additional ingredients. Paste con-sistency must be such that the printed piece has sufficient structural integrity to maintain its shape. Some printers are designed for specific pastes; others have some flexibility in paste composition and consistency. The ability to remove air bubbles in the paste prior to printing is desirable in order to achieve a smooth and bubble-free finish. A major differ-ence between this technique and other printing techniques for ceramics discussed previ-ously is the size of the print element—element size is much larger for clay extrusion—for example, the thickness of a cup or dish. After printing, the part must be dried and fired in a manner similar to that described in Section 13.12 for slip cast and hydroplastically formed bodies. A decorative glaze may be applied prior to the firing heat treatment. 3D clay extrusion is used in several different areas including pottery (plates, cups, saucers, mugs) and ornamental/artisanal (statues, figurines, jewelry, planters).
Summary  •   477
Cements • Portland cement is produced by heating a mixture of clay and lime-bearing minerals 
in a rotary kiln. The resulting “clinker” is ground into very fine particles to which a 
small amount of gypsum is added.
• When mixed with water, inorganic cements form a paste that is capable of assuming 
just about any desired shape.
• Subsequent setting or hardening is a result of chemical reactions involving the cement 
particles and occurs at the ambient temperature. For hydraulic cements, of which Portland cement is the most common, the chemical reaction is one of hydration.
Ceramic Biomaterials • On the basis of chemical inertness, hardness, and wear resistance, a number of ceramics 
(bioceramics) are used in biomedical applications.
• Aluminum oxide (in high-purity/dense and porous forms), zirconia (yttria-stabilized), 
glasses and glass-ceramics, as well as two calcium phosphate materials (tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite) are common bioceramic materials.
• Typical applications of bioceramics are in the orthopedic (bone/skeletal) and dental fields.
Carbons • Two allotropic forms of carbon, diamond and graphite, have distinctively different 
sets of physical and chemical properties.
• Diamond is extremely hard, chemically inert, has a high thermal conductivity, a low 
electrical conductivity, and is transparent with a high index of refraction.
• Graphite is soft and flaky (i.e., has good lubricative properties), is optically opaque, 
and chemically stable at high temperatures and in nonoxidizing atmospheres. Some of its properties are highly anisotropic, to include electrical conductivity.
• A form of carbon used as a fiber reinforcement was also discussed.
Two structural arrangements of graphene layers may be found in carbon fibers—
graphitic and turbostratic (Figure 13.7).
High strengths and moduli of elasticity develop in the direction parallel to the fiber axis.
Advanced Ceramics • Many modern technologies use and will continue to use advanced ceramics because 
of their unique mechanical, chemical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties and property combinations.
• Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)—these are smart systems that consist of miniatur-
ized mechanical devices integrated with electrical elements on a substrate (normally silicon).
• Nanocarbons—carbon materials that have particle sizes less than about 100 nm. Three 
types of nanocarbons that can exist are as follows:
Fullerenes (e.g., C
60, Figure 13.9)
Carbon nanotubes (Figure 13.10)Graphene (Figure 13.11)
Fabrication and 
Processing of Glasses 
and Glass-Ceramics• Because glasses are formed at elevated temperatures, the temperature–viscosity 
behavior is an important consideration. Melting, working, softening, annealing, and strain points represent temperatures that correspond to specific viscosity values.
• Among the more common glass-forming techniques are pressing, blowing (Figure 13.15), 
drawing (Figure 13.16), and fiber forming.
• When glass pieces are cooled, internal thermal stresses may be generated because of 
differences in cooling rate (and degrees of thermal contraction) between interior and surfaces regions.
• After fabrication, glasses may be annealed and/or tempered to improve mechanical 
characteristics.
Fabrication and 
Processing of Clay 
Products• Clay minerals assume two roles in the fabrication of ceramic bodies:
When water is added to clay, it becomes pliable and amenable to forming.Clay minerals melt over a range of temperatures; thus, during firing, a dense and 
strong piece is produced without complete melting.
478  •   Chapter 13  /  Applications and Processing of Ceramics
Powder Pressing • Some ceramic pieces are formed by powder compaction; uniaxial, isostatic, and hot 
pressing techniques are possible.
• Densification of pressed pieces takes place by a sintering mechanism (Figure 13.23) 
during a high-temperature firing procedure.
Tape Casting • With tape casting, a thin sheet of ceramic of uniform thickness is formed from a slip 
that is spread onto a flat surface using a doctor blade (Figure 13.25). This tape is then 
subjected to drying and firing operations.
3D Printing of 
Ceramics• Several techniques have been developed for 3D printing of ceramic materials. The 
feedstock material is in powder form, which in some instances is incorporated within a liquid suspension.
• The following processes were described in this chapter: ceramic jet printing, stereo-
lithography, polymer-derived ceramics, and 3D clay extrusion.

For hydroplastic forming, a plastic and pliable mass is formed into a desired 
shape by forcing the mass through a die orifice.
With slip casting, a slip (suspension of clay and other minerals in water) is poured 
into a porous mold. As water is absorbed into the mold, a solid layer is deposited

480  •   WHY STUDY Polymer Structures?
Naturally occurring polymers—those derived from plants and animals—have been used 
for many centuries; these materials include wood, rubber, cotton, wool, leather, and silk. Other natural polymers, such as proteins, enzymes, starches, and cellulose, are important in biological and physiological processes in plants and animals. Modern scientific research tools have made possible the determination of the molecular structures of this group of materials and the development of numerous polymers that are synthesized from small organic molecules. Many of our useful plastics, rubbers, and fiber materials are synthetic polymers. In fact, since the conclusion of World War II, the field of materials has been vir-tually revolutionized by the advent of synthetic polymers. The synthetics can be produced inexpensively, and their properties may be managed to the degree that many are superior to their natural counterparts. In some applications, metal and wood parts have been re-placed by plastics, which have satisfactory properties and can be produced at a lower cost. As with metals and ceramics, the properties of polymers are intricately related to the structural elements of the material. This chapter explores molecular and crystal structures of polymers; Chapter 15 discusses the relationships between structure and some of the physical and chemical properties, along with typical applications and forming methods.
Because most polymers are organic in origin, we briefly review some of the basic concepts relating to the structure of their molecules. First, many organic materials are hydrocarbons —that is, they are composed of hydrogen and carbon. Furthermore, 
the intramolecular bonds are covalent. Each carbon atom has four electrons that may 14.1 INTRODUCTION
14.2 HYDROCARBON MOLECULESLearning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Describe a typical polymer molecule in terms of 
its chain structure and, in addition, how the molecule may be generated from repeat units.
2.  Draw repeat units for polyethylene, poly(vinyl 
chloride), polytetrafluoroethylene, polypropyl- ene, and polystyrene.
3.  Calculate number-average and weight-average 
molecular weights and degree of polymerization for a specified polymer.
4. Name and briefly describe:
(a)  the four general types of polymer molecular 
structures,(b) the three types of stereoisomers,(c)  the two kinds of geometric isomers, and(d) the four types of copolymers.
5.  Cite the differences in behavior and molecular 
structure for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers.
6.  Briefly describe the crystalline state in polymeric 
materials.
7.  Briefly describe/diagram the spherulitic structure 
for a semicrystalline polymer.A relatively large number of chemical and structural characteristics affect the properties and behaviors of polymeric materials. Some of these influences are as follows:1. Degree of crystallinity of semicrystalline polymers—on density, stiffness, strength, and ductility (Sections 14.11 and 15.8).2. Degree of crosslinking—on the stiffness of rubberlike materials (Section 15.9).3. Polymer chemistry—on melting and glass-transition temperatures (Section 15.14).
14.2 Hydrocarbon Molecules  •   481
participate in covalent bonding, whereas every hydrogen atom has only one bonding 
electron. A single covalent bond exists when each of the two bonding atoms contributes one electron, as represented schematically in Figure 2.12 for a molecule of hydrogen (H
2). Double and triple bonds between two carbon atoms involve the sharing of two and 
three pairs of electrons, respectively.1 For example, in ethylene, which has the chemical 
formula C2H4, the two carbon atoms are doubly bonded together, and each is also singly 
bonded to two hydrogen atoms, as represented by the structural formula

HHC
where ―anddenote single and double covalent bonds, respectively. An example of a 
triple bond is found in acetylene, C2H2:
C H H C
 Molecules that have double and triple covalent bonds are termed unsaturated —that 
is, each carbon atom is not bonded to the maximum (four) other atoms. Therefore, it 
is possible for another atom or group of atoms to become attached to the original mol-ecule. Furthermore, for a saturated hydrocarbon, all bonds are single ones, and no new 
atoms may be joined without the removal of others that are already bonded. Some of the simple hydrocarbons belong to the paraffin family; the chainlike par-affin molecules include methane (CH
4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane 
(C4H10). Compositions and molecular structures for paraffin molecules are contained 
in Table 14.1. The covalent bonds in each molecule are strong, but only weak hydrogen and van der Waals bonds exist between molecules, and thus these hydrocarbons have relatively low melting and boiling points. However, boiling temperatures rise with increasing molecular weight (Table 14.1).unsaturated

1In the hybrid bonding scheme for carbon (Section 2.6), a carbon atom forms sp3 hybrid orbitals when all its bonds are single 
ones; a carbon atom with a double bond has sp2 hybrid orbitals; and a carbon atom with a triple bond has sp hybridization.Table 14.1

Consider again the hydrocarbon ethylene (C2H4), which is a gas at ambient temperature 
and pressure and has the following molecular structure:
CHH

 If the ethylene gas is reacted under appropriate conditions, it will transform to poly-
ethylene (PE), which is a solid polymeric material. This process begins when an active center is formed by the reaction between an initiator or catalyst species ( R.) and the 
ethylene monomer, as follows:

R·C · (14.1)14.4 THE CHEMISTRY OF POLYMER MOLECULESThe molecules in polymers are gigantic in comparison to the hydrocarbon molecules 
already discussed; because of their size they are often referred to as macromolecules. 
Within each molecule, the atoms are bound together by covalent interatomic bonds. For carbon-chain polymers, the backbone of each chain is a string of carbon atoms. Many times each carbon atom singly bonds to two adjacent carbon atoms on either side, rep-resented schematically in two dimensions as follows:
C C C C C C C
Each of the two remaining valence electrons for every carbon atom may be involved in side bonding with atoms or radicals that are positioned adjacent to the chain. Of course, both chain and side double bonds are also possible. These long molecules are composed of structural entities called repeat units, 
which are successively repeated along the chain.
2 The term monomer refers to the small 
molecule from which a polymer is synthesized. Hence, monomer and repeat unit mean 
different things, but sometimes the term monomer or monomer unit is used instead of 
the more proper term repeat unit.macromolecule

monomer14.3 POLYMER MOLECULES
2A repeat unit is also sometimes called a mer. Mer originates from the Greek word meros, 
which means “part”; the term polymer was coined to mean “many mers.” polymer There are numerous other organic groups, many of which are involved in polymer 
structures. Several of the more common groups are presented in Table 14.2, where R and R′ represent organic groups such as CH
3, C2H5, and C6H5 (methyl, ethyl, and phenyl).

The polymer chain then forms by the sequential addition of monomer units to this 
actively growing chain molecule. The active site, or unpaired electron (denoted by ·), 
is transferred to each successive end monomer as it is linked to the chain. This may be represented schematically as follows:

The final result, after the addition of many ethylene monomer units, is the polyethylene

number of times it repeats.4
 The representation in Figure 14.1a is not strictly correct, in that the angle between 
the singly bonded carbon atoms is not 180° as shown, but rather is close to 109°. A more accurate three-dimensional model is one in which the carbon atoms form a zigzag pat-tern (Figure 14.1b), the C ―C bond length being 0.154 nm. In this discussion, depiction 
of polymer molecules is frequently simplified using the linear chain model shown in Figure 14.1a.   : VMSE

in which one of the four H atoms is replaced with a Cl atom. Its polymerization is rep-resented as

where the R depicts either an atom [i.e., H or Cl, for polyethylene or poly(vinyl chlo-
ride), respectively] or an organic group such as CH3, C2H5, and C6H5 (methyl, ethyl, and 
phenyl). For example, when R represents a CH3 group, the polymer is polypropylene 
(PP). Poly(vinyl chloride) and polypropylene chain structures are also represented in Figure 14.2. Table 14.3 lists repeat units for some of the more common polymers; as may be noted, some of them—for example, nylon, polyester, and polycarbonate—are relatively complex. Repeat units for a large number of relatively common polymers are given in Appendix D. When all of the repeating units along a chain are of the same type, the resulting polymer is called a homopolymer. Chains may be composed of two or more different 
repeat units, in what are termed copolymers (see Section 14.10).
 The monomers discussed thus far have an active bond that may react to form two covalent bonds with other monomers forming a two-dimensional chainlike molecular structure, as indicated earlier for ethylene. Such a monomer is termed bifunctional.  In 
general, the functionality is the number of bonds that a given monomer can form. For 
example, monomers such as phenol–formaldehyde (Table 14.3) are trifunctional; they have three active bonds, from which a three-dimensional molecular network structure 
results.   : VMSE

14.5 Molecular Weight  •   487
Extremely large molecular weights5 are observed in polymers with very long chains. 
During the polymerization process, not all polymer chains will grow to the same length; 
this results in a distribution of chain lengths or molecular weights. Ordinarily, an aver-age molecular weight is specified, which may be determined by the measurement of various physical properties such as viscosity and osmotic pressure. There are several ways of defining average molecular weight. The number-average molecular weight M
n is obtained by dividing the chains into a series of size ranges and 14.5 MOLECULAR WEIGHT
5Molecular mass, molar mass, and relative molecular mass are sometimes used and are really more appropriate terms 
than molecular weight in the context of the present discussion—in actual fact, we are dealing with masses and not weights. 
However, molecular weight is most commonly found in the polymer literature and thus is used throughout this book.Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)

The number-average molecular weight is expressed as
 Mn=ΣxiMi (14.5a)
where Mi represents the mean (middle) molecular weight of size range i, and xi is the 
fraction of the total number of chains within the corresponding size range.
 A weight-average molecular weight Mw is based on the weight fraction of molecules 
within the various size ranges (Figure 14.3 b). It is calculated according to
 Mw =ΣwiMi (14.5b)
where, again, Mi is the mean molecular weight within a size range, whereas wi denotes 
the weight fraction of molecules within the same size interval. Computations for both number-average and weight-average molecular weights are carried out in Example Problem 14.1.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 14.1
Computations of Average Molecular Weights and Degree of Polymerization
Assume that the molecular weight distributions shown in Figure 14.3 are for poly(vinyl chloride). 
For this material, compute (a) the number-average molecular weight, (b) the degree of poly-merization, and (c) the weight-average molecular weight.
Solution
(a) The data necessary for this computation, as taken from Figure 14.3 a, are presented in 
Table 14.4a. According to Equation 14.5a, summation of all the x
iMi products (from the 
right-hand column) yields the number-average molecular weight, which in this case is 
21,150 g/mol.
(b) To determine the degree of polymerization (Equation 14.6), it is first necessary to compute 
the repeat unit molecular weight. For PVC, each repeat unit consists of two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and a single chlorine atom (Table 14.3). Furthermore, the atomic weights of C, H, and Cl are, respectively, 12.01, 1.01, and 35.45 g/mol. Thus, for PVC,
 m=2(12.01 g∕ mol) +3(1.01 g∕ mol) +35.45 g∕ mol

 Many polymer properties are affected by the length of the polymer chains. For 
example, the melting or softening temperature increases with increasing molecular weight (for M
 up to about 100,000 g/mol). At room temperature, polymers with very 
short chains (having molecular weights on the order of 100 g/mol) will generally exist as liquids. Those with molecular weights of approximately 1000 g/mol are waxy solids (such as paraffin wax) and soft resins. Solid polymers (sometimes termed high poly-
mers), which are of prime interest here, commonly have molecular weights ranging between 10,000 and several million g/mol. Thus, the same polymer material can have quite different properties if it is produced with a different molecular weight. Other properties that depend on molecular weight include elastic modulus and strength (see Chapter 15).(c) Table 14.4b shows the data for the weight-average molecular weight, as taken from 
Figure 14.3b . The wiMi products for the size intervals are tabulated in the right-hand col-
umn. The sum of these products (Equation 14.5b) yields a value of 23,200 g/mol for Mw.

Previously, polymer molecules have been shown as linear chains, neglecting the zigzag 
arrangement of the backbone atoms (Figure 14.1 b). Single chain bonds are capable of 
rotating and bending in three dimensions. Consider the chain atoms in Figure 14.5 a; 
a third carbon atom may lie at any point on the cone of revolution and still subtend about a 109° angle with the bond between the other two atoms. A straight chain seg-ment results when successive chain atoms are positioned as in Figure 14.5 b. However, 
chain bending and twisting are possible when there is a rotation of the chain atoms into other positions, as illustrated in Figure 14.5 c.
6 Thus, a single chain molecule composed 14.6 MOLECULAR SHAPE

 elements on neighboring chain atoms.
14.6 Molecular Shape  •   491
of many chain atoms might assume a shape similar to that represented schematically in 
Figure 14.6, having a multitude of bends, twists, and kinks.7 Also indicated in this figure 
is the end-to-end distance of the polymer chain r; this distance is much smaller than the 
total chain length. Polymers consist of large numbers of molecular chains, each of which may bend, coil, and kink in the manner of Figure 14.6. This leads to extensive intertwining and entanglement of neighboring chain molecules, a situation similar to what is seen in a heavily tangled fishing line. These random coils and molecular entanglements are re-sponsible for a number of important characteristics of polymers, to include the large elastic extensions displayed by the rubber materials. Some of the mechanical and thermal characteristics of polymers are a function of the ability of chain segments to experience rotation in response to applied stresses or thermal vibrations. Rotational flexibility is dependent on repeat unit structure and chemistry. For example, the region of a chain segment that has a double bond (CC) is rotationally rigid. Also, introduction of a bulky or large side group of at-
oms restricts rotational movement. For example, polystyrene molecules, which have a phenyl side group (Table 14.3), are more resistant to rotational motion than are polyethylene chains.Figure 14.5  Schematic representations of how polymer chain shape is influenced by the positioning of backbone 
carbon atoms (gray circles). For (a), the rightmost atom may lie anywhere on the dashed circle and still subtend a

492  •   Chapter 14  /  Polymer Structures
The physical characteristics of a polymer depend not only on its molecular weight 
and shape, but also on differences in the structure of the molecular chains. Modern polymer synthesis techniques permit considerable control over various structural  possibilities. This section discusses several molecular structures including linear, branched, crosslinked, and network, in addition to various isomeric configurations.
Linear Polymers
Linear polymers are those in which the repeat units are joined together end to end in single chains. These long chains are flexible and may be thought of as a mass of “spaghetti,” as represented schematically in Figure 14.7a , where each circle represents a repeat unit. For 
linear polymers, there may be extensive van der Waals and hydrogen bonding between the chains. Some of the common polymers that form with linear structures are polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), nylon, and the fluorocarbons.
Branched Polymers
Polymers may be synthesized in which side-branch chains are connected to the main ones, as indicated schematically in Figure 14.7 b; these are fittingly called branched 
polymers. The branches, considered to be part of the main-chain molecule, may result 
from side reactions that occur during the synthesis of the polymer. The chain packing 
efficiency is reduced with the formation of side branches, which results in a lowering of the polymer density. Polymers that form linear structures may also be branched. For example, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is primarily a linear polymer, whereas low-density polyethylene (LDPE) contains short-chain branches.linear polymer

14.8 Molecular Configurations  •   493
Crosslinked Polymers
In crosslinked polymers, adjacent linear chains are joined one to another at various 
positions by covalent bonds, as represented in Figure 14.7 c. The process of crosslinking 
is achieved either during synthesis or by a nonreversible chemical reaction. Often, this 
crosslinking is accomplished by additive atoms or molecules that are covalently bonded to the chains. Many of the rubber elastic materials are crosslinked; in rubbers, this is called vulcanization, a process described in Section 15.9.
Network Polymers
Multifunctional monomers forming three or more active covalent bonds make three-dimensional networks (Figure 14.7d) and are termed network polymers. Actually, a 
polymer that is highly crosslinked may also be classified as a network polymer. These 
 materials have distinctive mechanical and thermal properties; the epoxies, poly-urethanes, and phenol-formaldehyde belong to this group.
 Polymers are not usually of only one distinctive structural type. For example, a 
predominantly linear polymer may have limited branching and crosslinking.crosslinked polymer
network polymer
For polymers having more than one side atom or group of atoms bonded to the main 
chain, the regularity and symmetry of the side group arrangement can significantly influ-ence the properties. Consider the repeat unit
CHH
HC
R
in which R represents an atom or side group other than hydrogen (e.g., Cl, CH3). One 
arrangement is possible when the R side groups of successive repeat units are bound to 
alternate carbon atoms as follows:
CHH
HC CHHH
C
R R
This is designated as a head-to-tail configuration.8 Its complement, the head-to-head 
configuration, occurs when R groups are bound to adjacent chain atoms:
CHHH
C CHH
HC
R R
In most polymers, the head-to-tail configuration predominates; often a polar repulsion 
occurs between R groups for the head-to-head configuration. Isomerism (Section 14.2) is also found in polymer molecules, wherein different atomic configurations are possible for the same composition. Two isomeric subclasses—stereoisomerism and geometric isomerism—are topics of discussion in the succeeding sections.14.8 MOLECULAR CONFIGURATIONS
8The term configuration is used in reference to arrangements of units along the axis of the chain, or atom positions 
that are not alterable except by the breaking and then re-forming of primary bonds.
494  •   Chapter 14  /  Polymer Structures
Stereoisomerism
Stereoisomerism denotes the situation in which atoms are linked together in the same 
order (head-to-tail) but differ in their spatial arrangement. For one stereoisomer, all of  
the R groups are situated on the same side of the chain as follows:
H R HH R R H R
HH HHHH HHCCCCC
C C C CH R
This is called an isotactic configuration. This diagram shows the zigzag pattern of the 
carbon chain atoms. Furthermore, representation of the structural geometry in three di-mensions is important, as indicated by the wedge-shaped bonds; solid wedges represent bonds that project out of the plane of the page, and dashed ones represent bonds that project into the page.

 Conversion from one stereoisomer to another (e.g., isotactic to syndiotactic) is 
not possible by a simple rotation about single-chain bonds. These bonds must first be  severed; then, after the appropriate rotation, they are re-formed. In reality, a specific polymer does not exhibit just one of these configurations; the predominant form depends on the method of synthesis.
Geometric Isomerism
Other important chain configurations, or geometric isomers, are possible within re-peat units having a double bond between chain carbon atoms. Bonded to each of the carbon atoms participating in the double bond is a side group, which may be situated on one  side of the chain or its opposite. Consider the isoprene repeat unit having the structure
CH3
CH2 CH2CCH
in which the CH3 group and the H atom are positioned on the same side of the double 
bond. This is termed a cis structure, and the resulting polymer, cis-polyisoprene, is natural  
rubber. For the alternative isomer

the trans structure, the CH3 and H reside on opposite sides of the double bond.12 Trans-
polyisoprene, sometimes called gutta percha, has properties that are distinctly different from those of natural rubber as a result of this configurational alteration. Conversion of trans to cis, or vice versa, is not possible by a simple chain bond rotation because the 
chain double bond is extremely rigid.

of molecular weight (or degree of polymerization). Molecular shape relates to the 
degree of chain twisting, coiling, and bending. Molecular structure depends on the manner in which structural units are joined together. Linear, branched, crosslinked, and network structures are all possible, in addition to several isomeric configura-tions (isotactic, syndiotactic, atactic, cis, and trans). These molecular characteristics are presented in the taxonomic chart shown in Figure 14.8. Note that some of the structural elements are not mutually exclusive, and it may be necessary to specify molecular structure in terms of more than one.

The response of a polymer to mechanical forces at elevated temperatures is related to 
its dominant molecular structure. In fact, one classification scheme for these materi-als is according to behavior with rising temperature. Thermoplastics (or  thermoplastic 
polymers) and thermosets (or thermosetting polymers) are the two subdivisions. thermoplastic  
 polymer
thermosetting 
 polymer14.9 THERMOPLASTIC AND THERMOSETTING POLYMERS
14.10 Copolymers  •   497
Thermoplastics soften when heated (and eventually liquefy) and harden when cooled—
processes that are totally reversible and may be repeated. On a molecular level, as the temperature is raised, secondary bonding forces are diminished (by increased molecular motion) so that the relative movement of adjacent chains is facilitated when a stress is applied. Irreversible degradation results when a molten thermoplastic polymer is raised to too high a temperature. In addition, thermoplastics are relatively soft. Most linear polymers and those having some branched structures with flexible chains are thermo-plastic. These materials are normally fabricated by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure (see Section 15.23). Examples of common thermoplastic polymers include polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(vinyl chloride). Thermosetting polymers are network polymers. They become permanently hard during their formation and do not soften upon heating. Network polymers have cova-lent crosslinks between adjacent molecular chains. During heat treatments, these bonds anchor the chains together to resist the vibrational and rotational chain motions at high temperatures. Thus, the materials do not soften when heated. Crosslinking is usually extensive, in that 10% to 50% of the chain repeat units are crosslinked. Only heating to excessive temperatures will cause severance of these crosslink bonds and polymer degradation. Thermoset polymers are generally harder and stronger than thermoplastics and have better dimensional stability. Most of the crosslinked and network polymers, which include vulcanized rubbers, epoxies, phenolics, and some polyester resins, are thermosetting.

or thermosetting. Suggest one reason for this.

Polymer chemists and scientists are continually searching for new materials that can be 
easily and economically synthesized and fabricated with improved properties or better property combinations than are offered by the homopolymers previously discussed. One group of these materials are the copolymers. Consider a copolymer that is composed of two repeat units as represented by 
 and 
 in Figure 14.9. Depending on the polymerization process and the relative fractions 
of these repeat unit types, different sequencing arrangements along the polymer chains are possible. For one, as depicted in Figure 14.9 a, the two different units are randomly 
dispersed along the chain in what is termed a random copolymer. For an alternating 
copolymer, as the name suggests, the two repeat units alternate chain positions, as 
 illustrated in Figure 14.9b. A block copolymer is one in which identical repeat units are 
clustered in blocks along the chain (Figure 14.9 c). Finally, homopolymer side branches 
of one type may be grafted to homopolymer main chains that are composed of a differ-
ent repeat unit; such a material is termed a graft copolymer (Figure 14.9d).
 When calculating the degree of polymerization for a copolymer, the value m in 
Equation 14.6 is replaced with the average value m
 that is determined from

 Synthetic rubbers, discussed in Section 15.16, are often copolymers; chemical repeat 
units that are employed in some of these rubbers are shown in Table 14.5. Styrene– butadiene rubber (SBR) is a common random copolymer from which automobile tires are made. Nitrile rubber (NBR) is another random copolymer composed of acrylonitrile and butadiene. It is also highly elastic and, in addition, resistant to swelling in organic solvents; gasoline hoses are made of NBR. Impact-modified polystyrene is a block copolymer that consists of alternating blocks of styrene and butadiene. The rubbery isoprene blocks act to slow cracks propagating through the material.(a)

The crystalline state may exist in polymeric materials. However, because it involves 
molecules instead of just atoms or ions, as with metals and ceramics, the atomic  arrangements will be more complex for polymers. We think of polymer crystallinity as 
the packing of molecular chains to produce an ordered atomic array. Crystal structures may be specified in terms of unit cells, which are often quite complex. For example, Figure 14.10 shows the unit cell for polyethylene and its relationship to the molecular chain structure; this unit cell has orthorhombic geometry (Table 3.2). Of course, the chain molecules also extend beyond the unit cell shown in the figure.polymer crystallinity14.11 POLYMER CRYSTALLINITY

500  •   Chapter 14  /  Polymer Structures
 Molecular substances having small molecules (e.g., water and methane) are nor-
mally either totally crystalline (as solids) or totally amorphous (as liquids). As a conse-quence of their size and often complexity, polymer molecules are often only partially crystalline (or semicrystalline), having crystalline regions dispersed within the remaining amorphous material. Any chain disorder or misalignment will result in an amorphous region, a condition that is fairly common, because twisting, kinking, and coiling of the chains prevent the strict ordering of every segment of every chain. Other structural ef-fects are also influential in determining the extent of crystallinity, as discussed shortly. The degree of crystallinity may range from completely amorphous to almost entirely (up to about 95%) crystalline; in contrast, metal specimens are almost always entirely crystalline, whereas many ceramics are either totally crystalline or totally noncrystalline. Semicrystalline polymers are, in a sense, analogous to two-phase metal alloys, discussed previously. The density of a crystalline polymer will be greater than an amorphous one of the same material and molecular weight because the chains are more closely packed together for the crystalline structure. The degree of crystallinity by weight may be  determined from accurate density measurements, according to
 
% crystallinity =𝜌c(𝜌s−𝜌a)
𝜌s(𝜌c−𝜌a)×100  (14.8)
where 𝜌s is the density of a specimen for which the percent crystallinity is to be de-
termined, 𝜌a is the density of the totally amorphous polymer, and 𝜌c is the density of 
the perfectly crystalline polymer. The values of 𝜌a and 𝜌c must be measured by other 
experimental means.
 The degree of crystallinity of a polymer depends on the rate of cooling during solidification as well as on the chain configuration. During crystallization upon cooling through the melting temperature, the chains, which are highly random and entangled in the viscous liquid, must assume an ordered configuration. For this to occur, sufficient time must be allowed for the chains to move and align themselves. The molecular chemistry as well as chain configuration also influence the ability of a polymer to crystallize. Crystallization is not favored in polymers that are composed of chemically complex repeat units (e.g., polyisoprene). However, crystallization is not eas-ily prevented in chemically simple polymers such as polyethylene and polytetrafluoro-ethylene, even for very rapid cooling rates. For linear polymers, crystallization is easily accomplished because there are few restric-tions to prevent chain alignment. Any side branches interfere with crystallization, such that branched polymers never are highly crystalline; in fact, excessive branching may prevent any crystallization whatsoever. Most network and crosslinked polymers are almost totally amorphous because the crosslinks prevent the polymer chains from rearranging and aligning into a crystalline structure. A few crosslinked polymers are partially crystalline. With regard to the stereoisomers, atactic polymers are difficult to crystallize; however, isotactic and syn-diotactic polymers crystallize much more easily because the regularity of the geometry of the side groups facilitates the process of fitting together adjacent chains. Also, the bulkier or larger the side-bonded groups of atoms, the less is the tendency for crystallization. For copolymers, as a general rule, the more irregular and random the repeat unit arrangements, the greater is the tendency for the development of noncrystallinity. For alternating and block copolymers there is some likelihood of crystallization. However, random and graft copolymers are normally amorphous. To some extent, the physical properties of polymeric materials are influenced by the degree of crystallinity. Crystalline polymers are usually stronger and more resistant to disso-lution and softening by heat. Some of these properties are discussed in subsequent chapters.Percent

(a) Equation 3.8, used in Chapter 3 to determine densities for metals, also applies to polymeric 
materials and is used to solve this problem. It takes the same form, namely,

VC NA
 where n represents the number of repeat units within the unit cell (for polyethylene n  = 2), 
and A is the repeat unit molecular weight, which for polyethylene is
 A=2(AC)+4(AH)
 =(2)(12.01 g∕ mol) +(4)(1.008 g∕ mol) =28.05 g∕ mol
 Also, VC is the unit cell volume, which is just the product of the three unit cell edge lengths 
in Figure 14.10; or
 VC =(0.741 nm)(0.494 nm)(0.255 nm)
 =(7.41 ×10−8 cm)(4.94 ×10−8 cm)(2.55 ×10−8 cm)

 Now, substitution into Equation 3.8 of this value, values for n and A cited previously, and 
the value of NA leads to

with 𝜌c = 0.998 g/cm3, 𝜌a = 0.870 g/cm3, and 𝜌s = 0.925 g/cm3. Thus,

(crystallites), each having a precise alignment, which are interspersed with amorphous 
regions composed of randomly oriented molecules. The structure of the crystalline re-
gions may be deduced by examination of polymer single crystals, which may be grown from dilute solutions. These crystals are regularly shaped, thin platelets (or lamellae) 
approximately 10 to 20 nm thick, and on the order of 10 μm long. Frequently, these 
platelets form a multilayered structure, like that shown in the electron micrograph of a single crystal of polyethylene in Figure 14.11. The molecular chains within each platelet fold back and forth on themselves, with folds occurring at the faces; this structure, aptly termed the chain-folded model, is illustrated schematically in Figure 14.12. Each platelet 
consists of a number of molecules; however, the average chain length is much greater than the thickness of the platelet. Many bulk polymers that are crystallized from a melt are semicrystalline and form a spherulite structure. As implied by the name, each spherulite may grow to be roughly 
spherical in shape; one of them, as found in natural rubber, is shown in the transmission crystallite

electron micrograph in the margin photograph on this page [and the chapter-opening 
photograph (d) for this chapter]. The spherulite consists of an aggregate of ribbonlike chain-folded crystallites (lamellae)  approximately 10 nm thick that radiate outward from a single nucleation site in the center. In this electron micrograph, these lamellae appear as thin white lines. The  detailed structure of a spherulite is illustrated schemati-cally in Figure 14.13. Shown here are the individual chain-folded lamellar crystals that are separated by amorphous material. Tie-chain molecules that act as connecting links between adjacent lamellae pass through these amorphous regions. As the crystallization of a spherulitic structure nears completion, the extremities of adjacent spherulites begin to impinge on one another, forming more or less planar boundaries; prior to this time, they maintain their spherical shape. These boundaries are evident in Figure 14.14, which is a photomicrograph of polyethylene using cross-polarized light. A characteristic Maltese cross pattern appears within each spherulite. The bands or rings in the spherulite image result from twisting of the lamellar crystals as they extend like ribbons from the center. Spherulites are considered to be the polymer analogue of grains in polycrystalline metals and ceramics. However, as discussed earlier, each spherulite is really  composed of many different lamellar crystals and, in addition, some amorphous material. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polytetrafluoroethylene, and nylon form a spherulitic structure when they crystallize from a melt.

The point defect concept is different in polymers than in metals (Section 4.2) and ceram-
ics (Section 12.5) as a consequence of the chainlike macromolecules and the nature of the crystalline state for polymers. Point defects similar to those found in metals have been observed in crystalline regions of polymeric materials; these include vacancies and interstitial atoms and ions. Chain ends are considered defects because they are chemi-cally dissimilar to normal chain units. Vacancies are also associated with the chain ends (Figure 14.15). However, additional defects can result from branches in the polymer chain or chain segments that emerge from the crystal. A chain section can leave a poly-mer crystal and reenter it at another point, creating a loop, or can enter a second crystal to act as a tie molecule (see Figure 14.13). Screw dislocations also occur in polymer crys-tals (Figure 14.15). Impurity atoms/ions or groups of atoms/ions may be incorporated in 14.13 DEFECTS IN POLYMERS

the molecular structure as interstitials; they may also be associated with main chains or 
as short side branches. Furthermore, the surfaces of chain-folded layers (Figure 14.13) are considered  interfacial defects, as are also boundaries between two adjacent crystalline regions.
For polymeric materials, our interest is often in the diffusive motion of small foreign molecules (e.g., O
2, H2O, CO2, CH4) between the molecular chains rather than in the 
diffusive motion of chain atoms within the polymer structure. A polymer’s permeability and absorption characteristics relate to the degree to which foreign substances diffuse into the material. Penetration of these foreign substances can lead to swelling and/or chemical reactions with the polymer molecules and often a degradation of the material’s mechanical and physical properties (Section 17.11). Rates of diffusion are greater through amorphous regions than through crystalline regions; the structure of amorphous material is more “open.” This diffusion mechanism may be considered analogous to interstitial diffusion in metals—that is, in polymers, diffusive movements occur through small voids between polymer chains from one open amorphous region to an adjacent open one. Foreign molecule size also affects the diffusion rate: Smaller molecules diffuse faster than larger ones. Furthermore, diffusion is more rapid for foreign molecules that are chemically inert than for those that interact with the polymer. One step in diffusion through a polymer membrane is the dissolution of the molecu-lar species in the membrane material. This dissolution is a time-dependent process, and, if slower than the diffusive motion, may limit the overall rate of diffusion. Consequently, the diffusion properties of polymers are often characterized in terms of a permeability 
coefficient (denoted by P
M), where for the case of steady-state diffusion through a poly-
mer membrane, Fick’s first law (Equation 5.2), is modified as
 J=−PM ΔP
Δx (14.9)
In this expression, J  is the diffusion flux of gas through the membrane [(cm3 STP)/
(cm2·s)], PM is the permeability coefficient, Δx is the membrane thickness, and ΔP 
is the difference in pressure of the gas across the membrane. For small molecules in 
nonglassy polymers the permeability coefficient can be approximated as the product of the diffusion coefficient (D ) and solubility of the diffusing species in the polymer 
(S)—that is,
 P
M=DS (14.10)
Table 14.6 presents the permeability coefficients of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor in several common polymers.
13
 For some applications, low permeability rates through polymeric materials are desirable, as with food and beverage packaging and automobile tires and inner tubes. 14.14 DIFFUSION IN POLYMERIC MATERIALS
13 The units for permeability coefficients in Table 14.6 are unusual and are explained as follows: When the diffusing 
molecular  species is in the gas phase, solubility is equal to
S=C
P
where C  is the concentration of the diffusing species in the polymer [in units of (cm3 STP gas)/cm3 polymer] and 
P is the partial pressure (in units of Pa). STP indicates that this is the volume of gas at standard temperature and 
pressure [273 K (0° C) and 101.3 kPa (1 atm)]. Thus, the units for S  are (cm3 STP)/Pa ·cm3. Because D  is expressed 
in terms of cm2/s, the units for the permeability coefficient are (cm3 STP)(cm)/(cm2·s·Pa).

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 14.3
Computations of Diffusion Flux of Carbon Dioxide through 
a Plastic Beverage Container and Beverage Shelf Life
The clear plastic bottles used for carbonated beverages (sometimes also called  soda, pop, or 
soda pop) are made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The “fizz” in pop results from 
dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2); because PET is permeable to CO2, pop stored in PET bottles 
will eventually go “flat” (i.e., lose its fizz). A 20-oz. bottle of pop has a CO2 pressure of about 
400 kPa inside the bottle, and the CO2 pressure outside the bottle is 0.4 kPa.
(a) Assuming conditions of steady state, calculate the diffusion flux of CO2 through the wall of 
the bottle.
(b) If the bottle must lose 750 (cm3 STP) of CO2 before the pop tastes flat, what is the shelf life 
for a bottle of pop?
Note: Assume that each bottle has a surface area of 500 cm2 and a wall thickness of 0.05 cm.
Solution
(a) This is a permeability problem in which Equation 14.9 is employed. The permeability 
 coefficient of CO2 through PET (Table 14.6) is 0.23 × 10−13 (cm3 STP)(cm)/(cm2·s·Pa).

SUMMARY
• Most polymeric materials are composed of very large molecular chains with side 
groups of various atoms (O, Cl, etc.) or organic groups such as methyl, ethyl, or  phenyl 
groups.
• These macromolecules are composed of repeat units, smaller structural entities, 
which are repeated along the chain.Polymer Molecules
• Repeat units for some of the chemically simple polymers [polyethylene, polytetra-
fluoroethylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polypropylene, etc.] are presented in Table 14.3.
• A homopolymer is one for which all of the repeat units are the same type. The chains 
for copolymers are composed of two or more kinds of repeat units.
• Repeat units are classified according to the number of active bonds (i.e., functionality):
For bifunctional monomers, a two-dimensional chainlike structure results from a 
monomer that has two active bonds.
Trifunctional monomers have three active bonds, from which three-dimensional 
network structures form.The Chemistry of 
Polymer Molecules
• Molecular weights for high polymers may be in excess of a million. Because all mol-
ecules are not of the same size, there is a distribution of molecular weights.
• Molecular weight is often expressed in terms of number and weight averages; values 
for these parameters may be determined using Equations 14.5a and 14.5b, respectively.
• Chain length may also be specified by degree of polymerization—the number of re-
peat units per average molecule (Equation 14.6).Molecular Weight
• Molecular entanglements occur when the chains assume twisted, coiled, and kinked 
shapes or contours as a consequence of chain bond rotations.
• Rotational flexibility is diminished when double chain bonds are present and also 
when bulky side groups are part of the repeat unit.Molecular Shape
• Four different polymer molecular chain structures are possible: linear (Figure 14.7a), 
branched (Figure 14.7b), crosslinked (Figure 14.7c), and network (Figure 14.7d).Molecular Structure
508  •   Chapter 14  /  Polymer Structures
• For repeat units that have more than one side atom or groups of atoms bonded to the 
main chain:
Head-to-head and head-to-tail configurations are possible.
Differences in spatial arrangements of these side atoms or groups of atoms lead 
to isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic stereoisomers.
• When a repeat unit contains a double chain bond, both cis and trans geometric 
 isomers are possible.
• With regard to behavior at elevated temperatures, polymers are classified as either 
thermoplastic or thermosetting.
Thermoplastic polymers have linear and branched structures; they soften when 
heated and harden when cooled.
In contrast, thermosetting polymers, once they have hardened, will not soften 
upon heating; their structures are crosslinked and network.Molecular 
Configurations
• The copolymers include random (Figure 14.9a), alternating (Figure 14.9b), block 
(Figure 14.9c), and graft (Figure 14.9 d) types.Copolymers
• When the molecular chains are aligned and packed in an ordered atomic arrange-
ment, the condition of crystallinity is said to exist.
• Amorphous polymers are also possible wherein the chains are misaligned and 
 disordered.
• In addition to being entirely amorphous, polymers may also exhibit varying degrees 
of crystallinity—that is, crystalline regions are interdispersed within amorphous areas.
• Crystallinity is facilitated for polymers that are chemically simple and that have regu-
lar and symmetrical chain structures.
• The percent crystallinity of a semicrystalline polymer is dependent on its density, as 
well as the densities of the totally crystalline and totally amorphous materials, accord-ing to Equation 14.8.Polymer Crystallinity
• Crystalline regions (or crystallites) are plate-shape and have a chain-folded structure 
(Figure 14.12)—chains within the platelet are aligned and fold back and forth on themselves, with folds occurring at the faces.
• Many semicrystalline polymers form spherulites; each spherulite consists of a col-
lection of ribbonlike chain-folded lamellar crystallites that radiate outward from its center.Polymer Crystals
• Although the point defect concept in polymers is different than in metals and ceram-
ics, vacancies, interstitial atoms, and impurity atoms/ions and groups of atoms/ions as interstitials have been found to exist in crystalline regions.
• Other defects include chain ends, dangling and loose chains, and dislocations (Figure 
14.15).Defects in Polymers
• With regard to diffusion in polymers, small molecules of foreign substances diffuse 
between molecular chains by an interstitial-type mechanism from one void to an  adjacent one.Diffusion in

Mechanical Behavior of Polymers
The mechanical properties of polymers are specified with many of the same parameters that are used for metals—that is, modulus of elasticity and yield and tensile strengths. For many polymeric materials, the simple stress–strain test is used to characterize some of these mechanical parameters.
1 The mechanical characteristics of polymers, for the 
most part, are highly sensitive to the rate of deformation (strain rate), the temperature, and the chemical nature of the environment (the presence of water, oxygen, organic sol-vents, etc.). Some modifications of the testing techniques and specimen configurations used for metals (Chapter 6) are necessary with polymers, especially for highly elastic materials, such as rubbers.15.2 STRESS–STRAIN BEHAVIOR
1ASTM Standard D638, “Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics.”There are several reasons why an engineer should know 
something about the characteristics, applications, and processing of polymeric materials. Polymers are used in a wide variety of applications, such as construction materi-als and microelectronics processing. Thus, most engineers will be required to work with polymers at some point in their careers. Understanding the mechanisms by which polymers elastically and plastically deform allows one to 
alter and control their moduli of elasticity and strengths (Sections 15.7 and 15.8). Also, additives may be incorporated into polymeric materials to modify a host of properties, including strength, abrasion resistance, toughness, thermal stability, stiffness, deteriorability, color, and flammability resistance (Section 15.22).
512  •   
15.2 Stress–Strain Behavior  •   513
 Three typically different types of stress–strain behavior are found for polymeric ma-
terials, as represented in Figure 15.1. Curve A  illustrates the stress–strain character for 
a brittle polymer, which fractures while deforming elastically. The behavior for a plastic material, curve B, is similar to that for many metallic materials; the initial deformation 
is elastic, which is followed by yielding and a region of plastic deformation. Finally, the deformation displayed by curve C is totally elastic; this rubberlike elasticity (large recov-
erable strains produced at low stress levels) is displayed by a class of polymers termed the elastomers.
 Modulus of elasticity (termed tensile modulus or sometimes just modulus for poly-mers) and ductility in percent elongation are determined for polymers in the same manner as for metals (Sections 6.3 and 6.6). For plastic polymers (curve B , Figure 15.1), the yield 
point is taken as a maximum on the curve, which occurs just beyond the termination of the linear-elastic region (Figure 15.2). The stress at this maximum is the yield strength (𝜎
y). 
Tensile strength (TS) corresponds to the stress at which fracture occurs (Figure 15.2); TS 
may be greater than or less than 𝜎y. For these plastic polymers, strength is normally taken 
as tensile strength. Table 15.1 gives these mechanical properties for several polymeric materials; more comprehensive lists are provided in Tables B.2 to B.4, Appendix B. In many respects, polymers are mechanically dissimilar to metals (Figures 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7). For example, the modulus for highly elastic polymeric materials may be as low as 7 MPa (10
3 psi), but it may run as high as 4 GPa (0.6 × 106 psi) for some very 
stiff polymers; modulus values for metals are much larger and range between 48 and 410 GPa (7 × 10
6 to 60 × 106 psi). Maximum tensile strengths for polymers are about 
100 MPa (15,000 psi), whereas for some metal alloys they are 4100 MPa (600,000 psi). Furthermore, whereas metals rarely elongate plastically to more than 100%, some highly elastic polymers may experience elongations to greater than 1000%. In addition, the mechanical characteristics of polymers are much more sensitive to temperature changes near room temperature. Consider the stress–strain behavior for poly(methyl methacrylate) (Plexiglas) at several temperatures between 4 °C and 60° C 
(40°F and 140° F) (Figure 15.3). Increasing the temperature produces (1) a decrease in 
elastic modulus, (2) a reduction in tensile strength, and (3) an enhancement of ductility—at 4°C (40° F) the material is totally brittle, whereas there is considerable plastic deformation 
at both 50° C and 60° C (122° F and 140° F).   : VMSE

general, decreasing the rate of deformation has the same influence on the stress–strain characteristics as increasing the temperature; that is, the material becomes softer and more ductile.

An amorphous polymer may behave like a glass at low temperatures, a rubbery solid 
at intermediate temperatures [above the glass transition temperature (Section 15.12)], and a viscous liquid as the temperature is further raised. For relatively small deforma-tions, the mechanical behavior at low temperatures may be elastic—that is, in conform-ity to Hooke’s law, 𝜎 = E𝜀. At the highest temperatures, viscous or liquidlike behavior 
prevails. For intermediate temperatures, the polymer is a rubbery solid that exhibits the combined mechanical characteristics of these two extremes; the condition is termed 
viscoelasticity. Elastic deformation is instantaneous, which means that total deformation (or strain) 
occurs the instant the stress is applied or released (i.e., the strain is independent of time). 
viscoelasticity15.4 VISCOELASTIC DEFORMATIONSome aspects of the macroscopic deformation of semicrystalline polymers deserve our attention. The tensile stress–strain curve for a semicrystalline material that was initially undeformed is shown in Figure 15.4; also included in the figure are schematic represen-tations of the specimen profiles at various stages of deformation. Both upper and lower yield points are evident on the curve, which are followed by a near horizontal region. At the upper yield point, a small neck forms within the gauge section of the specimen. Within this neck, the chains become oriented (i.e., chain axes become aligned parallel to the elongation direction, a condition that is represented schematically in Figure 15.13d), which leads to localized strengthening. Consequently, there is a resistance to continued deformation at this point, and specimen elongation proceeds by the propagation of this neck region along the gauge length; the chain orientation phenomenon (Figure 15.13 d) 
accompanies this neck extension. This tensile behavior may be contrasted to that found for ductile metals (Section 6.6), in which once a neck has formed, all subsequent defor-mation is confined to within the neck region.

In addition, upon release of the external stress, the deformation is totally recovered—the 
specimen assumes its original dimensions. This behavior is represented in Figure 15.5 b 
as strain versus time for the instantaneous load–time curve, shown in Figure 15.5 a.
 By way of contrast, for totally viscous behavior, deformation or strain is not instan-taneous; that is, in response to an applied stress, deformation is delayed or dependent on time. Also, this deformation is not reversible or completely recovered after the stress is released. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 15.5 d.
 For the intermediate viscoelastic behavior, the imposition of a stress in the manner of Figure 15.5a results in an instantaneous elastic strain, which is followed by a viscous, time-dependent strain, a form of anelasticity (Section 6.4); this behavior is illustrated in Figure 15.5c. A familiar example of these viscoelastic extremes is found in a silicone polymer that is sold as a novelty and known by some as Silly Putty. When rolled into a ball and dropped onto a horizontal surface, it bounces elastically—the rate of deformation during the bounce is very rapid. However, if pulled in tension with a gradually increasing applied stress, the material elongates or flows like a highly viscous liquid. For this and other viscoelastic ma-terials, the rate of strain determines whether the deformation is elastic or viscous.
Viscoelastic Relaxation Modulus
The viscoelastic behavior of polymeric materials is dependent on both time and tem-perature; several experimental techniques may be used to measure and quantify this behavior. Stress relaxation measurements represent one possibility. With these tests, a 
specimen is initially strained rapidly in tension to a predetermined and relatively low strain level. The stress necessary to maintain this strain is measured as a function of time while temperature is held constant. Stress is found to decrease with time because of molecular relaxation processes that take place within the polymer. We may define a 
relaxation modulus E
r(t), a time-dependent elastic modulus for viscoelastic polymers, as
 Er(t)=𝜎(t)
𝜀0 (15.1)
where 𝜎(t) is the measured time-dependent stress and 𝜀0 is the strain level, which is 
maintained constant.relaxation modulus

 Furthermore, the magnitude of the relaxation modulus is a function of temperature; to 
more fully characterize the viscoelastic behavior of a polymer, isothermal stress relaxation measurements must be conducted over a range of temperatures. Figure 15.6 is a schematic log E
r(t)-versus-log time plot for a polymer that exhibits viscoelastic behavior. Curves gen-
erated at a variety of temperatures are included. Key features of this plot are that (1) the magnitude of E
r(t) decreases with time (corresponding to the decay of stress, Equation 15.1), 
and (2) the curves are displaced to lower Er(t) levels with increasing temperature.
 To represent the influence of temperature, data points are taken at a specific time from the log E
r(t)-versus-log time plot—for example, t1 in Figure 15.6—and then cross-plotted as 
log Er(t1) versus temperature. Figure 15.7 is such a plot for an amorphous (atactic) poly-
styrene; in this case, t1 was arbitrarily taken 10 s after the load application. Several distinct 
regions may be noted on the curve shown in this figure. At the lowest temperatures, in the glassy region, the material is rigid and brittle, and the value of E
r(10) is that of the elastic 
modulus, which initially is virtually independent of temperature. Over this temperature range, the strain–time characteristics are as represented in Figure 15.5 b. On a molecular 
level, the long molecular chains are essentially frozen in position at these temperatures. As the temperature is increased, E
r(10) drops abruptly by about a factor of 103 
within a 20°C (35°F) temperature span; this is sometimes called the leathery, or glass Figure 15.6  Schematic plot of logarithm

transition region, and the glass transition temperature (Tg, Section 15.13) lies near the 
upper temperature extremity; for polystyrene (Figure 15.7), Tg = 100°C (212°F). Within 
this temperature region, a polymer specimen will be leathery; that is, deformation will 
be time dependent and not totally recoverable on release of an applied load, character-istics that are depicted in Figure 15.5 c.
 Within the rubbery plateau temperature region (Figure 15.7), the material deforms in a rubbery manner; here, both elastic and viscous components are present, and defor-mation is easy to produce because the relaxation modulus is relatively low. The final two high-temperature regions are rubbery flow and viscous flow. Upon heat-ing through these temperatures, the material experiences a gradual transition to a soft, rub-bery state, and finally to a viscous liquid. In the rubbery flow region, the polymer is a very viscous liquid that exhibits both elastic and viscous flow components. Within the viscous flow region, the modulus decreases dramatically with increasing temperature; again, the strain–time behavior is as represented in Figure 15.5d . From a molecular standpoint, chain 
motion intensifies so greatly that for viscous flow, the chain segments experience vibration and rotational motion largely independent of one another. At these temperatures, any deformation is entirely viscous and essentially no elastic behavior occurs. Normally, the deformation behavior of a viscous polymer is specified in terms of vis-cosity, a measure of a material’s resistance to flow by shear forces. Viscosity is discussed for the inorganic glasses in Section 12.10. The rate of stress application also influences the viscoelastic characteristics. Increasing the loading rate has the same influence as lowering the temperature. The log E
r(10)-versus-temperature behavior for polystyrene materials having several 
molecular configurations is plotted in Figure 15.8. The curve for the amorphous material (curve C) is the same as in Figure 15.7. For a lightly crosslinked atactic polystyrene (curve B), 
the rubbery region forms a plateau that extends to the temperature at which the polymer decomposes; this material will not experience melting. For increased crosslinking, the mag-nitude of the plateau E
r(10) value will also increase. Rubber or elastomeric materials display 
this type of behavior and are ordinarily used at temperatures within this plateau range. Also shown in Figure 15.8 is the temperature dependence for an almost totally crystalline isotactic polystyrene (curve A). The decrease in E
r(10) at Tg is much less

pronounced than for the other polystyrene materials because only a small volume frac-
tion of this material is amorphous and experiences the glass transition. Furthermore, the relaxation modulus is maintained at a relatively high value with increasing temperature until its melting temperature T
m is approached. From Figure 15.8, the melting tempera-
ture of this isotactic polystyrene is about 240 °C (460°F).
Viscoelastic Creep
Many polymeric materials are susceptible to time-dependent deformation when the stress level is maintained constant; such deformation is termed viscoelastic creep. This 
type of deformation may be significant even at room temperature and under modest stresses that lie below the yield strength of the material. For example, automobile tires may develop flat spots on their contact surfaces when the automobile is parked for prolonged time periods. Creep tests on polymers are conducted in the same manner as for metals (Chapter 8); that is, a stress (normally tensile) is applied instantaneously and is maintained at a constant level while strain is measured as a function of time. Furthermore, the tests are performed under isothermal conditions. Creep results are represented as a time-dependent creep modulus E
c(t), defined by2
 Ec(t)=𝜎0
𝜀(t) (15.2)
where 𝜎0 is the constant applied stress and 𝜀(t) is the time-dependent strain. The creep 
modulus is also temperature sensitive and decreases with increasing temperature. With regard to the influence of molecular structure on the creep characteristics, as a general rule the susceptibility to creep decreases [i.e., E
c(t) increases] as the degree of 
crystallinity increases.
2Creep compliance, Jc(t), the reciprocal of the creep modulus, is also sometimes used in this context.The fracture strengths of polymeric materials are low relative to those of metals and ceramics. As a general rule, the mode of fracture in thermosetting polymers (heavily crosslinked networks) is brittle. In simple terms, during the fracture process, cracks form at regions where there is a localized stress concentration (i.e., scratches, notches, and sharp flaws). As with metals (Section 8.5), the stress is amplified at the tips of these cracks, leading to crack propagation and fracture. Covalent bonds in the network or crosslinked structure are severed during fracture. For thermoplastic polymers, both ductile and brittle modes are possible, and many of these materials are capable of experiencing a ductile-to-brittle transition. Factors that favor brittle fracture are a reduction in temperature, an increase in strain rate, the pres-ence of a sharp notch, an increase in specimen thickness, and any modification of the polymer structure that raises the glass transition temperature ( T
g) (see Section 15.14). 
Glassy thermoplastics are brittle below their glass transition temperatures. However, as the temperature is raised, they become ductile in the vicinity of their T
gs and experi-
ence plastic yielding prior to fracture. This behavior is demonstrated by the stress–strain characteristics of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in Figure 15.3. At 4 °C, PMMA is 
totally brittle, whereas at 60 °C it becomes extremely ductile.15.5 FRACTURE OF POLYMERSConcept Check 15.2 An amorphous polystyrene that is deformed at 120 °C will exhibit

520  •   Chapter 15  /  Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers
 One phenomenon that frequently precedes fracture in some thermoplastic polymers 
is crazing. Associated with crazes are regions of very localized plastic deformation, which 
lead to the formation of small and interconnected microvoids (Figure 15.9 a). Fibrillar 
bridges form between these microvoids wherein molecular chains become oriented as in Figure 15.13d . If the applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges elongate and break, 
causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce. As the microvoids coalesce, cracks begin to form, as demonstrated in Figure 15.9b . A craze is different from a crack in that it can support 
a load across its face. Furthermore, this process of craze growth prior to cracking absorbs fracture energy and effectively increases the fracture toughness of the polymer. In glassy polymers, the cracks propagate with little craze formation, resulting in low fracture tough-nesses. Crazes form at highly stressed regions associated with scratches, flaws, and molecular inhomogeneities; in addition, they propagate perpendicular to the applied tensile stress and typically are 5 μm or less thick. The photomicrograph in Figure 15.10 shows a craze.Figure 15.9  Schematic drawings of (a) a craze showing microvoids and fibrillar bridges and (b) a craze followed

15.6 Miscellaneous Mechanical Characteristics  •   521
 Principles of fracture mechanics developed in Section 8.5 also apply to brittle and 
quasi-brittle polymers; the susceptibility of these materials to fracture when a crack is present may be expressed in terms of the plane strain fracture toughness. The mag-nitude of K
Ic depends on characteristics of the polymer (molecular weight, percent 
crystallinity, etc.), as well as on temperature, strain rate, and the external environment. Representative values of K
Ic for several polymers are given in Table 8.1 and Table B.5, 
Appendix B.
Impact Strength
The degree of resistance of a polymeric material to impact loading may be of concern in some applications. Izod or Charpy tests are ordinarily used to assess impact strength (Section 8.6). As with metals, polymers may exhibit ductile or brittle fracture under impact 
loading conditions, depending on the temperature, specimen size, strain rate, and mode of loading, as discussed in the preceding section. Both semicrystalline and amorphous polymers are brittle at low temperatures, and both have relatively low impact strengths. However, they experience a ductile-to-brittle transition over a relatively narrow temperature range, similar to that shown for a steel in Figure 8.14. Of course, impact strength undergoes a gradual decrease at still higher temperatures as the polymer begins to soften. Ordinarily, the two impact characteristics most sought after are a high impact strength at the ambient tem-perature and a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature that lies below room temperature.
Fatigue
Polymers may experience fatigue failure under conditions of cyclic loading. As with metals, fatigue occurs at stress levels that are low relative to the yield strength. Fatigue testing in polymers has not been nearly as extensive as with metals; however, fatigue data are plotted in the same manner for both types of material, and the resulting curves have the same general shape. Fatigue curves for several common polymers are shown in Figure 15.11 as stress versus the number of cycles to failure (on a logarithmic scale). 15.6 MISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Mechanisms of Deformation 
and for Strengthening of PolymersSome polymers have a fatigue limit (a stress level at which the stress at failure becomes 
independent of the number of cycles); others do not appear to have such a limit. As 
would be expected, fatigue strengths and fatigue limits for polymeric materials are much lower than for metals. The fatigue behavior of polymers is much more sensitive to loading frequency than for metals. Cycling polymers at high frequencies and/or relatively large stresses can cause localized heating; consequently, failure may be due to a softening of the material rather than a result of typical fatigue processes.
Tear Strength and Hardness
Other mechanical properties that are sometimes influential in the suitability of a poly-mer for some particular application include tear resistance and hardness. The ability to resist tearing is an important property of some plastics, especially those used for thin films in packaging. Tear strength, the mechanical parameter measured, is the energy required to tear apart a cut specimen that has a standard geometry. The magnitude of tensile and tear strengths are related. As with metals, hardness represents a material’s resistance to scratching, penetra-tion, marring, and so on. Polymers are softer than metals and ceramics, and most hard-ness tests are conducted by penetration techniques similar to those described for metals in Section 6.10. Rockwell tests are frequently used for polymers.

4ASTM Standard D2240, “Standard Test Method for Rubber Property—Durometer Hardness;” and ASTM Standard 
D2583, “Standard Test Method for Indentation Hardness of Rigid Plastics by Means of a Barcol Impressor.”An understanding of deformation mechanisms of polymers is important to be able to manage the mechanical characteristics of these materials. In this regard, deformation models for two different types of polymers—semicrystalline and elastomeric—deserve our attention. The stiffness and strength of semicrystalline materials are often important considerations; elastic and plastic deformation mechanisms are treated in the succeeding section, whereas methods used to stiffen and strengthen these materials are discussed in Section 15.8. However, elastomers are used on the basis of their unusual elastic proper-ties; the deformation mechanism of elastomers is also treated.
Many semicrystalline polymers in bulk form have the spherulitic structure described in Section 14.12. By way of review, each spherulite consists of numerous chain-folded ribbons, or lamellae, that radiate outward from the center. Separating these lamellae are areas of amorphous material (Figure 14.13); adjacent lamellae are connected by tie chains that pass through these amorphous regions.

the first stage of deformation. (c) Increase in lamellar crystallite thickness (which is reversible) due to bending and stretching of chains in crystallite regions.
Mechanism of Elastic Deformation
As with other material types, elastic deformation of polymers occurs at relatively low 
stress levels on the stress–strain curve (Figure 15.1). The onset of elastic deformation for semicrystalline polymers results from chain molecules in amorphous regions elongating in the direction of the applied tensile stress. This process is represented schematically for two adjacent chain-folded lamellae and the interlamellar amorphous material as Stage 1 in Figure 15.12. Continued deformation in the second stage occurs by changes in both amorphous and lamellar crystalline regions. Amorphous chains continue to align and become elongated; in addition, there is bending and stretching of the strong chain covalent bonds within the lamellar crystallites. This leads to a slight, reversible increase in the lamellar crystallite thickness as indicated by Δt in Figure 15.12c.
 Inasmuch as semicrystalline polymers are composed of both crystalline and amor-phous regions, they may, in a sense, be considered composite materials. Therefore, the elastic modulus may be taken as some combination of the moduli of crystalline and amorphous phases.
Mechanism of Plastic Deformation
The transition from elastic to plastic deformation occurs in Stage 3 of Figure 15.13. (Note that Figure 15.12c is identical to Figure 15.13a.) During Stage 3, adjacent chains in the lamellae slide past one another (Figure 15.13 b); this results in tilting of the lamellae 
so that the chain folds become more aligned with the tensile axis. Any chain displace-
ment is resisted by relatively weak secondary or van der Waals bonds. Crystalline block segments separate from the lamellae in Stage 4 (Figure 15.13c), with the segments attached to one another by tie chains. In the final stage, Stage 5, the blocks and tie chains become oriented in the direction of the tensile axis (Figure 15.13 d). 
Thus, appreciable tensile deformation of semicrystalline polymers produces a highly ori-ented structure. This process of orientation is referred to as drawing, and is commonly 
used to improve the mechanical properties of polymer fibers and films (this is discussed in more detail in Section 15.25). During deformation, the spherulites experience shape changes for moderate levels of elongation. However, for large deformations, the spherulitic structure is virtually destroyed. Also, to a degree, the processes represented in Figure 15.13 are reversible. That is, if deformation is terminated at some arbitrary stage and the specimen is heated to an elevated temperature near its melting point (i.e., is annealed), the material will recrystallize to again form a spherulitic structure. Furthermore, the specimen will tend to shrink back, in part, to the dimensions it had prior to deformation. The extent of this shape and structural recovery depends on the annealing temperature and also the degree of elongation.
drawing
A number of factors influence the mechanical characteristics of polymeric materials. For example, we have already discussed the effects of temperature and strain rate on stress–strain behavior (Section 15.2, Figure 15.3). Again, increasing the temperature or diminishing the strain rate leads to a decrease in the tensile modulus, a reduction in tensile strength, and an enhancement of ductility. In addition, several structural/processing factors have decided influences on the mechanical behavior (i.e., strength and modulus) of polymeric materials. An increase in strength results whenever any restraint is imposed on the process illustrated in Figure 15.13; for example, extensive chain entanglements or a significant degree of intermolecular bond-ing inhibit relative chain motions. Even though secondary intermolecular (e.g., van der Waals) bonds are much weaker than the primary covalent ones, significant intermolecular forces result from the formation of large numbers of van der Waals interchain bonds. Furthermore, the modulus rises as both the secondary bond strength and chain alignment increase. As a result, polymers with polar groups will have stronger secondary bonds and a larger elastic modulus. We now discuss how several structural/processing factors [molecu-lar weight, degree of crystallinity, predeformation (drawing), and heat-treating] affect the mechanical behavior of polymers.
Molecular Weight
The magnitude of the tensile modulus does not seem to be directly influenced by mo-lecular weight. On the other hand, for many polymers it has been observed that tensile strength increases with increasing molecular weight. TS is a function of the number-
average molecular weight,

where TS∞ is the tensile strength at infinite molecular weight and A  is a constant. The 
behavior described by this equation is explained by increased chain entanglements with 
rising Mn.
Degree of Crystallinity
For a specific polymer, the degree of crystallinity can have a significant influence on the mechanical properties because it affects the extent of the intermolecular secondary bonding. For crystalline regions in which molecular chains are closely packed in an or-dered and parallel arrangement, extensive secondary bonding typically exists between adjacent chain segments. This secondary bonding is much less prevalent in amorphous regions, by virtue of the chain misalignment. As a consequence, for semicrystalline poly-mers, tensile modulus increases significantly with degree of crystallinity. For example, for polyethylene, the modulus increases approximately an order of magnitude as the crystallinity fraction is raised from 0.3 to 0.6. Furthermore, increasing the crystallinity of a polymer generally enhances its strength; in addition, the material tends to become more brittle. The influence of chain chemistry and structure (branching, stereoisomerism, etc.) on degree of crystallinity was discussed in Chapter 14. The effects of both percent crystallinity and molecular weight on the physical state of polyethylene are represented in Figure 15.14.
Predeformation by Drawing
On a commercial basis, one of the most important techniques used to improve mechani-cal strength and tensile modulus is to permanently deform the polymer in tension. This procedure is sometimes termed drawing and it corresponds to the neck extension process illustrated schematically in Figure 15.4. In terms of property alterations, drawing is the polymer analogue of strain hardening in metals. It is an important stiffening and strengthening technique that is employed in the production of fibers and films. During drawing the molecular chains slip past one another and become highly oriented; for semicrystalline materials the chains assume conformations similar to that represented schematically in Figure 15.13d. Degrees of strengthening and stiffening depend on the extent of deformation (or extension) of the material. Furthermore, the properties of drawn polymers are highly anisotropic. For materials drawn in uniaxial tension, tensile modulus and strength values

are significantly greater in the direction of deformation than in other directions. Tensile 
modulus in the direction of drawing may be enhanced by up to approximately a factor of three relative to the undrawn material. At an angle of 45 ° from the tensile axis, the 
modulus is a minimum; at this orientation, the modulus has a value on the order of one-fifth that of the undrawn polymer. Tensile strength parallel to the direction of orientation may be improved by a factor of at least two to five relative to that of the unoriented material. However, perpendicular to the alignment direction, tensile strength is reduced by on the order of one-third to one-half. For an amorphous polymer that is drawn at an elevated temperature, the oriented molecular structure is retained only when the material is quickly cooled to the ambient temperature; this procedure gives rise to the strengthening and stiffening effects de-scribed in the previous paragraph. However, if, after stretching, the polymer is held at the temperature of drawing, molecular chains relax and assume random conformations characteristic of the predeformed state; as a consequence, drawing will have no effect on the mechanical characteristics of the material.
Heat-Treating
Heat-treating (or annealing) of semicrystalline polymers can lead to an increase in the percent crystallinity and crystallite size and perfection, as well as to modifications of the spherulite structure. For undrawn materials that are subjected to constant-time heat treatments, increasing the annealing temperature leads to the following: (1) an increase in tensile modulus, (2) an increase in yield strength, and (3) a reduction in ductility. Note that these annealing effects are opposite to those typically observed for metallic materi-als (Section 7.12)—weakening, softening, and enhanced ductility. For some polymer fibers that have been drawn, the influence of annealing on the tensile modulus is contrary to that for undrawn materials—that is, the modulus de-creases with increased annealing temperature because of a loss of chain orientation and strain-induced crystallinity.

Shrink-Wrap Polymer FilmsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 15.1
An interesting application of heat treatment in 
polymers is the shrink-wrap used in packag-
ing. Shrink-wrap is a polymer film, usually made of poly(vinyl chloride), polyethylene, or polyolefin (a multilayer sheet with alternating layers of poly-ethylene and polypropylene). It is initially plastically deformed (cold drawn) by about 20% to 300% to provide a prestretched (aligned) film. The film is wrapped around an object to be packaged and sealed at the edges. When heated to about 100 °C to 150°C, 
this prestretched material shrinks to recover 80% to 90% of its initial deformation, which gives a tightly stretched, wrinkle-free, transparent polymer film. For example, DVDs and many other consumer products are packaged in shrink-wrap.
One of the fascinating properties of the elastomeric materials is their rubberlike elasticity—that is, they have the ability to be deformed to quite large deformations and then elastically spring back to their original form. This results from crosslinks in the polymer that provide a force to restore the chains to their undeformed conformations. Elastomeric behavior was probably first observed in natural rubber; however, the past several decades have brought about the synthesis of a large number of elastomers with a wide variety of properties. Typical stress–strain characteristics of elastomeric materials are displayed in Figure 15.1, curve C. Their moduli of elasticity are quite small, and, they vary with strain because the 
stress–strain curve is nonlinear. In an unstressed state, an elastomer is amorphous and composed of crosslinked molecular chains that are highly twisted, kinked, and coiled. Elastic deformation upon application of a tensile load is simply the partial uncoiling, untwisting, and straight-ening and resultant elongation of the chains in the stress direction, a phenomenon represented in Figure 15.15. Upon release of the stress, the chains spring back to their prestressed conformations, and the macroscopic piece returns to its original shape. Part of the driving force for elastic deformation is a thermodynamic parameter called entropy,  which is a measure of the degree of disorder within a system; entropy in-
creases with increasing disorder. As an elastomer is stretched and the chains straighten and become more aligned, the system becomes more ordered. From this state, the entropy increases if the chains return to their original kinked and coiled contours. Two intriguing phenomena result from this entropic effect. First, when stretched, an elastomer experiences a rise in temperature; second, the modulus of elasticity increases with increasing temperature, which is opposite to the behavior found in other materials (see Figure 6.8).15.9 DEFORMATION OF ELASTOMERSTop: An electrical connection positioned within a section

15.9 Deformation of Elastomers  •   529
 Several criteria must be met for a polymer to be elastomeric: (1) It must not eas-
ily crystallize; elastomeric materials are amorphous, having molecular chains that are naturally coiled and kinked in the unstressed state. (2) Chain bond rotations must be relatively free for the coiled chains to readily respond to an applied force. (3) For elas-tomers to experience relatively large elastic deformations, the onset of plastic deforma-tion must be delayed. Restricting the motions of chains past one another by crosslinking accomplishes this objective. The crosslinks act as anchor points between the chains and prevent chain slippage from occurring; the role of crosslinks in the deformation process is illustrated in Figure 15.15. Crosslinking in many elastomers is carried out in a process called vulcanization, to be discussed shortly. (4) Finally, the elastomer must be above its glass transition temperature (Section 15.13). The lowest temperature at which rubberlike 
behavior persists for many of the common elastomers is between −50°C and −90°C 
(−60°F and −130°F). Below its glass transition temperature, an elastomer becomes brit-tle, and its stress–strain behavior resembles curve A in Figure 15.1.
Vulcanization
The crosslinking process in elastomers is called vulcanization, which is achieved by a 
nonreversible chemical reaction, typically carried out at an elevated temperature. In most vulcanizing reactions, sulfur compounds are added to the heated elastomer; chains of sulfur atoms bond with adjacent polymer backbone chains and crosslink them, which is accomplished according to the following reaction:

in which the two crosslinks shown consist of m and n sulfur atoms. Crosslink main-chain 
sites are carbon atoms that were doubly bonded before vulcanization but, after vulcani-zation, have become singly bonded.
Unvulcanized rubber, which contains very few crosslinks, is soft and tacky and 
has poor resistance to abrasion. Modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, and resis-tance to degradation by oxidation are all enhanced by vulcanization. The magnitude 
of the modulus of elasticity is directly proportional to the density of the crosslinks. vulcanizationFigure 15.15  Schematic representation

Crystallization, Melting, and Glass-Transition 
Phenomena in Polymers
Three phenomena that are important with respect to the design and processing of poly-
meric materials are crystallization, melting, and the glass transition. Crystallization is the process by which, upon cooling, an ordered (i.e., crystalline) solid phase is produced Stress–strain curves for vulcanized and unvulcanized natural rubber are presented in Figure 15.16. To produce a rubber that is capable of large extensions without rupture of the primary chain bonds, there must be relatively few crosslinks, and these must be widely separated. Useful rubbers result when about 1 to 5 parts (by weight) of sulfur are added to 100 parts of rubber. This corresponds to about one crosslink for every 10 to 20 repeat units. Increasing the sulfur content further hardens the rubber and also reduces its extensibility. Also, because they are crosslinked, elastomeric materials are thermosetting in nature.

from a liquid melt having a highly random molecular structure. The melting transforma-
tion is the reverse process that occurs when a polymer is heated. The glass-transition phenomenon occurs with amorphous or noncrystallizable polymers that, when cooled from a liquid melt, become rigid solids yet retain the disordered molecular structure that is characteristic of the liquid state. Of course, alterations of physical and mechanical properties attend crystallization, melting, and the glass transition. Furthermore, for semicrystalline polymers, crystalline regions will experience melting (and crystallization), whereas noncrystalline areas pass through the glass transition.
An understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of polymer crystallization is important 
because the degree of crystallinity influences the mechanical and thermal properties of these materials. The crystallization of a molten polymer occurs by nucleation and growth processes, topics discussed in the context of phase transformations for metals in Section 10.3. For polymers, upon cooling through the melting temperature, nuclei form, in which small regions of the tangled and random molecules become ordered and aligned in the manner of chain-folded layers (Figure 14.12). At temperatures in excess of the melting temperature, these nuclei are unstable because of the thermal atomic vibrations that tend to disrupt the ordered molecular arrangements. Subsequent to nucleation and during the crystallization growth stage, nuclei grow by the continued ordering and aligning of additional molecular chain segments; that is, the chain-folded layers remain the same thickness, but increase in lateral dimensions, or for spherulitic structures (Figure 14.13) there is an increase in spherulite radius. The time dependence of crystallization is the same as for many solid-state trans-formations (Figure 10.10); that is, a sigmoidal-shaped curve results when fraction trans-formation (i.e., fraction crystallized) is plotted versus the logarithm of time (at constant temperature). Such a plot is presented in Figure 15.17 for the crystallization of poly-propylene at three temperatures. Mathematically, fraction crystallized y is a function of 
time t according to the Avrami equation, Equation 10.17, as
 y=1−exp(−kt
n) (10.17)
where k and n are time-independent constants, whose values depend on the crystallizing 
system. Normally, the extent of crystallization is measured by specimen volume changes because there will be a difference in volume for liquid and crystallized phases. Rate of 15.10 CRYSTALLIZATION

crystallization may be specified in the same manner as for the transformations discussed 
in Section 10.3, and according to Equation 10.18; that is, rate is equal to the reciprocal of time required for crystallization to proceed to 50% completion. This rate is dependent on crystallization temperature (Figure 15.17) and also on the molecular weight of the polymer; rate decreases with increasing molecular weight. For polypropylene (as well as any polymer), the attainment of 100% crystallinity is not possible. Therefore, in Figure 15.17, the vertical axis is scaled as normalized fraction crystal-
lized. A value of 1.0 for this parameter corresponds to the highest level of crystallization that is achieved during the tests, which, in reality, is less than complete crystallization.
The melting of a polymer crystal corresponds to the transformation of a solid material, having an ordered structure of aligned molecular chains, into a viscous liquid in which the structure is highly random. This phenomenon occurs, upon heating, at the melting 
temperature, T
m. There are several features distinctive to the melting of polymers that are 
not normally observed with metals and ceramics; these are consequences of the polymer molecular structures and lamellar crystalline morphology. First, melting of polymers takes place over a range of temperatures; this phenomenon is discussed in more detail shortly. In addition, the melting behavior depends on the history of the specimen, in particular the temperature at which it crystallized. The thickness of chain-folded lamellae depends on crystallization temperature; the thicker the lamellae, the higher the melting tempera-ture. Impurities in the polymer and imperfections in the crystals also decrease the melting temperature. Finally, the apparent melting behavior is a function of the rate of heating; increasing this rate results in an elevation of the melting temperature. As Section 15.8 notes, polymeric materials are responsive to heat treatments that produce structural and property alterations. An increase in lamellar thickness may be induced by annealing just below the melting temperature. Annealing also raises the melting temperature by decreasing the vacancies and other imperfections in polymer crystals and increasing crystallite thickness.melting temperature15.11 MELTING
The glass transition occurs in amorphous (or glassy) and semicrystalline polymers and is due to a reduction in motion of large segments of molecular chains with decreasing tem-perature. Upon cooling, the glass transition corresponds to the gradual transformation from a liquid into a rubbery material and finally into a rigid solid. The temperature at which the polymer experiences the transition from rubbery into rigid states is termed the 
glass transition temperature, T
g. This sequence of events occurs in the reverse order when 
a rigid glass at a temperature below Tg is heated. In addition, abrupt changes in other 
physical properties accompany this glass transition: for example, stiffness (Figure 15.7), 
heat capacity, and coefficient of thermal expansion.glass transition 
 temperature15.12 THE GLASS TRANSITION
Melting and glass transition temperatures are important parameters relative to in-
service applications of polymers. They define, respectively, the upper and lower tem-perature limits for numerous applications, especially for semicrystalline polymers. The glass transition temperature may also define the upper use temperature for glassy amor-phous materials. Furthermore, T
m and Tg also influence the fabrication and processing 
procedures for polymers and polymer–matrix composites. These issues are discussed in succeeding sections of this chapter.15.13 MELTING AND GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURES
15.13 Melting and Glass Transition Temperatures   •  533
 The temperatures at which melting and/or the glass transition occur for a polymer are 
determined in the same manner as for ceramic materials—from a plot of specific volume (the reciprocal of density) versus temperature. Figure 15.18 is such a plot, where curves A  and C , 
for amorphous and crystalline polymers, respectively, have the same configurations as their ceramic counterparts (Figure 13.13).
5 For the crystalline material, there is a discontinuous 
change in specific volume at the melting temperature Tm. The curve for the totally amor-
phous material is continuous but experiences a slight decrease in slope at the glass transition temperature, T
g. The behavior is intermediate between these extremes for a semicrystalline 
polymer (curve B ), in that both melting and glass transition phenomena are observed; Tm 
and Tg are properties of the respective crystalline and amorphous phases in this semicrystal-
line material. As discussed earlier, the behaviors represented in Figure 15.18 will depend on the rate of cooling or heating. Representative melting and glass transition temperatures of a number of polymers are given in Table 15.2 and Appendix E.Figure 15.18  Specific volume versus

Melting Temperature
During melting of a polymer there is a rearrangement of the molecules in the transfor-
mation from ordered to disordered molecular states. Molecular chemistry and structure influence the ability of the polymer chain molecules to make these rearrangements and, therefore, also affect the melting temperature. Chain stiffness, which is controlled by the ease of rotation about the chemical bonds along the chain, has a pronounced effect. The presence of double bonds and aromatic groups in the polymer backbone lowers chain flexibility and causes an increase in T
m. Furthermore, the size and type of side groups influence chain rota-
tional freedom and flexibility; bulky or large side groups tend to restrict molecular rotation and raise T
m. For example, polypropylene has a higher melting tempera-
ture than polyethylene (175° C vs. 115° C, Table 15.2); the CH3 methyl side group 
for polypropylene is larger than the H atom found on polyethylene. The presence of polar groups (Cl, OH, and CN), even though not excessively large, leads to sig-nificant intermolecular bonding forces and relatively high T
ms. This may be verified 
by comparing the melting temperatures of polypropylene (175° C) and poly(vinyl 
chloride) (212° C).
 The melting temperature of a polymer also depends on molecular weight. At relatively low molecular weights, increasing M
 (or chain length) raises Tm (Figure 
15.19). Furthermore, the melting of a polymer takes place over a range of tempera-tures; thus, there is a range of T
ms rather than a single melting temperature. This 
is because every polymer is composed of molecules having a variety of molecular weights (Section 14.5) and because T
m depends on molecular weight. For most poly-
mers, this melting temperature range is on the order of several degrees Celsius. The melting temperatures cited in Table 15.2 and Appendix E are near the high ends of these ranges. Degree of branching also affects the melting temperature of a polymer. The intro-duction of side branches introduces defects into the crystalline material and lowers the melting temperature.

has a higher melting temperature (137°C, Table 15.2) than low-density polyethylene 
(115°C), which has some branching.
Glass Transition Temperature
Upon heating through the glass transition temperature, the amorphous solid poly-mer transforms from a rigid into a rubbery state. Correspondingly, the molecules that are virtually frozen in position below T
g begin to experience rotational and 
translational motions above Tg. Thus, the value of the glass transition temperature 
depends on molecular characteristics that affect chain stiffness; most of these fac-tors and their influences are the same as for the melting temperature, as discussed earlier. Again, chain flexibility is decreased and T
g is increased by the presence of 
the following:
 1. Bulky side groups; from Table 15.2, the respective Tg values for polypropylene 
and polystyrene are −18°C and 100°C.
 2. Polar groups; for example, the Tg values for poly(vinyl chloride) and 
polypropylene are 87 °C and − 18°C, respectively.
 3. Double bonds and aromatic groups in the backbone, which tend to stiffen the 
polymer chain.
 Increasing the molecular weight also tends to raise the glass transition temperature, 
as noted in Figure 15.19. A small amount of branching tends to lower Tg; on the other 
hand, a high density of branches reduces chain mobility and elevates the glass transi-tion temperature. Some amorphous polymers are crosslinked, which has been observed to elevate T
g; crosslinks restrict molecular motion. With a high density of crosslinks, 
molecular motion is virtually disallowed; long-range molecular motion is prevented, to the degree that these polymers do not experience a glass transition or its accompanying softening.
 From the preceding discussion it is evident that essentially the same molecular char-
acteristics raise and lower both melting and glass transition temperatures. Normally the value of T
g lies somewhere between 0.5Tm and 0.8Tm (in Kelvin). Consequently, for a 
homopolymer, it is not possible to independently vary both Tm and Tg. A greater degree 
of control over these two parameters is possible by the synthesis and use of copolymeric materials.

Polymer Types
There are many different polymeric materials that are familiar and find a wide variety 
of applications; in fact, one way of classifying them is according to their end use. Within this scheme the various polymer types include plastics, elastomers (or rubbers), fibers, coatings, adhesives, foams, and films. Depending on its properties, a particular polymer may be used in two or more of these application categories. For example, a plastic, if crosslinked and used above its glass transition temperature, may make a satisfactory elastomer, or a fiber material may be used as a plastic if it is not drawn into filaments. This portion of the chapter includes a brief discussion of each of these types of polymer.
Possibly the largest number of different polymeric materials come under the plastic clas-sification. Plastics are materials that have some structural rigidity under load and are 
used in general-purpose applications. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, and the fluorocarbons, epoxies, phenolics, and polyesters may all be clas-sified as plastics. They have a wide variety of combinations of properties. Some plastics are very rigid and brittle (Figure 15.1, curve A). Others are flexible, exhibiting both 
elastic and plastic deformations when stressed and sometimes experiencing considerable deformation before fracture (Figure 15.1, curve B).
 Polymers falling within this classification may have any degree of crystallin-ity, and all molecular structures and configurations (linear, branched, isotactic, etc.) are possible. Plastic materials may be either thermoplastic or thermosetting; in fact, this is the manner in which they are usually subclassified. However, to be considered plastics, linear or branched polymers must be used below their glass transition temperatures (if amorphous) or below their melting temperatures (if semicrystalline), or they must be crosslinked enough to maintain their shape. The trade names, characteristics, and typical applications for a number of plastics are given in Table 15.3. Several plastics exhibit especially outstanding properties. For applications in which optical transparency is critical, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) are espe-cially well suited; however, it is imperative that the material be highly amorphous or, if semicrystalline, have very small crystallites. The fluorocarbons have a low coefficient of friction and are extremely resistant to attack by a host of chemicals, even at relatively high temperatures. They are used as coatings on nonstick cookware, in bearings and bushings, and for high-temperature electronic components.

15.16 Elastomers  •   539
The characteristics of and deformation mechanism for elastomers were treated previ-
ously (Section 15.9). The present discussion, therefore, focuses on the types of elasto-meric materials. Table 15.4 lists properties and applications of common elastomers; these properties are typical and depend on the degree of vulcanization and on whether any reinforce-ment is used. Natural rubber is still used to a large degree because it has an outstanding combination of desirable properties. However, the most important synthetic elastomer is SBR, which is used predominantly in automobile tires, reinforced with carbon black. NBR, which is highly resistant to degradation and swelling, is another common synthetic elastomer. For many applications (e.g., automobile tires), the mechanical properties of even vulcanized rubbers are not satisfactory in terms of tensile strength, abrasion and tear resistance, and stiffness. These characteristics may be further improved by additives such as carbon black (Section 16.2).15.16 ELASTOMERSPhenolic Billiard BallsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 15.2
Up until about 1912, virtually all billiard balls were made of ivory from the tusks of elephants. For a 
ball to roll true, it needed to be fashioned from high-quality ivory that came from the center of flaw-free tusks—on the order of 1 tusk in 50 had the requisite consistency of density. At this time, ivory was becoming scarce and expensive as more and more elephants were being killed (and as billiards was becoming increasingly popular). There was then, and still is, a serious concern about reductions in elephant populations and their ul-timate extinction due to ivory hunters, and some coun-tries had imposed (and still impose) severe restrictions on the importation of ivory and ivory products.
Consequently, substitutes for ivory were sought 
for billiard balls. One early alternative was a pressed mixture of wood pulp and bone dust; this material proved quite unsatisfactory. The most suitable re-placement, which is still being used for billiard balls today is one of the first synthetic polymers—phenol- formaldehyde, sometimes also called phenolic.
The invention of this material is one of the impor-
tant and interesting events in the annals of synthetic  polymers. The discoverer of the process for synthesiz-ing phenol-formaldehyde was Leo Baekeland. As a 
young and very bright Ph.D. chemist, he emigrated from  Belgium to the United States in the early 1900s. Shortly after his arrival, he began research into creating a syn-thetic shellac to replace the natural material, which was relatively expensive to manufacture; shellac was, and still is, used as a lacquer, a wood preservative, and an elec-trical insulator in the then-emerging electrical industry. 
His efforts eventually led to the discovery that a suitable substitute could be synthesized by reacting phenol [or carbolic acid (C
6H5OH), a white crystalline material], 
with formaldehyde (HCHO, a colorless and poisonous gas) under controlled conditions of heat and pressure. The product of this reaction was a liquid that subse-quently hardened into a transparent and amber-colored solid. Baekeland named his new material Bakelite; to-day we use the generic name phenol-formaldehyde or just phenolic. Shortly after its discovery, Bakelite was 
found to be the ideal synthetic material for billiard balls (per the chapter-opening photographs).
Phenol-formaldehyde is a thermosetting polymer 
and has a number of desirable properties; for a poly-mer, it is very heat resistant and hard; is less brittle than many of the ceramic materials; is very stable and unre-active with most common solutions and solvents; and doesn’t easily chip, fade, or discolor. Furthermore, it is a relatively inexpensive material, and modern phenolics can be produced having a large variety of colors. The elastic characteristics of this polymer are very similar to those of ivory, and when phenolic billiard balls collide, they make the same clicking sound as ivory balls. Other uses of this important polymeric material are given in Table 15.3.

15.17 Fibers  •   541
Fiber polymers are capable of being drawn into long filaments having at least a 100:1 
length-to-diameter ratio. Most commercial fiber polymers are used in the textile indus-try, being woven or knit into cloth or fabric. In addition, the aramid fibers are employed in composite materials (Section 16.8). To be useful as a textile material, a fiber polymer must have a host of rather restrictive physical and chemical properties. While in use, fibers may be subjected to a variety of mechanical deformations—stretching, twisting, shearing, and abrasion. Consequently, they must have a high tensile strength (over a relatively wide temperature range) and a high modulus of elasticity, as well as abrasion resistance. These properties are governed by the chemistry of the polymer chains and also by the fiber-drawing process. The molecular weight of fiber materials should be relatively high or the molten material will be too weak and will break during the drawing process. Also, because the tensile strength increases with degree of crystallinity, the structure and configuration of the chains should allow the production of a highly crystalline polymer. That translates into a requirement for linear and unbranched chains that are symmetrical and have regular repeat units. Polar groups in the polymer also improve the fiber-forming proper-ties by increasing both crystallinity and the intermolecular forces between the chains. Convenience in washing and maintaining clothing depends primarily on the thermal properties of the fiber polymer, that is, its melting and glass transition temperatures. Furthermore, fiber polymers must exhibit chemical stability to a rather extensive variety of environments, including acids, bases, bleaches, dry-cleaning solvents, and sunlight. In addition, they must be relatively nonflammable and amenable to drying.fiber15.17 FIBERSwhere R and R′ represent side-bonded atoms such as hydrogen or groups of atoms such as CH

Of course, as elastomers, these materials are crosslinked. The silicone elastomers possess a high degree of flexibility at low temperatures [to −90°C (− 130°F)] and yet are stable to temperatures as high as 250° C (480° F). In addition, 
they are resistant to weathering and lubricating oils, which makes them particularly desirable for applications in automobile engine compartments. Biocompatibility is another of their assets, and, therefore, they are often employed in medical applications such as blood tubing. A further attractive characteristic is that some silicone rubbers vulcanize at room temperature (RTV rubbers).

Coatings
Coatings are frequently applied to the surface of materials to serve one or more of the 
following functions: (1) to protect the item from the environment, which may produce corrosive or deteriorative reactions; (2) to improve the item’s appearance; and (3) to provide electrical insulation. Many of the ingredients in coating materials are polymers, most of which are organic in origin. These organic coatings fall into several different classifications: paint, varnish, enamel, lacquer, and shellac. Many common coatings are latexes. A latex is a stable suspension of small, insoluble polymer particles dispersed in water. These materials have become increasingly popular because they do not contain large quantities of organic solvents that are emitted into the environment—that is, they have low volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. VOCs react in the atmosphere to produce smog. Large users of coatings such as auto-mobile manufacturers continue to reduce their VOC emissions to comply with environ-mental regulations.
Adhesives
An adhesive is a substance used to bond together the surfaces of two solid materials 
(termed adherends). There are two types of bonding mechanisms: mechanical and 
chemical. In mechanical bonding there is actual penetration of the adhesive into surface pores and crevices. Chemical bonding involves intermolecular forces between the adhe-sive and adherend, which forces may be covalent and/or van der Waals; the degree of van der Waals bonding is enhanced when the adhesive material contains polar groups. Although natural adhesives (animal glue, casein, starch, and rosin) are still used for many applications, a host of new adhesive materials based on synthetic polymers have been developed; these include polyurethanes, polysiloxanes (silicones), epoxies, polyimides, acrylics, and rubber materials. Adhesives may be used to join a large variety of materials—metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, skin, and so on—and the choice of which adhesive to use will depend on such factors as (1) the materials to be bonded and their porosities; (2) the required adhesive properties (i.e., whether the bond is to be temporary or permanent); (3) maximum/minimum exposure temperatures; and (4) processing conditions. For all but the pressure-sensitive adhesives (discussed shortly), the adhesive ma-terial is applied as a low-viscosity liquid, so as to cover the adherend surfaces evenly and completely and allow for maximum bonding interactions. The actual bonding joint forms as the adhesive undergoes a liquid-to-solid transition (or cures), which may be accomplished through either a physical process (e.g., crystallization, solvent evaporation) or a chemical process [e.g., polymerization (Section 15.21), vulcanization]. Characteristics of a sound joint should include high shear, peel, and fracture strengths. Adhesive bonding offers some advantages over other joining technologies (e.g., riveting, bolting, and welding), including lighter weight, the ability to join dissimilar materials and thin components, better fatigue resistance, and lower manufacturing costs. Furthermore, it is the technology of choice when exact positioning of components and processing speed are essential. The chief drawback of adhesive joints is service tempera-ture limitation; polymers maintain their mechanical integrity only at relatively low tem-peratures, and strength decreases rapidly with increasing temperature. The maximum temperature possible for continuous use for some of the newly developed polymers is 300°C. Adhesive joints are found in a large number of applications, especially in the aerospace, automotive, and construction industries, in packaging, and in some house-hold goods. A special class of this group of materials is the pressure-sensitive adhesives (or self-adhesive materials), such as those found on self-stick tapes, labels, and postage stamps. adhesive15.18 MISCELLANEOUS APPLICATIONS
15.19 Polymeric Biomaterials  •   543
These materials are designed to adhere to just about any surface by making contact 
and with the application of slight pressure. Unlike the adhesives described previously, bonding action does not result from a physical transformation or a chemical reaction. Rather, these materials contain polymer tackifying resins; during detachment of the two bonding surfaces, small fibrils form that are attached to the surfaces and tend to hold them together. Polymers used for pressure-sensitive adhesives include acrylics, styrenic block copolymers (Section 15.20), and natural rubber.
Films
Polymeric materials have found widespread use in the form of thin films. Films having thicknesses between 0.025 and 0.125 mm (0.001 and 0.005 in.) are fabricated and used ex-tensively as bags for packaging food products and other merchandise, as textile products, and in a host of other uses. Important characteristics of the materials produced and used as films include low density, a high degree of flexibility, high tensile and tear strengths, resistance to attack by moisture and other chemicals, and low permeability to some gases, especially water vapor (Section 14.14). Some of the polymers that meet these criteria and are manufactured in film form are polyethylene, polypropylene, cellophane, and cellulose acetate.
Foams
Foams are plastic materials that contain a relatively high volume percentage of small pores and trapped gas bubbles. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting materials are used as foams; these include polyurethane, rubber, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chlo-ride). Foams are commonly used as cushions in automobiles and furniture, as well as in packaging and thermal insulation. The foaming process is often carried out by incorpo-rating into the batch of material a blowing agent that, upon heating, decomposes with the liberation of a gas. Gas bubbles are generated throughout the now-fluid mass, which remain in the solid upon cooling and give rise to a spongelike structure. The same effect is produced by dissolving an inert gas into a molten polymer under high pressure. When the pressure is rapidly reduced, the gas comes out of solution and forms bubbles and pores that remain in the solid as it cools.foam
Polymers have a set of distinctive characteristics that make them desirable for a large number of biomedical applications inasmuch as they are chemically, structurally, and mechanically similar to most body tissues. In fact, of the three general material classes (metals, ceramics, and polymers), polymers are most commonly used in biomedical ap-plications. Polymer biomaterials may be divided into two main classifications: synthetic (man-
made) and natural (derived from plants or animals). Furthermore, relative to degree of stability in the body environment, they may also be further classified as either biode-gradable or nonbiodegradable. After implantation, biodegradable polymers gradually decompose or biodegrade and their constituents are removed from the body as a result of normal metabolic processes. On the other hand, nonbiodegradable (or biostable) polymers are designed to be nonreactive with body fluids and tissues; any deterioration of these materials is imperceptively slow. The mechanical and bioperformance charac-teristics of all polymer biomaterials depend on chemistry, molecular weight, molecular structure, molecular configuration, the presence of additives (kinds and concentrations) and, for copolymers, sequencing arrangement of the two repeat unit types.15.19 POLYMERIC BIOMATERIALS
544  •   Chapter 15  /  Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers
 Polymers discussed heretofore in this chapter are both synthetic and nonbiode-
gradable; therefore, we have elected to confine our discussion to several common polymeric biomaterials that fall within these two classifications.
Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene
Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (one of the advanced polymeric materials discussed in Section 15.20) is used in some important biomedical applications. When crosslinked (chemically or by ionizing radiation), UHMWPE materials are extremely resistant to wear and abrasion, have very low coefficients of friction, and offer self-lubricating and nonstick surfaces. This mix of properties makes these materials espe-cially attractive for load-bearing surfaces of orthopedic implants—viz. acetabular cups on artificial hip replacements and knee prosthesis components.
Poly(methyl methacrylate)
Poly(methyl methacrylate) and some of its copolymers possess several desirable bio-performance attributes to include hardness, chemical inertness, biocompatibility, opti-cal transparency (of the pure material), and ease of synthesis and fabrication at room 
temperature. PMMA is highly transparent (approximately 92% transmissivity), has a relatively high index of refraction (1.49), is highly biocompatible, and is also mechani-cally hard (but also quite brittle). PMMA is the primary constituent of bone cement (for the secure fixation of hip and knee prostheses to living bone); furthermore, it is also used in intraocular lenses and for hard contact lenses.
Polytetrafluoroethylene
Polytetrafluoroethylene has a high degree of chemical stability in the body environ-ment as a result of its strong carbon–fluorine interatomic bonds; furthermore, PTFE is not wetted by water (is hydrophobic) and has an extremely low coefficient of friction. However, it has relatively low modulus of elasticity and tensile strength values and poor wear resistance. The only inflammatory reactions with PTFE result from small wear particles that are generated from rubbing or abrasive forces. Typical biomedical applica-tions for PTFE include vascular grafts and soft-tissue (e.g., facial) prostheses. One type of PTFE, used in many cardiovascular devices (e.g., vascular and stent grafts), is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or e-PTFE. This material develops a micro-porous structure that is introduced during a stretching operation; its trade name is Gore-Tex.
Silicones
The silicones have a diverse set of desirable bioproperties and are used in a wide variety of application types. Depending on degree of crosslinking, silicones can be prepared to exist as elastomers, gels, and fluids. As elastomers, they are highly biocompatible when in contact with blood, are biodurable, have low surface tension values (i.e., are capable of wetting the surfaces of most materials), have high permeabilities to drugs and some gases (especially oxygen and water vapor), and retain these traits over a wide range of temperatures. Major limitations of the silicone elastomers include low strength and low tear resistance—characteristics that may be improved by the addition of filler materials. The most common filler is an amorphous silica (SiO
2). Furthermore, in addition to 
elastomers, the silicones may be used as adhesives, fluids, and resins. Bioapplications of the silicones are many and diverse, to include the following:
 • Gas-permeable membranes in extended-wear contact lenses and intraocular lenses
 • Catheters, drains, and shunts
 • Orthopedic implants—hand and foot joints • Aesthetic implants—breast and facial feature reconstructions (e.g., nose, chin, and ear)
15.20 Advanced Polymeric Materials  •   545
 • Coatings for hypodermic needles, syringes, and blood-collecting devices
 • Transdermal drug delivery • Dental impression materials
Poly(ethylene terephthalate)
The most notable biomaterial property of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (having the 
trade name Dacron) is blood compatibility—when in contact with blood, PET does not promote clotting. It is most commonly used as knitted or woven fabrics in cardio-vascular surgeries—for example, as vascular grafts and sewing rings on artificial heart valves. Other applications include sutures, fixation of implants, repair of hernias, and reconstruction of ligaments.
Polypropylene
The salient bioperformance properties of polypropylene include low tissue reactiv-ity and exceptional flexural fatigue life. On the other hand, in some environments it experiences oxidation and may crack. The principal bioapplication for PP is as nonbio-degradable sutures. Other uses include finger joint prostheses and surgical meshes for abdominal wall repair.
A number of new polymers having unique and desirable combinations of properties have been developed in recent years; many have found niches in new technologies and/or have satisfactorily replaced other materials. Some of these include ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, liquid crystal polymers, and thermoplastic elastomers. Each of these will now be discussed.
Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene
Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE) is a linear polyethylene that has 
an extremely high molecular weight. Its typical Mw is approximately 4 × 106 g/mol, which 
is an order of magnitude greater than that of high-density polyethylene. In fiber form, UHMWPE is highly aligned and has the trade name Spectra. Some of the extraordinary characteristics of this material are as follows:
 1. An extremely high impact resistance
 2. Outstanding resistance to wear and abrasion 3. A very low coefficient of friction 4. A self-lubricating and nonstick surface 5. Very good chemical resistance to normally encountered solvents 6. Excellent low-temperature properties 7. Outstanding sound damping and energy absorption characteristics 8. Electrically insulating and excellent dielectric properties
 However, because this material has a relatively low melting temperature, its me-
chanical properties deteriorate rapidly with increasing temperature. This unusual combination of properties leads to numerous and diverse applications for this material, including bulletproof vests, composite military helmets, fishing line, ski-bottom surfaces, golf-ball cores, bowling alley and ice-skating rink surfaces, bio-medical prostheses, blood filters, marking-pen nibs, bulk material handling equipment (for coal, grain, cement, gravel, etc.), bushings, pump impellers, and valve gaskets.ultra-high-molecular-
 weight polyethylene15.20 ADVANCED POLYMERIC MATERIALS
546  •   Chapter 15  /  Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers
Liquid Crystal Polymers
Liquid crystal polymers ( LCPs) are a group of chemically complex and structurally distinct 
materials that have unique properties and are used in diverse applications. Discussion of 
the chemistry of these materials is beyond the scope of this book. LCPs are composed of extended, rod-shaped, and rigid molecules. In terms of molecular arrangement, these  materials do not fall within any of conventional liquid, amorphous, crystalline, or semi-crystalline classifications but may be considered a new state of matter—the liquid crystal-line state, being neither crystalline nor liquid. In the melt (or liquid) condition, whereas other polymer molecules are randomly oriented, LCP molecules can become aligned in highly ordered configurations. As solids, this molecular alignment remains, and, in addition, the molecules form in domain structures having characteristic intermolecular spacings. A schematic comparison of liquid crystals, amorphous polymers, and semicrys-talline polymers in both melt and solid states is illustrated in Figure 15.20. There are 
three types of liquid crystals, based on orientation and positional ordering—smectic, nematic, and cholesteric; distinctions among these types are also beyond the scope of this discussion. The principal use of liquid crystal polymers is in liquid crystal displays ( LCDs) on 
digital watches, flat-panel computer monitors and televisions, and other digital displays. Here, cholesteric types of LCPs are used, which, at room temperature, are fluid liquids, transparent, and optically anisotropic. The displays are composed of two sheets of glass between which is sandwiched the liquid crystal material. The outer face of each glass sheet is coated with a transparent and electrically conductive film; in addition, the character-forming number/letter elements are etched into this film on the side that is to be viewed. A voltage applied through the conductive films (and thus between these two glass sheets) over one of these character-forming regions causes a disruption of the orientation of the LCP molecules in this region, a darkening of this LCP material, and, in turn, the formation of a visible character. Some of the nematic type of liquid crystal polymers are rigid solids at room tem-perature and, on the basis of an outstanding combination of properties and processing liquid crystal

characteristics, have found widespread use in a variety of commercial applications. For 
example, these materials exhibit the following behaviors:
 1. Excellent thermal stability; they may be used to temperatures as high as 230°C 
(450°F).
 2. Stiffness and strength; their tensile moduli range between 10 and 24 GPa (1.4 ×  106 
and 3.5 ×  106 psi), and their tensile strengths are from 125 to 255 MPa (18,000 to 
37,000 psi).
 3. High impact strengths, which are retained upon cooling to relatively low 
temperatures.
 4. Chemical inertness to a wide variety of acids, solvents, bleaches, and so on.
 5. Inherent flame resistance and combustion products that are relatively nontoxic.
The thermal stability and chemical inertness of these materials are explained by  extremely 
high intermolecular forces.
 The following may be said about their processing and fabrication characteristics:
 1. All conventional processing techniques available for thermoplastic materials may 
be used.
 2. Extremely low shrinkage and warpage take place during molding.
 3. There is exceptional dimensional repeatability from part to part. 4. Melt viscosity is low, which permits molding of thin sections and/or complex 
shapes.
 5. Heats of fusion are low; this results in rapid melting and subsequent cooling, 
which shortens molding cycle times.
 6. They have anisotropic finished-part properties; molecular orientation effects are 
produced from melt flow during molding.
 These materials are used extensively by the electronics industry (in interconnect 
devices, relay and capacitor housings, brackets, etc.), by the medical equipment industry (in components that are sterilized repeatedly), and in photocopiers and fiber-optic components.
Thermoplastic Elastomers
Thermoplastic elastomers ( TPEs or TEs) are a type of polymeric material that, at ambient 
conditions, exhibits elastomeric (or rubbery) behavior yet is thermoplastic (Section 14.9). By way of contrast, most elastomers heretofore discussed are thermosets because they are crosslinked during vulcanization. Of the several varieties of TPEs, one of the best known and widely used is a block copolymer consisting of block segments of a hard and rigid ther-moplastic (commonly styrene [S]) that alternate with block segments of a soft and flexible elastic material (often butadiene [B] or isoprene [I]). For a common TPE, hard, polymerized segments are located at chain ends, whereas each soft, central region consists of polymerized butadiene or isoprene units. These TPEs are frequently termed styrenic block copolymers;  
chain chemistries for the two (S-B-S and S-I-S) types are shown in Figure 15.21. At ambient temperatures, the soft, amorphous, central (butadiene or isoprene) segments impart rubbery, elastomeric behavior to the material. Furthermore, for tem-peratures below the T
m of the hard (styrene) component, hard chain-end segments from 
numerous adjacent chains aggregate together to form rigid crystalline domain regions. These domains are physical crosslinks that act as anchor points so as to restrict soft-
chain segment motions; they function in much the same way as chemical crosslinks for 
the thermoset elastomers. A schematic illustration for the structure of this TPE type is presented in Figure 15.22.thermoplastic 
 elastomer
548  •   Chapter 15  /  Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers
 The tensile modulus of this TPE material is subject to alteration; increasing the 
number of soft-component blocks per chain leads to a decrease in modulus and, there-fore, a decrease of stiffness. Furthermore, the useful temperature range lies between T
g of the soft, flexible component and Tm of the hard, rigid one. For the styrenic block 
copolymers, this range is between about −70°C (−95°F) and 100°C (212°F).
 In addition to the styrenic block copolymers, there are other types of TPEs, includ-ing thermoplastic olefins, copolyesters, thermoplastic polyurethanes, and elastomeric polyamides. The chief advantage of the TPEs over the thermoset elastomers is that upon heat-ing above T
m of the hard phase, they melt (i.e., the physical crosslinks disappear), and, 
therefore, they may be processed by conventional thermoplastic forming techniques [blow molding, injection molding, etc. (Section 15.23)]; thermoset polymers do not ex-perience melting, and, consequently, forming is normally more difficult. Furthermore, because the melting–solidification process is reversible and repeatable for thermoplastic elastomers, TPE parts may be reformed into other shapes. In other words, they are recyclable; thermoset elastomers are, to a large degree, nonrecyclable. Scrap that is generated during forming procedures may also be recycled, which results in lower pro-duction costs than with thermosets. In addition, tighter controls may be maintained on part dimensions for TPEs, and TPEs have lower densities.Figure 15.21

 In quite a variety of applications, thermoplastic elastomers have replaced conven-
tional thermoset elastomers. Typical uses for TPEs include automotive exterior trim (bumpers, fascia, etc.), automotive underhood components (electrical insulation and connectors, and gaskets), shoe soles and heels, sporting goods (e.g., bladders for foot-balls and soccer balls), medical barrier films and protective coatings, and components in sealants, caulking, and adhesives.
Polymer Synthesis and Processing
The large macromolecules of the commercially useful polymers must be synthe-sized from substances having smaller molecules in a process termed polymerization. Furthermore, the properties of a polymer may be modified and enhanced by the inclu-sion of additive materials. Finally, a finished piece having a desired shape must be fash-ioned during a forming operation. This section treats polymerization processes and the various forms of additives, as well as specific forming procedures.
The synthesis of these large molecules (polymers) is termed polymerization; it is simply the process by which monomers are linked together to generate long chains composed of repeat units. Most generally, the raw materials for synthetic polymers are derived from coal, natural gas, and petroleum products. The reactions by which polymerization occur are grouped into two general classifications—addition and condensation—according to the reaction mechanism, as discussed next.
Addition Polymerization
Addition polymerization (sometimes called chain reaction polymerization) is a process by which monomer units are attached one at a time in chainlike fashion to form a linear macromolecule. The composition of the resultant product molecule is an exact multiple of that of the original reactant monomer. Three distinct stages—initiation, propagation, and termination—are involved in  addition polymerization. During the initiation step, an active center capable of propaga-tion is formed by a reaction between an initiator (or catalyst) species and the monomer unit. This process has already been demonstrated for polyethylene in Equation 14.1, which is repeated as follows:

R· represents the active initiator, and · is an unpaired electron.
 Propagation involves the linear growth of the polymer chain by the sequential addi-tion of monomer units to this active growing chain molecule. This may be represented, again for polyethylene, as follows:

 Molecular weight is governed by the relative rates of initiation, propagation, and termination. Typically, they are controlled to ensure the production of a polymer having the desired degree of polymerization. Addition polymerization is used in the synthesis of polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), and polystyrene, as well as many of the copolymers.

Condensation Polymerization
Condensation (or step reaction) polymerization is the formation of polymers by step-
wise intermolecular chemical reactions that may involve more than one monomer 
species. There is usually a low-molecular-weight by-product such as water that is eliminated (or condensed). No reactant species has the chemical formula of the repeat unit, and the intermolecular reaction occurs every time a repeat unit is formed. For example, consider the formation of the polyester poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) from the reaction between dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol to form a linear condensation

follows:
This stepwise process is successively repeated, producing a linear molecule. Reaction times 
for condensation polymerization are generally longer than for addition polymerization. For the previous condensation reaction, both ethylene glycol and dimethyl tere-phthalate are bifunctional. However, condensation reactions can include trifunctional or higher functional monomers capable of forming crosslinked and network polymers. The thermosetting polyesters and phenol-formaldehyde, the nylons, and the polycarbonates are produced by condensation polymerization. Some polymers, such as nylon, may be polymerized by either technique.

Most of the properties of polymers discussed earlier in this chapter are intrinsic ones—
that is, they are characteristic of or fundamental to the specific polymer. Some of these properties are related to and controlled by the molecular structure. Often, however, it is necessary to modify the mechanical, chemical, and physical properties to a much greater degree than is possible by the simple alteration of this fundamental molecular structure. Foreign substances called additives are intentionally introduced to enhance or modify 
many of these properties and thus render a polymer more serviceable. Typical additives include filler materials, plasticizers, stabilizers, colorants, and flame retardants.
Fillers
Filler materials are most often added to polymers to improve tensile and compressive strengths, abrasion resistance, toughness, dimensional and thermal stability, and other filler15.22 POLYMER ADDITIVESEthylene glycol

Stabilizers
Some polymeric materials, under normal environmental conditions, are subject to rapid 
deterioration, generally in terms of mechanical integrity. Additives that counteract deteriorative processes are called stabilizers.
 One common form of deterioration results from exposure to light [in particular, 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation]. Ultraviolet radiation interacts with and causes a severance of some of the covalent bonds along the molecular chains, which may also result in some crosslinking. There are two primary approaches to UV stabilization. The first is to add a UV-absorbent material, often as a thin layer at the surface. This essentially acts as a sunscreen and blocks out the UV radiation before it can penetrate into and damage the polymer. The second approach is to add materials that react with the bonds broken by UV radiation before they can participate in other reactions that lead to additional polymer damage. Another important type of deterioration is oxidation (Section 17.12). It is a conse-quence of the chemical interaction between oxygen [as either diatomic oxygen (O
2) or 
ozone (O3)] and the polymer molecules. Stabilizers that protect against oxidation con-
sume oxygen before it reaches the polymer and/or prevent the occurrence of oxidation reactions that would further damage the material.
Colorants
Colorants impart a specific color to a polymer; they may be added in the form of dyes or pigments. The molecules in a dye actually dissolve in the polymer. Pigments are filler materials that do not dissolve but remain as a separate phase; normally, they have a small particle size and a refractive index near that of the parent polymer. Others may impart opacity as well as color to the polymer.stabilizer
colorantproperties. Materials used as particulate fillers include wood flour (finely powdered 
sawdust), silica flour and sand, glass, clay, talc, limestone, and even some synthetic poly-mers. Particle sizes range from 10 nm to macroscopic dimensions. Polymers that contain fillers may also be classified as composite materials, which are discussed in Chapter 16. Often the fillers are inexpensive materials that replace some volume of the more expen-sive polymer, reducing the cost of the final product.
Plasticizers
The flexibility, ductility, and toughness of polymers may be improved with the aid of additives called plasticizers.  Their presence also produces reductions in hardness and 
stiffness. Plasticizers are generally liquids with low vapor pressures and low molecular weights. The small plasticizer molecules occupy positions between the large polymer chains, effectively increasing the interchain distance with a reduction in the secondary intermolecular bonding. Plasticizers are commonly used in polymers that are intrinsically brittle at room temperature, such as poly(vinyl chloride) and some of the acetate copoly-mers. The plasticizer lowers the glass transition temperature, so that at ambient condi-tions the polymers may be used in applications requiring some degree of pliability and ductility. These applications include thin sheets or films, tubing, raincoats, and curtains.plasticizer

15.23 Forming Techniques for Plastics  •   553
Flame Retardants
The flammability of polymeric materials is a major concern, especially in the manufac-
ture of textiles and children’s toys. Most polymers are flammable in their pure form; exceptions include those containing significant contents of chlorine and/or fluorine, such as poly(vinyl chloride) and polytetrafluoroethylene. The flammability resistance of the remaining combustible polymers may be enhanced by additives called flame retardants. 
These retardants may function by interfering with the combustion process through the gas phase or by initiating a different combustion reaction that generates less heat, thereby reducing the temperature; this causes a slowing or cessation of burning.
flame retardant
Quite a variety of different techniques are employed in the forming of polymeric ma-terials. The method used for a specific polymer depends on several factors: (1) whether the material is thermoplastic or thermosetting; (2) if thermoplastic, the temperature at which it softens; (3) the atmospheric stability of the material being formed; and (4) the geometry and size of the finished product. There are numerous similarities between some of these techniques and those used for fabricating metals and ceramics. Fabrication of polymeric materials normally occurs at elevated temperatures and often by the application of pressure. Thermoplastics are formed above their glass transi-tion temperatures, if amorphous, or above their melting temperatures, if semicrystalline. An applied pressure must be maintained as the piece is cooled so that the formed article retains its shape. One significant economic benefit of using thermoplastics is that they may be recycled; scrap thermoplastic pieces may be remelted and re-formed into new shapes. Fabrication of thermosetting polymers is typically accomplished in two stages. First comes the preparation of a linear polymer (sometimes called a prepolymer) as a liquid 
having a low molecular weight. This material is converted into the final hard and stiff product during the second stage, which is normally carried out in a mold having the de-sired shape. This second stage, termed curing, may occur during heating and/or by the addition of catalysts and often under pressure. During curing, chemical and structural changes occur on a molecular level: a crosslinked or a network structure forms. After curing, thermoset polymers may be removed from a mold while still hot because they are now dimensionally stable. Thermosets are difficult to recycle, do not melt, are usable at higher temperatures than thermoplastics, and are often more chemically inert. Molding is the most common method for forming plastic polymers. The several 
molding techniques used include compression, transfer, blow, injection, and extrusion molding. For each, a finely pelletized or granulized plastic is forced, at an elevated tem-perature and by pressure, to flow into, fill, and assume the shape of a mold cavity.
Compression and Transfer Molding
For compression molding, the appropriate amounts of thoroughly mixed polymer and necessary additives are placed between male and female mold members, as illustrated in Figure 15.23. Both mold pieces are heated; however, only one is movable. The mold is closed, and heat and pressure are applied, causing the plastic to become viscous and flow to conform to the mold shape. Before molding, raw materials may be mixed and cold-pressed into a disk, which is called a preform . Preheating of the preform reduces molding 
time and pressure, extends die lifetime, and produces a more uniform finished piece. This molding technique lends itself to the fabrication of both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers; however, its use with thermoplastics is more time-consuming and expensive than the more commonly used extrusion or injection molding techniques discussed next. In transfer molding—a variation of compression molding—the solid ingredients are first melted in a heated transfer chamber. As the molten material is injected into the mold chamber, the pressure is distributed more uniformly over all surfaces. This process is used with thermosetting polymers and for pieces having complex geometries.molding15.23 FORMING TECHNIQUES FOR PLASTICS
554  •   Chapter 15  /  Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers
Injection Molding
Injection molding—the polymer analogue of die casting for metals—is the most widely 
used technique for fabricating thermoplastic materials. A schematic cross section of the apparatus used is illustrated in Figure 15.24. The correct amount of pelletized material is fed from a feed hopper into a cylinder by the motion of a plunger or ram. This charge is pushed forward into a heating chamber, where it is forced around a spreader so as to make better contact with the heated wall. As a result, the thermoplastic material melts to form a viscous liquid. Next, the molten plastic is impelled, again by ram motion, through a nozzle into the enclosed mold cavity; pressure is maintained until the molding has solidified. Finally, the mold is opened, the piece is ejected, the mold is closed, and the entire cycle is repeated. Probably the most outstanding feature of this technique is the speed with which pieces may be produced. For thermoplastics, solidification of the injected charge is almost immediate; consequently, cycle times for this process are short (commonly within the range of 10 to 30 s). Thermosetting polymers may also be injection molded; curing takes place while the material is under pressure in a heated mold, which results in longer cycle times than for thermoplastics. This process is sometimes termed reaction injection molding (RIM) and is commonly used for materials such as polyurethane.
Extrusion
The extrusion process is the molding of a viscous thermoplastic under pressure through an open-ended die, similar to the extrusion of metals (Figure 11.9 c). A mechanical screw 
or auger propels the pelletized material through a chamber, where it is successively compacted, melted, and formed into a continuous charge of viscous fluid (Figure 15.25). Extrusion takes place as this molten mass is forced through a die orifice. Solidification of the extruded length is expedited by blowers, a water spray, or a bath. The technique is especially adapted to producing continuous lengths having constant cross-sectional geometries—for example, rods, tubes, hose channels, sheets, and filaments.

15.25 Fabrication of Fibers and Films  •   555
Blow Molding
The blow-molding process for the fabrication of plastic containers is similar to that used for 
blowing glass bottles, as represented in Figure 13.15. First, a parison, or length of polymer 
tubing, is extruded. While still in a semimolten state, the parison is placed in a two-piece mold having the desired container configuration. The hollow piece is formed by blowing air or steam under pressure into the parison, forcing the tube walls to conform to the contours of the mold. The temperature and viscosity of the parison must be regulated carefully.
Casting
Like metals, polymeric materials may be cast, as when a molten plastic material is poured into a mold and allowed to solidify. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting plas-tics may be cast. For thermoplastics, solidification occurs upon cooling from the molten state; however, for thermosets, hardening is a consequence of the actual polymerization or curing process, which is usually carried out at an elevated temperature.Figure 15.25  Schematic diagram of an extruder.Shaping die

Techniques used in the actual fabrication of rubber parts are essentially the same as those discussed for plastics as described previously—compression molding, extrusion, and so on. Furthermore, most rubber materials are vulcanized (Section 15.9), and some are reinforced with carbon black (Section 16.2).15.24 FABRICATION OF ELASTOMERS

Fibers
The process by which fibers are formed from bulk polymer material is termed spinning.  
Most often, fibers are spun from the molten state in a process called melt spinning. The 
material to be spun is first heated until it forms a relatively viscous liquid. Next, it is spinning15.25 FABRICATION OF FIBERS AND FILMS

AirTubing dieExtrudatepumped through a plate called a spinneret, which contains numerous small, typically 
round holes. As the molten material passes through each of these orifices, a single fiber 
is formed, which is rapidly solidified by cooling with air blowers or a water bath. The crystallinity of a spun fiber depends on its rate of cooling during spinning. The strength of fibers is improved by a postforming process called drawing, as discussed in Section 15.8. Again, drawing is simply the permanent mechanical elongation of a fiber in the direction of its axis. During this process, the molecular chains become oriented in the direction of drawing (Figure 15.13d ), such that the tensile strength, modulus of 
elasticity, and toughness are improved. The cross section of melt-spun, drawn fibers is nearly circular, and the properties are uniform throughout the cross section. Two other techniques that involve producing fibers from solutions of dissolved poly-mers are dry spinning and wet spinning. For dry spinning, the polymer is dissolved in a vola-
tile solvent. The polymer–solvent solution is then pumped through a spinneret into a heated zone; here the fibers solidify as the solvent evaporates. In wet spinning, the fibers are formed by passing a polymer–solvent solution through a spinneret directly into a second solvent, which causes the polymer fiber to come out of (i.e., precipitate from) the solution. For both techniques, a skin first forms on the surface of the fiber. Subsequently, some shrinkage oc-curs such that the fiber shrivels up (like a raisin); this leads to a very irregular cross-section profile, which causes the fiber to become stiffer (i.e., increases the modulus of elasticity).
Films
Many films are simply extruded through a thin die slit; this may be followed by a roll-ing (calendering) or drawing operation that serves to reduce thickness and improve strength. Alternatively, film may be blown: Continuous tubing is extruded through an annular die; then, by maintaining a carefully controlled positive gas pressure inside the tube and by drawing the film in the axial direction as it emerges from the die, the material expands around this trapped air bubble like a balloon (Figure 15.26). As a result, the wall thickness is continuously reduced to produce a thin cylindrical film that can be sealed at the end to make garbage bags or may be cut and laid flat to make a film. This is termed a biaxial drawing process and produces films that are strong in both stretching directions. Some of the newer films are produced by coextrusion —
that is, multilayers of more than one polymer type are extruded simultaneously.
15.26 3D Printing of Polymers  •   557
Many polymeric materials may be fabricated into useful shapes using 3D printing (addi-
tive manufacturing) techniques. The procedure for generating software files that deliver instructions to the printer is similar to that described in Section 11.7 (for 3D printing of metals). In general, polymers are more amenable to 3D printing than metals and ceram-ics because they (polymers)
 • have relatively low melting/softening temperatures
 • are relatively flexible and ductile
 • may be photosensitive (i.e., polymerize when exposed to a light source, often an ultravio-
let one)
 Several novel 3D printing techniques are used for polymeric materials; we will de-
scribe four of the most common—fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, polyjet printing, and continuous liquid interface production.
Fused Deposition Modeling
Fused deposition modeling (abbreviated FDM)8 was one of the first 3D printing tech-
niques developed for polymeric materials—specifically for thermoplastic polymers. With this technique, illustrated schematically in Figure 15.27, a filament or wire of the 
feedstock polymer is fed into the printer nozzle, which heats the polymer to above its glass transition temperature. Each layer of the desired object is formed by extrusion, from the nozzle, of a flattened string of the molten polymer; the printer software deter-mines locations where the nozzle is to “print” or distribute the polymer so as to generate the exact pattern for every layer. Adjacent layers of the semi-molten polymer adhere to one another; furthermore, shortly after extrusion, the polymer hardens upon cooling. For some complex shapes, it may be necessary to also print scaffoldings during the build process to support portions of the object that may warp or collapse during printing and while the polymer is still semi-molten. A different polymer [for example, 15.26 3D PRINTING OF POLYMERS

(or FFF); sometimes this technique is also called plastic jet printing (PJP).Object/ModelMaterial spool

poly(vinyl alcohol)] is printed for these support structures, which is removed, post-
processing, by dissolution in a water–detergent bath. Common polymers printed using this FDM technique include poly(lactic acid) (PLA), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), nylon, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and polycarbonate (PC). One important application of FDM-printed polymers is biodegradable PLA scaffolds for biomedical tissue engineering. Other application areas include aerospace, medical packaging, elec-tronics (static-sensitive materials), and in the production of prototypes.
Stereolithography
The technique of stereolithographic ( SLA) 3D printing of polymers is similar to the 
SLA process described in Section 13.15 (Figure 13.27) for ceramics—except that the polymer resin does not contain a suspension of ceramic particles. The photosensitive resin mixture is composed of the polymer to be printed, monomers (that influence the viscosity of the feedstock), and, in addition, photoinitiators that cause the resin mixture to cure (polymerize) when exposed to light. The object being created is attached to and supported by a build platform that may be transported up or down. The build platform and partially-printed object are immersed in a vat of the liquid photosensitive resin; the top object layer is positioned at the surface of the resin bath. The next layer (or slice) is created by first lowering the build platform and object a distance equal to a layer thickness (typically 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm); a thin coating of the next layer is then applied using a resin-filled blade that sweeps across the surface. A laser beam then scans (or draws) the pattern for this layer of the object onto this new polymer resin coating such that only scanned regions polymerize (crosslink and solidify) and become joined to the layer below. This process is repeated until, layer by layer, the complete object has been polymerized, at which time the object is removed from the vat and all uncured resin is washed away by immersion in a chemical bath. Finally, the desired object may then be subjected to a post-printing treatment in an ultraviolet oven so as to achieve complete polymerization. Polymers fabricated using stereolithography are thermosetting inasmuch as the cured material is crosslinked or forms a network; the most common of these are epoxy- and acrylate-based systems. Furthermore, typical applications include anatomical models, custom-fitting biomedical implants, architectural models, and investment casting patterns.
Polyjet Printing
The polyjet printing ( PJP) (sometimes also called photopolymer jetting) technique 
incorporates elements of both fused deposition modeling and stereolithography, discussed previously—on a build platform, a head prints the object one layer at a time (as with the FDM process) using a UV-active and viscous liquid photopolymer (as with SLA), which is immediately cured with an ultraviolet lamp. However, unlike SLA, the object being printed is not immersed in a photopolymer bath. The printing of support structures may also be necessary for overhanging elements of the object— usually of a different material—which are washed away, post-printing, using a high-pressure stream of water. The photopolymer cures very rapidly and, therefore, a post-cure treatment is not necessary. Using this technique, it is possible, by blending, to simultaneously print two or three resins; this leads to the creation of composites, a range of colors, transparent objects, multicolored objects, and functionally graded materials (i.e., having different proper-ties at different locations). Printed materials are proprietary; however, they are mar-keted in terms of conventional polymers whose properties they “mimic”—for example, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polypropylene (PP), and polycarbonate (PC). 
15.26 3D Printing of Polymers  •   559
Alternatively, these materials may be characterized by a specific property—for example, 
biocompatible, transparent, or exhibiting rubberlike behavior. Applications are many and varied—for example, dental and orthodontic models, glasses/eyewear, handles, gas-kets, mobile phone casings, casting patterns, and surgical guides.
Continuous Liquid Interface Production
The distinguishing feature of continuous liquid interface production (or CLIP) is the 
speed at which it prints objects. Whereas other 3D printing techniques create objects layer by layer, the CLIP process is continuous in that a build platform progressively lifts the forming object out of a liquid resin bath (Figure 15.28). This continuous liquid interface production is achieved by the creation of successive and imperceptibly thin cross sections of the object, very rapidly, within the resin. An ultraviolet light projec-tor located beneath the bath projects the cross-sectional silhouette image onto a very thin layer of liquid resin; the UV light cures (polymerizes or hardens) just this thin 
cross sec tion. Furthermore, an oxygen-permeable window located near the bottom of 
the bath admits a very thin layer of oxygen that creates a “dead zone,” which is located above the window; resin within this zone is prevented from polymerizing when UV light passes through it—polymerization occurs only immediately above this zone, at the projected image plane. As the build platform gradually pulls the forming object out of the bath, additional low-oxygen resin feeds toward the bottom, the UV light continues to project and cure successive layers, and the object grows progressively until completely formed. At this time, the object is thermally cured in a forced-circulation oven; this  process activates a secondary polymerization reaction that leads to improved 
 mechanical properties.
 A variety of polymers are printed using CLIP, to include the following:
 • Elastomeric polyurethane (EPU), which is highly elastic (over a wide temperature 
range), resilient, and tear-resistant. Typical applications include cushioning, gaskets, 
grommets, and watertight seals.
 • Rigid polyurethane (RPU), which is strong, stiff, abrasion resistant, and tough; it is 
used extensively in consumer electronics for computer mice, cell phones, other elec-tronic housings; and in automotive applications for brackets, ducts, and connectors.
 • Flexible polyurethane (FPU), which is flexible and resistant to impact, abrasion, and 
fatigue failure. It is used for hinging mechanisms, stress-bearing applications and for frictions fits—for example in toys, rigid packaging, and housewares.
 • Cyanate ester (CE), which is stiff and strong, and resistant to elevated temperature 
exposures with long-term thermal stability. It is used for automobile under-the-hood applications, electronics, and industrial components.ProjectorUV curable

SUMMARY
• On the basis of stress–strain behavior, polymers fall within three general classifica-
tions (Figure 15.1): brittle (curve A ), plastic (curve B ), and highly elastic (curve C ).
• Polymers are neither as strong nor as stiff as metals. However, their high flexibilities, 
low densities, and resistance to corrosion make them the materials of choice for many 
applications.
• The mechanical properties of polymers are sensitive to changes in temperature and 
strain rate. With either rising temperature or decreasing strain rate, modulus of elas-ticity diminishes, tensile strength decreases, and ductility increases.
• Viscoelastic mechanical behavior, intermediate between totally elastic and totally 
viscous, is displayed by a number of polymeric materials.
• This behavior is characterized by the relaxation modulus, a time-dependent modulus 
of elasticity.
• The magnitude of the relaxation modulus is very sensitive to temperature. Glassy, 
leathery, rubbery, and viscous flow regions may be identified on a plot of logarithm of relaxation modulus versus temperature (Figure 15.7).
• The logarithm of relaxation modulus versus temperature behavior depends on molecular 
configuration—degree of crystallinity, presence of crosslinking, and so on (Figure 15.8).
• Fracture strengths of polymeric materials are low relative to those of metals and 
 ceramics.
• Both brittle and ductile fracture modes are possible.
• Some thermoplastic materials experience a ductile-to-brittle transition with a lower-
ing of temperature, an increase in strain rate, and/or an alteration of specimen thick-
ness or geometry.
• In some thermoplastics, the crack-formation process may be preceded by crazing; 
crazes are regions of localized deformation and microvoids (Figure 15.9).
• Crazing can lead to an increase in ductility and toughness of the material.
• During the elastic deformation of a semicrystalline polymer having a spherulitic struc-
ture that is stressed in tension, the molecules in amorphous regions elongate in the 
stress direction (Figure 15.12).
• The tensile plastic deformation of spherulitic polymers occurs in several stages as 
both amorphous tie chains and chain-folded block segments (which separate from the ribbonlike lamellae) become oriented with the tensile axis (Figure 15.13).
• Also, during deformation the shapes of spherulites are altered (for moderate defor-
mations); relatively large degrees of deformation lead to a complete destruction of the spherulites and formation of highly aligned structures.
• The mechanical behavior of a polymer is influenced by both in-service and structural/
processing factors.
• Increasing the temperature and/or diminishing the strain rate leads to reductions in 
tensile modulus and tensile strength and an enhancement of ductility.
• Other factors affect the mechanical properties:
Molecular weight—Tensile modulus is relatively insensitive to molecular weight. 
However, tensile strength increases with increasing M
n (Equation 15.3).

Heat-treating—Heat-treating undrawn and semicrystalline polymers leads to in-
creases in stiffness and strength and a decrease in ductility.
• Large elastic extensions are possible for elastomeric materials that are amorphous 
and lightly crosslinked.
• Deformation corresponds to the unkinking and uncoiling of chains in response to an 
applied tensile stress.
• Crosslinking is often achieved during a vulcanization process; increased crosslinking 
enhances the modulus of elasticity and the tensile strength of the elastomer.
• Many elastomers are copolymers, whereas silicone elastomers are really inorganic 
materials.
• During the crystallization of a polymer, randomly oriented molecules in the liquid 
phase transform into chain-folded crystallites that have ordered and aligned molecu-
lar structures.
• The melting of crystalline regions of a polymer corresponds to the transformation of 
a solid material having an ordered structure of aligned molecular chains into a viscous liquid in which the structure is highly random.
• The glass transition occurs in amorphous regions of polymers.
• Upon cooling, this phenomenon corresponds to the gradual transformation from a 
liquid into a rubbery material, and finally into a rigid solid. With decreasing tempera-
ture there is a reduction in the motion of large segments of molecular chains.
• Melting and glass transition temperatures may be determined from plots of specific 
volume versus temperature (Figure 15.18).
• These parameters are important relative to the temperature range over which a par-
ticular polymer may be used and processed.
• The magnitudes of T
m and Tg increase with increasing chain stiffness; stiffness is enhanced 
by the presence of chain double bonds and side groups that are either bulky or polar.
• At low molecular weights Tm and Tg increase with increasing M.
• One way of classifying polymeric materials is according to their end use. With this 
scheme, the several types include plastics, fibers, coatings, adhesives, films, foams, and advanced materials.
• Plastic materials are perhaps the most widely used group of polymers and include the 
following: polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, and the fluorocarbons, epoxies, phenolics, and polyesters.
• Many polymeric materials may be spun into fibers, which are used primarily in textiles. 
Mechanical, thermal, and chemical characteristics of these materials are especially critical.
• Polymers find widespread use as biomaterials that are implanted into the body.  
Characteristics and applications of several synthetic and nonbiodegradable polymers were discussed.
• Three advanced polymeric materials were discussed: ultra-high-molecular-
weight polyethylene, liquid crystal polymers, and thermoplastic elastomers. These materials have unusual properties and are used in a host of high-technology applications.Deformation of

• Synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers is attained by polymerization, of which 
there are two types: addition and condensation.
For addition polymerization, monomer units are attached one at a time in chain-
like fashion to form a linear molecule.
Condensation polymerization involves stepwise intermolecular chemical reac-
tions that may include more than a single molecular species.
• The properties of polymers may be further modified by using additives; these include 
fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, colorants, and flame retardants.
Fillers are added to improve the strength, abrasion resistance, toughness, and/or 
thermal/dimensional stability of polymers.
Flexibility, ductility, and toughness are enhanced by the addition of plasticizers.
Stabilizers counteract deteriorative processes due to exposure to light and gase-
ous species in the atmosphere.
Colorants are used to impart specific colors to polymers.The flammability resistance of polymers is enhanced by the incorporation of 
flame retardants.
• Fabrication of plastic polymers is usually accomplished by shaping the material in 
molten form at an elevated temperature, using at least one of several different mold-ing techniques—compression (Figure 15.23), transfer, injection (Figure 15.24), and blow. Extrusion (Figure 15.25) and casting are also possible.
• Some fibers are spun from a viscous melt or solution, after which they are plastically 
elongated during a drawing operation, which improves the mechanical strength.
• Films are formed by extrusion and blowing (Figure 15.26) or by calendering.
• The properties of many polymers make them especially amenable to fabrication by 
3D printing—e.g., photosensitivity, flexibility, and low melting/softening temperatures.
• The following four 3D printing techniques were discussed for polymeric materials: 
fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, polyjet printing, and continuous liquid 
interface production.Polymerization

The advent of the composites as a distinct classification of materials began during the 
mid-20th century with the manufacturing of deliberately designed and engineered mul-tiphase composites such as fiberglass-reinforced polymers. Although multiphase ma-terials, such as wood, bricks made from straw-reinforced clay, seashells, and even alloys such as steel had been known for millennia, recognition of this novel concept of combin-ing dissimilar materials during manufacture led to the identification of composites as a new class that was separate from familiar metals, ceramics, and polymers. This concept of multiphase composites provides exciting opportunities for designing an exceedingly large variety of materials with property combinations that cannot be met by any of the monolithic conventional metal alloys, ceramics, and polymeric materials.

 Materials that have specific and unusual properties are needed for a host of high-technology applications such as those found in the aerospace, underwater, bioengineer-ing, and transportation industries. For example, aircraft engineers are increasingly searching for structural materials that have low densities; are strong, stiff, and abrasion and impact resistant; and do not easily corrode. This is a rather formidable combination of characteristics. Among monolithic materials, strong materials are relatively dense; increasing the strength or stiffness generally results in a decrease in toughness. Material property combinations and ranges have been, and are yet being, ex-tended by the development of composite materials. Generally speaking, a composite is considered to be any multiphase material that exhibits a significant proportion of the 16.1 INTRODUCTION5.  Compute longitudinal strengths for discontinu-

1By monolithic we mean having a microstructure that is uniform and continuous and was formed from a single ma-
terial; furthermore, more than one microconstituent may be present. In contrast, the microstructure of a composite is 
nonuniform, discontinuous, and multiphase, in the sense that it is a mixture of two or more distinct materials.With knowledge of the various types of composites, as 
well as an understanding of the dependence of their behaviors on the characteristics, relative amounts,  geometry/distribution, and properties of the con-stituent phases, it is possible to design materials with property combinations that are better than those found in any monolithic metal alloys, ceramics, and polymeric materials. For example, in Design Example 16.1, we discuss how a tubular shaft is designed that meets specified stiffness requirements.

properties of both constituent phases such that a better combination of properties is 
realized. According to this principle of combined action, better property combinations 
are fashioned by the judicious combination of two or more distinct materials. Property trade-offs are also made for many composites. Composites of sorts have already been discussed; these include multiphase metal alloys, ceramics, and polymers. For example, pearlitic steels (Section 9.19) have a microstructure consisting of alternating layers of 𝛼 -ferrite and cementite (Figure 9.27). 
The ferrite phase is soft and ductile, whereas cementite is hard and very brittle. The combined mechanical characteristics of the pearlite (reasonably high ductility and strength) are superior to those of either of the constituent phases. A number of composites also occur in nature. For example, wood consists of strong and flexible cellulose fibers surrounded and held together by a stiffer material called lignin. Also, bone is a composite of the strong yet soft protein collagen and the hard, brittle min-eral apatite. A composite, in the present context, is a multiphase material that is artificially made, as opposed to one that occurs or forms naturally. In addition, the constituent phases must be chemically dissimilar and separated by a distinct interface. In designing composite materials, scientists and engineers have ingeniously combined various metals, ceramics, and polymers to produce a new generation of extraordinary materials. Most composites have been created to improve combinations of  mechanical characteristics such as stiffness, toughness, and ambient and high-temperature strength. Many composite materials are composed of just two phases; one is termed the 
matrix, which is continuous and surrounds the other phase, often called the dispersed 
phase. The properties of composites are a function of the properties of the constituent 
phases, their relative amounts, and the geometry of the dispersed phase. Dispersed 
phase geometry in this context means the shape of the particles and the particle size, 
distribution, and orientation; these characteristics are represented in Figure 16.1.principle of

16.2 Large-Particle Composites  •   567
 One simple scheme for the classification of composite materials is shown in 
Figure 16.2, which consists of four main divisions: particle-reinforced, fiber- reinforced, 
structural, and nanocomposites. The dispersed phase for particle-reinforced  composites is equiaxed (i.e., particle dimensions are approximately the same in all 
directions); for fiber-reinforced composites, the dispersed phase has the geometry of a fiber (i.e., a large length-to-diameter ratio). Structural composites are multi-layered and designed to have low densities and high degrees of structural integrity. For nanocomposites, dimensions of the dispersed phase particles are on the order of nanometers. The discussion of the remainder of this chapter is organized according to this classification scheme.Figure 16.2  A classification

As noted in Figure 16.2, large-particle and dispersion-strengthened composites are the 
two subclassifications of particle-reinforced composites. The distinction between these is based on the reinforcement or strengthening mechanism. The term large is used to 
indicate that particle–matrix interactions cannot be treated on the atomic or molecular level; rather, continuum mechanics is used. For most of these composites, the par-ticulate phase is harder and stiffer than the matrix. These reinforcing particles tend to restrain movement of the matrix phase in the vicinity of each particle. In essence, the matrix transfers some of the applied stress to the particles, which bear a fraction of the load. The degree of reinforcement or improvement of mechanical behavior depends on strong bonding at the matrix–particle interface. For dispersion-strengthened composites, particles are normally much smaller, with  diameters between 0.01 and 0.1 μ m (10 and 100 nm). Particle–matrix interactions that 
lead to strengthening occur on the atomic or molecular level. The mechanism of strengthening is similar to that for precipitation hardening discussed in Section 11.10. Whereas the matrix bears the major portion of an applied load, the small dispersed par-ticles hinder or impede the motion of dislocations. Thus, plastic deformation is restricted such that yield and tensile strengths, as well as hardness, improve.large-particle

Some polymeric materials to which fillers have been added (Section 15.22) are really 
large-particle composites. Again, the fillers modify or improve the properties of the ma-terial and/or replace some of the polymer volume with a less expensive material—the filler.16.2 LARGE-PARTICLE COMPOSITES
568  •   Chapter 16  /  Composites
 Another familiar large-particle composite is concrete, which is composed of cement 
(the matrix) and sand and gravel (the particulates). Concrete is the discussion topic of a succeeding section. Particles can have quite a variety of geometries, but they should be of approxi-mately the same dimension in all directions (equiaxed). For effective reinforcement, the particles should be small and evenly distributed throughout the matrix. Furthermore, the volume fraction of the two phases influences the behavior; mechanical properties are enhanced with increasing particulate content. Two mathematical expressions have been formulated for the dependence of the elastic modulus on the volume fraction of the constituent phases for a two-phase composite. These rule-of-mixtures equations 
predict that the elastic modulus should fall between an upper bound represented by
 
Ec(u)=EmVm+EpVp (16.1)
and a lower bound, or limit,
 Ec(l)=EmEp
VmEp+VpEm (16.2)
In these expressions, E  and V  denote the elastic modulus and volume fraction, 
respectively, and the subscripts c, m, and p represent composite, matrix, and particulate 
phases, respectively. Figure 16.3 plots upper- and lower-bound Ec-versus-Vp curves for 
a copper–tungsten composite, in which tungsten is the particulate phase; experimental 
data points fall between the two curves. Equations analogous to 16.1 and 16.2 for fiber-reinforced composites are derived in Section 16.5. Large-particle composites are used with all three material types (metals, polymers, and ceramics). The cermets are examples of ceramic–metal composites. The most com-
mon cermet is cemented carbide, which is composed of extremely hard particles of a refractory carbide ceramic such as tungsten carbide (WC) or titanium carbide (TiC) embedded in a matrix of a metal such as cobalt or nickel. These composites are used extensively as cutting tools for hardened steels. The hard carbide particles provide the cutting surface but, being extremely brittle, are not capable of withstanding the cutting stresses. Toughness is enhanced by their inclusion in the ductile metal matrix, which isolates the carbide particles from one another and prevents particle-to-particle crack propagation. Both matrix and particulate phases are quite refractory to the high rule of mixtures

 temperatures generated by the cutting action on materials that are extremely hard. 
No single material could possibly provide the combination of properties possessed by a cermet. Relatively large volume fractions of the particulate phase may be used, often exceeding 90 vol%; thus the abrasive action of the composite is maximized. A photomi-crograph of a WC–Co cemented carbide is shown in Figure 16.4. Both elastomers and plastics are frequently reinforced with various particulate materials. Use of many modern rubbers would be severely restricted without reinforc-ing particulate materials such as carbon black . Carbon black consists of very small and 
essentially spherical particles of carbon, produced by the combustion of natural gas or oil in an atmosphere that has only a limited air supply. When added to vulcanized rubber, this extremely inexpensive material enhances tensile strength, toughness, and tear and abrasion resistance. Automobile tires contain on the order of 15 to 30 vol% carbon black. For the carbon black to provide significant reinforcement, the particle size must be extremely small, with diameters between 20 and 50 nm; also, the particles must be evenly distributed throughout the rubber and must form a strong adhesive bond with the rubber matrix. Particle reinforcement using other materials (e.g., silica) is much less effective because this special interaction between the rubber molecules and particle surfaces does not exist. Figure 16.5 is an electron micrograph of a carbon black–reinforced rubber.

interchanged, it is appropriate to make a distinction between them. In a broad sense, con-
crete implies a composite material consisting of an aggregate of particles that are bound together in a solid body by some type of binding medium, that is, a cement. The two most familiar concretes are those made with Portland and asphaltic cements, in which the aggregate is gravel and sand. Asphaltic concrete is widely used primarily as a paving  material, whereas Portland cement concrete is employed extensively as a structural building material. Only the latter is treated in this discussion.
Portland Cement Concrete
 The ingredients for this concrete are Portland cement, a fine aggregate (sand), a coarse aggregate (gravel), and water. The process by which Portland cement is produced and the mechanism of setting and hardening were discussed very briefly in Section 13.7. The aggregate particles act as a filler material to reduce the overall cost of the concrete product because they are cheap, whereas cement is relatively expensive. To achieve the optimum strength and workability of a concrete mixture, the ingredients must be added in the correct proportions. Dense packing of the aggregate and good interfacial contact are achieved by having particles of two different sizes; the fine particles of sand should fill the void spaces between the gravel particles. Typically, these aggregates constitute between 60% and 80% of the total volume. The amount of cement–water paste should be sufficient to coat all the sand and gravel particles; otherwise, the cementitious bond will be incom-plete. Furthermore, all of the constituents should be thoroughly mixed. Complete bonding between cement and the aggregate particles is contingent on the addition of the correct quantity of water. Too little water leads to incomplete bonding, and too much results in excessive porosity; in either case, the final strength is less than the optimum. The character of the aggregate particles is an important consideration. In particu-lar, the size distribution of the aggregates influences the amount of cement–water paste required. Also, the surfaces should be clean and free from clay and silt, which prevent the formation of a sound bond at the particle surface. Portland cement concrete is a major material of construction, primarily because it can be poured in place and hardens at room temperature and even when submerged in water. However, as a structural material, it has some limitations and disadvantages. Like most ceramics, Portland cement concrete is relatively weak and extremely brittle; its ten-sile strength is approximately one-fifteenth to one-tenth its compressive strength. Also, large concrete structures can experience considerable thermal expansion and contraction with temperature fluctuations. In addition, water penetrates into external pores, which can cause severe cracking in cold weather as a consequence of freeze–thaw cycles. Most of these inadequacies may be eliminated or at least reduced by reinforcement and/or the incorporation of additives.
Reinforced Concrete
 The strength of Portland cement concrete may be increased by additional rein-forcement. This is usually accomplished by means of steel rods, wires, bars (rebar), or mesh, which are embedded into the fresh and uncured concrete. Thus, the reinforcement renders the hardened structure capable of supporting greater tensile, compressive, and shear stresses. Even if cracks develop in the concrete, considerable reinforcement is maintained. Steel serves as a suitable reinforcement material because its coefficient of thermal expansion is nearly the same as that of concrete. In addition, steel is not rapidly cor-roded in the cement environment, and a relatively strong adhesive bond is formed between it and the cured concrete. This adhesion may be enhanced by the incorpora-tion of contours into the surface of the steel member, which permits a greater degree of mechanical interlocking.
16.3 Dispersion-Strengthened Composites  •   571
 Portland cement concrete may also be reinforced by mixing fibers of a high-modulus 
material such as glass, steel, nylon, or polyethylene into the fresh concrete. Care must be exercised in using this type of reinforcement because some fiber materials experience rapid deterioration when exposed to the cement environment. Another reinforcement technique for strengthening concrete involves the introduc-tion of residual compressive stresses into the structural member; the resulting material is called prestressed concrete.  This method uses one characteristic of brittle ceramics—
namely, that they are stronger in compression than in tension. Thus, to fracture a pre-stressed concrete member, the magnitude of the precompressive stress must be exceeded by an applied tensile stress. In one such prestressing technique, high-strength steel wires are positioned inside the empty molds and stretched with a high tensile force, which is maintained constant. After the concrete has been placed and allowed to harden, the tension is released. As the wires contract, they put the structure in a state of compression because the stress is transmitted to the concrete via the concrete–wire bond that is formed. Another technique, in which stresses are applied after the concrete hardens, is ap-propriately called posttensioning. Sheet metal or rubber tubes are situated inside and pass through the concrete forms, around which the concrete is cast. After the cement has hardened, steel wires are fed through the resulting holes, and tension is applied to the wires by means of jacks attached and abutted to the faces of the structure. Again, a compressive stress is imposed on the concrete piece, this time by the jacks. Finally, the empty spaces inside the tubing are filled with a grout to protect the wire from corrosion. Concrete that is prestressed should be of high quality with low shrinkage and low creep rate. Prestressed concretes, usually prefabricated, are commonly used for highway and railway bridges.
prestressed concrete
Metals and metal alloys may be strengthened and hardened by the uniform dispersion of several volume percent of fine particles of a very hard and inert material. The dis-persed phase may be metallic or nonmetallic; oxide materials are often used. Again, the strengthening mechanism involves interactions between the particles and dislocations within the matrix, as with precipitation hardening. The dispersion strengthening effect is not as pronounced as with precipitation hardening; however, the strengthening is retained at elevated temperatures and for extended time periods because the dispersed particles are chosen to be unreactive with the matrix phase. For precipitation-hardened alloys, the increase in strength may disappear upon heat treatment as a consequence of precipitate growth or dissolution of the precipitate phase. The high-temperature strength of nickel alloys may be enhanced significantly by the addition of about 3 vol% thoria (ThO
2) as finely dispersed particles; this material is 
known as thoria-dispersed (or TD) nickel. The same effect is produced in the aluminum–aluminum oxide system. A very thin and adherent alumina coating is caused to form on the surface of extremely small (0.1 to 0.2 μm thick) flakes of aluminum, which are 
dispersed within an aluminum metal matrix; this material is termed sintered aluminum 
powder (SAP).16.3 DISPERSION-STRENGTHENED COMPOSITES

572  •   Chapter 16  /  Composites
Technologically, the most important composites are those in which the dispersed phase 
is in the form of a fiber. Design goals of fiber-reinforced composites often include high 
strength and/or stiffness on a weight basis. These characteristics are expressed in terms of specific strength and specific modulus parameters, which correspond, respectively, to 
the ratios of tensile strength to specific gravity and modulus of elasticity to specific grav-ity. Fiber-reinforced composites with exceptionally high specific strengths and moduli have been produced that use low-density fiber and matrix materials. As noted in Figure 16.2, fiber-reinforced composites are subclassified by fiber length. For short-fiber composites, the fibers are too short to produce a significant im-provement in strength.fiber-reinforced 
 composite
specific strength
specific modulusFiber-Reinforced Composites
The mechanical characteristics of a fiber-reinforced composite depend not only on the 
properties of the fiber, but also on the degree to which an applied load is transmitted to the fibers by the matrix phase. Important to the extent of this load transmittance is the magnitude of the interfacial bond between the fiber and matrix phases. Under an applied stress, this fiber–matrix bond ceases at the fiber ends, yielding a matrix defor-mation pattern as shown schematically in Figure 16.6; in other words, there is no load transmittance from the matrix at each fiber extremity. Some critical fiber length is necessary for effective strengthening and stiffening of the composite material. This critical length l
c is dependent on the fiber diameter d and 
its ultimate (or tensile) strength 𝜎*f and on the fiber–matrix bond strength (or the shear 
yield strength of the matrix, whichever is smaller) 𝜏c according to
 lc=𝜎*fd
2𝜏c (16.3)
For a number of glass and carbon fiber–matrix combinations, this critical length is on the order of 1 mm, which ranges between 20 and 150 times the fiber diameter. When a stress equal to 𝜎
*f is applied to a fiber having just this critical length, the 
stress–position profile shown in Figure 16.7 a results—that is, the maximum fiber load is 
achieved only at the axial center of the fiber. As fiber length l increases, the fiber rein-
forcement becomes more effective; this is demonstrated in Figure 16.7 b, a stress–axial 
position profile for l  > lc when the applied stress is equal to the fiber strength. Figure 16.7c 
shows the stress–position profile for l < lc.
 Fibers for which l≫lc (normally l  > 15lc) are termed continuous; discontinuous  
or short fibers  have lengths shorter than this. For discontinuous fibers of lengths signifi-
cantly less than lc, the matrix deforms around the fiber such that there is virtually no Critical fiber

The arrangement or orientation of the fibers relative to one another, the fiber concen-tration, and the distribution all have a significant influence on the strength and other properties of fiber-reinforced composites. With respect to orientation, two extremes are possible: (1) a parallel alignment of the longitudinal axis of the fibers in a single direc-tion, and (2) a totally random alignment. Continuous fibers are normally aligned (Figure 16.8a), whereas discontinuous fibers may be aligned (Figure 16.8 b), randomly oriented 
(Figure 16.8c), or partially oriented. Better overall composite properties are realized when the fiber distribution is uniform.
Continuous and Aligned Fiber Composites
Tensile Stress–Strain Behavior—Longitudinal Loading
 Mechanical responses of this type of composite depend on several factors, includ-ing the stress–strain behaviors of fiber and matrix phases, the phase volume fractions and the direction in which the stress or load is applied. Furthermore, the properties of a composite having its fibers aligned are highly anisotropic, that is, they depend on the direction in which they are measured. Let us first consider the stress–strain behavior for the situation in which the stress is applied along the direction of alignment, the longitu-
dinal direction, which is indicated in Figure 16.8a.

574  •   Chapter 16  /  Composites
 To begin, assume the stress-versus-strain behaviors for fiber and matrix phases that 
are represented schematically in Figure 16.9 a; in this treatment we consider the fiber to 
be totally brittle and the matrix phase to be reasonably ductile. Also indicated in this figure are fracture strengths in tension for fiber and matrix, 𝜎
*f, and 𝜎m*, respectively, and 
their corresponding fracture strains, 𝜀*f, and 𝜀*m; furthermore, it is assumed that 𝜀*m>𝜀*f, 
which is normally the case. A fiber-reinforced composite consisting of these fiber and matrix materials exhib-its the uniaxial stress–strain response illustrated in Figure 16.9 b; the fiber and matrix Figure 16.8  Schematic representations of

behaviors from Figure 16.9a are included to provide perspective. In the initial Stage I 
region, both fibers and matrix deform elastically; normally this portion of the curve is linear. Typically, for a composite of this type, the matrix yields and deforms plastically (at 𝜀
ym, Figure 16.9b) while the fibers continue to stretch elastically, inasmuch as the 
tensile strength of the fibers is significantly higher than the yield strength of the matrix. This process constitutes Stage II as noted in the figure; this stage is typically very nearly linear but of diminished slope relative to Stage I. In passing from Stage I to Stage II, the proportion of the applied load borne by the fibers increases. The onset of composite failure begins as the fibers start to fracture, which cor-responds to a strain of approximately 𝜀
*f as noted in Figure 16.9b . Composite failure 
is not catastrophic for a couple of reasons. First, not all fibers fracture at the same time, because there will always be considerable variations in the fracture strength of brittle fiber materials (Section 12.8). In addition, even after fiber failure, the matrix is still intact inasmuch as 𝜀
*f<𝜀*m (Figure 16.9a ). Thus, these fractured fibers, which 
are shorter than the original ones, are still embedded within the intact matrix and consequently are capable of sustaining a diminished load as the matrix continues to plastically deform.
Elastic Behavior—Longitudinal Loading
 Let us now consider the elastic behavior of a continuous and oriented fibrous compos-ite that is loaded in the direction of fiber alignment. First, it is assumed that the fiber–matrix interfacial bond is very good, such that deformation of both matrix and fibers is the same (an isostrain situation). Under these conditions, the total load sustained by the composite 
F
c is equal to the sum of the loads carried by the matrix phase Fm and the fiber phase Ff, or
 Fc=Fm+Ff (16.4)
From the definition of stress, Equation 6.1, F = 𝜎A; thus expressions for Fc, Fm, and Ff in 
terms of their respective stresses (𝜎c, 𝜎m, and 𝜎f) and cross-sectional areas (Ac, Am, and 
Af) are possible. Substitution of these into Equation 16.4 yields
 𝜎cAc=𝜎mAm+𝜎fAf (16.5)
Dividing through by the total cross-sectional area of the composite, Ac, we have
 𝜎c=𝜎mAm
Ac+𝜎fAf
Ac (16.6)
where Am/Ac and Af/Ac are the area fractions of the matrix and fiber phases, respec-
tively. If the composite, matrix, and fiber phase lengths are all equal, Am/Ac is equiva-
lent to the volume fraction of the matrix, Vm, and likewise for the fibers, Vf = Af /Ac. 
Equation 16.6 becomes
 𝜎c=𝜎mVm+𝜎fVf (16.7)
 The previous assumption of an isostrain state means that 𝜀
c=𝜀m=𝜀f (16.8)
and when each term in Equation 16.7 is divided by its respective strain,
 𝜎c
𝜀c=𝜎m
𝜀mVm+𝜎f
𝜀fVf (16.9)
Furthermore, if composite, matrix, and fiber deformations are all elastic, then 
𝜎c∕𝜀c=Ec, 𝜎m∕𝜀m=Em, and 𝜎f∕𝜀f=Ef, the Es being the moduli of elasticity for the 
respective phases. Substitution into Equation 16.9 yields an expression for the modulus

of elasticity of a continuous and aligned fibrous composite in the direction of alignment 
(or longitudinal direction), Ecl, as
 Ecl=EmVm+EfVf (16.10a)
or
 Ecl=Em(1−Vf)+EfVf (16.10b)
because the composite consists of only matrix and fiber phases; that is, Vm + Vf = 1.
 Thus, Ecl is equal to the volume-fraction weighted average of the moduli of elastic-
ity of the fiber and matrix phases. Other properties, including density, also have this 
dependence on volume fractions. Equation 16.10a is the fiber analogue of Equation 16.1, the upper bound for particle-reinforced composites. It can also be shown, for longitudinal loading, that the ratio of the load carried by the fibers to that carried by the matrix is

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 16.1
Property Determinations for a Glass Fiber–Reinforced 
Composite—Longitudinal Direction
A continuous and aligned glass fiber–reinforced composite consists of 40 vol% glass fibers 
having a modulus of elasticity of 69 GPa (10 × 106 psi) and 60 vol% polyester resin that, when 
hardened, displays a modulus of 3.4 GPa (0.5 × 106 psi).
(a) Compute the modulus of elasticity of this composite in the longitudinal direction.
(b) If the cross-sectional area is 250 mm2 (0.4 in.2) and a stress of 50 MPa (7250 psi) is applied in 
this longitudinal direction, compute the magnitude of the load carried by each of the fiber 
and matrix phases.
(c) Determine the strain that is sustained by each phase when the stress in part (b) is applied.
Solution
(a) The modulus of elasticity of the composite is calculated using Equation 16.10a:
 Ecl=(3.4 GPa)(0.6) +(69 GPa)(0.4)
 =30 GPa (4.3 ×106 psi)
(b) To solve this portion of the problem, first find the ratio of fiber load to matrix load, using 
Equation 16.11; thus,
Ff
Fm=(69 GPa)(0.4)
(3.4 GPa)(0.6)=13.5
 or Ff = 13.5 Fm.
In addition, the total force sustained by the composite Fc may be computed from the 
applied stress 𝜎 and total composite cross-sectional area Ac according to
Fc=Ac𝜎=(250 mm2)(50 MPa) =12,500 N (2900 lbf)
16.5 Influence of Fiber Orientation and Concentration   •  577
 However, this total load is just the sum of the loads carried by fiber and matrix phases; 
that is,
Fc=Ff+Fm=12,500 N (2900 lbf)
 Substitution for Ff from the preceding equation yields
13.5 Fm+Fm=12,500 N
 or
Fm=860 N (200 lbf)
 whereas
Ff=Fc−Fm=12,500 N −860 N =11,640 N (2700 lbf)
 Thus, the fiber phase supports the vast majority of the applied load.
(c) The stress for both fiber and matrix phases must first be calculated. Then, by using the 
elastic modulus for each [from part (a)], the strain values may be determined.
For stress calculations, phase cross-sectional areas are necessary:
Am=VmAc=(0.6)(250 mm2)=150 mm2 (0.24 in.2)
 and
Af=VfAc=(0.4)(250 mm2)=100 mm2 (0.16 in.2)
 Thus,
𝜎m =Fm
Am=860 N
150 mm2=5.73 MPa (833 psi)
𝜎f =Ff
Af=11,640 N
100 mm2=116.4 MPa (16,875 psi)
 Finally, strains are computed as
𝜀m =𝜎m
Em=5.73 MPa
3.4×103 MPa=1.69 ×10−3
 𝜀f =𝜎f
Ef=116.4 MPa
69×103 MPa=1.69 ×10−3
Therefore, strains for both matrix and fiber phases are identical, which they should be, 
 according to Equation 16.8 in the previous development.
Elastic Behavior—Transverse Loading
 A continuous and oriented fiber composite may be loaded in the transverse direction;  
that is, the load is applied at a 90 ° angle to the direction of fiber alignment as shown in 
Figure 16.8a . For this situation the stress 𝜎  to which the composite and both phases are 
exposed is the same, or
 𝜎c=𝜎m=𝜎f=𝜎 (16.12)
This is termed an isostress state. The strain or deformation of the entire composite

Solution
According to Equation 16.16,
 Ect=(3.4 GPa)(69 GPa)
(0.6)(69 GPa) +(0.4)(3.4 GPa)
 =5.5 GPa (0.81 ×106 psi)
 This value for Ect is slightly greater than that of the matrix phase but, from Example 
Problem 16.1a, only approximately one-fifth of the modulus of elasticity along the fiber direction 
(Ecl), which indicates the degree of anisotropy of continuous and oriented fiber composites.
Longitudinal Tensile Strength
 We now consider the strength characteristics of continuous and aligned fiber–reinforced composites that are loaded in the longitudinal direction. Under these circumstances, strength is normally taken as the maximum stress on the stress–strain curve, Figure 16.9b ; often this point corresponds to fiber fracture and marks the on-
set of composite failure. Table 16.1 lists typical longitudinal tensile strength values for three common fibrous composites. Failure of this type of composite material is a relatively complex process, and several different failure modes are possible. The mode that operates for a specific composite depends on fiber and matrix properties and the nature and strength of the fiber–matrix interfacial bond. If we assume that 𝜀
*f<𝜀*m (Figure 16.9a), which is the usual case, then fibers will 
fail before the matrix. Once the fibers have fractured, most of the load that was borne by the fibers will be transferred to the matrix. This being the case, it is possible to adapt 
16.5 Influence of Fiber Orientation and Concentration   •  579
the  expression for the stress on this type of composite, Equation 16.7, into the following 
expression for the longitudinal strength of the composite, 𝜎*cl:
 𝜎*cl=𝜎′m(1−Vf)+𝜎*f   Vf (16.17)
Here, 𝜎′m is the stress in the matrix at fiber failure (as illustrated in Figure 16.9 a) and, as 
previously, 𝜎*f is the fiber tensile strength.
Transverse Tensile Strength
 The strengths of continuous and unidirectional fibrous composites are highly anisotropic, and such composites are normally designed to be loaded along the high-strength, longitudinal direction. However, during in-service applications, transverse tensile loads may also be present. Under these circumstances, premature failure may result inasmuch as transverse strength is usually extremely low—it sometimes lies be-low the tensile strength of the matrix. Thus, the reinforcing effect of the fibers is nega-tive. Typical transverse tensile strengths for three unidirectional composites are listed in Table 16.1. Whereas longitudinal strength is dominated by fiber strength, a variety of factors will have a significant influence on the transverse strength; these factors include proper-ties of both the fiber and matrix, the fiber–matrix bond strength, and the presence of voids. Measures that have been used to improve the transverse strength of these com-posites usually involve modifying properties of the matrix.For a continuous

Discontinuous and Aligned-Fiber Composites
Even though reinforcement efficiency is lower for discontinuous than for continuous 
fibers, discontinuous and aligned-fiber composites (Figure 16.8 b) are becoming increas-
ingly important in the commercial market. Chopped-glass fibers are used most exten-sively; however, carbon and aramid discontinuous fibers are also used. These short-fiber composites can be produced with moduli of elasticity and tensile strengths that approach 90% and 50%, respectively, of their continuous-fiber counterparts. For a discontinuous and aligned-fiber composite having a uniform distribution of fibers and in which l>l
c, the longitudinal strength ( 𝜎*cd) is given by the relationship
 𝜎*cd=𝜎*fVf  (1−lc
2l)+𝜎′m (1−Vf) (16.18)
where 𝜎f* and 𝜎′m represent, respectively, the fracture strength of the fiber and the stress 
in the matrix when the composite fails (Figure 16.9 a).
 If the fiber length is less than critical ( l<lc), then the longitudinal strength ( 𝜎*cd′) 
is given by
 𝜎*cd′=l𝜏c
d Vf+𝜎′m(1−Vf) (16.19)
where d is the fiber diameter and 𝜏c is the smaller of either the fiber–matrix bond 
strength or the matrix shear yield strength.
Discontinuous and Randomly Oriented–Fiber Composites
Normally, when the fiber orientation is random, short and discontinuous fibers are 
used; reinforcement of this type is schematically demonstrated in Figure 16.8 c. Under 
these circumstances, a rule-of-mixtures expression for the elastic modulus similar to Equation 16.10a may be used, as follows:
 
Ecd=KEfVf+EmVm (16.20)
In this expression, K  is a fiber efficiency parameter that depends on Vf and the Ef /Em ratio. 
Its magnitude will be less than unity, usually in the range 0.1 to 0.6. Thus, for random-fiber reinforcement (as with oriented-fiber reinforcement), the modulus increases with increasing volume fraction of fiber. Table 16.2, which gives some of the mechanical For a discontinuous

properties of unreinforced and reinforced polycarbonates for discontinuous and ran-
domly oriented glass fibers, provides an idea of the magnitude of the reinforcement that is possible.
 By way of summary, then, we say that aligned fibrous composites are inherently aniso-
tropic in that the maximum strength and reinforcement are achieved along the alignment (longitudinal) direction. In the transverse direction, fiber reinforcement is virtually nonex-istent: fracture usually occurs at relatively low tensile stresses. For other stress orientations, composite strength lies between these extremes. The efficiency of fiber reinforcement for several situations is presented in Table 16.3; this efficiency is taken to be unity for an oriented-fiber composite in the alignment direction and zero perpendicular to it. When multidirectional stresses are imposed within a single plane, aligned layers that are fastened together on top of one another at different orientations are frequently used. These are termed laminar composites, which are discussed in Section 16.14.
 Applications involving totally multidirectional applied stresses normally use dis-continuous fibers, which are randomly oriented in the matrix material. Table 16.3 shows that the reinforcement efficiency is only one-fifth that of an aligned composite in the longitudinal direction; however, the mechanical characteristics are isotropic. Consideration of orientation and fiber length for a particular composite depends on the level and nature of the applied stress as well as on the fabrication cost. Production rates for short-fiber composites (both aligned and randomly oriented) are rapid, and intricate shapes can be formed that are not possible with continuous fiber reinforcement. Furthermore, fabrication costs are considerably lower than for continuous and aligned fibers; fabrication techniques applied to short-fiber composite materials include compression, injection, and extrusion molding, which are described for unreinforced polymers in Section 15.23.

An important characteristic of most materials, especially brittle ones, is that a small-
diameter fiber is much stronger than the bulk material. As discussed in Section 12.8, the probability of the presence of a critical surface flaw that can lead to fracture decreases with decreasing specimen volume, and this feature is used to advantage in fiber-reinforced composites. Also, the materials used for reinforcing fibers have high tensile strengths.16.6 THE FIBER PHASE
582  •   Chapter 16  /  Composites
 On the basis of diameter and character, fibers are grouped into three different clas-
sifications: whiskers, fibers, and wires. Whiskers are very thin single crystals that have 
extremely large length-to-diameter ratios. As a consequence of their small size, they have a high degree of crystalline perfection and are virtually flaw-free, which accounts for their exceptionally high strengths; they are among the strongest known materials. In spite of these high strengths, whiskers are not used extensively as a reinforcement me-dium because they are extremely expensive. Moreover, it is difficult and often impracti-cal to incorporate whiskers into a matrix. Whisker materials include graphite, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, and aluminum oxide; some mechanical characteristics of these materials are given in Table 16.4.whisker

16.8 Polymer–Matrix Composites  •   583
 Materials that are classified as fibers are either polycrystalline or amorphous and 
have small diameters; fibrous materials are generally either polymers or ceramics (e.g., the polymer aramids, glass, carbon, boron, aluminum oxide, and silicon carbide). Table 16.4 
also presents some data on a few materials that are used in fiber form. Fine wires have relatively large diameters; typical materials include steel, molybde-num, and tungsten. Wires are used as a radial steel reinforcement in automobile tires, in filament-wound rocket casings, and in wire-wound high-pressure hoses.fiber
The matrix phase of fibrous composites may be a metal, polymer, or ceramic. In general, 
metals and polymers are used as matrix materials because some ductility is desirable; for ceramic-matrix composites (Section 16.10), the reinforcing component is added to improve fracture toughness. The discussion of this section focuses on polymer and metal matrices. For fiber-reinforced composites, the matrix phase serves several functions. First, it binds the fibers together and acts as the medium by which an externally applied stress is transmitted and distributed to the fibers; only a very small proportion of an applied load is sustained by the matrix phase. Furthermore, the matrix material should be ductile. In addition, the elastic modulus of the fiber should be much higher than that of the matrix. The second function of the matrix is to protect the individual fibers from surface dam-age as a result of mechanical abrasion or chemical reactions with the environment. Such interactions may introduce surface flaws capable of forming cracks, which may lead to failure at low tensile stress levels. Finally, the matrix separates the fibers and, by virtue of its relative softness and plasticity, prevents the propagation of brittle cracks from fiber to fiber, which could result in catastrophic failure; in other words, the matrix phase serves as a barrier to crack propagation. Even though some of the individual fibers fail, total composite fracture will not occur until large numbers of adjacent fibers fail and form a cluster of critical size. It is essential that adhesive bonding forces between fiber and matrix be high to minimize fiber pullout. Bonding strength is an important consideration in the choice of the fiber–matrix combination. The ultimate strength of the composite depends to a large degree on the magnitude of this bond; adequate bonding is essential to maximize the stress transmittance from the weak matrix to the strong fibers.16.7 THE MATRIX PHASE
Polymer–matrix composites ( PMCs) consist of a polymer resin2 as the matrix and fibers 
as the reinforcement medium. These materials are used in the greatest diversity of com-posite applications, as well as in the largest quantities, in light of their room-temperature properties, ease of fabrication, and cost. In this section the various classifications of PMCs are discussed according to reinforcement type (i.e., glass, carbon, and aramid), along with their applications and the various polymer resins that are employed.

Fiberglass is simply a composite consisting of glass fibers, either continuous or discontinu-ous, contained within a polymer matrix; this type of composite is produced in the largest quantities. The composition of the glass that is most commonly drawn into fibers (sometimes polymer–matrix

referred to as E-glass) is given in Table 13.1; fiber diameters normally range between 3 and 
20 μm. Glass is popular as a fiber reinforcement material for several reasons:
 1. It is easily drawn into high-strength fibers from the molten state.
 2. It is readily available and may be fabricated into a glass-reinforced plastic 
economically using a wide variety of composite-manufacturing techniques.
 3. As a fiber it is relatively strong, and when embedded in a plastic matrix, it 
produces a composite having a very high specific strength.
 4. When coupled with the various plastics, it possesses a chemical inertness that 
renders the composite useful in a variety of corrosive environments.
 The surface characteristics of glass fibers are extremely important because even 
minute surface flaws can deleteriously affect the tensile properties, as discussed in Section 12.8. Surface flaws are easily introduced by rubbing or abrading the surface with another hard material. Also, glass surfaces that have been exposed to the normal atmosphere for even short time periods generally have a weakened surface layer that interferes with bonding to the matrix. Newly drawn fibers are normally coated during drawing with a size, a thin layer of a substance that protects the fiber surface from dam-age and undesirable environmental interactions. This size is ordinarily removed before composite fabrication and replaced with a coupling agent or finish that produces a 
chemical bond between the fiber and matrix. There are several limitations to this group of materials. In spite of having high strengths, they are not very stiff and do not display the rigidity that is necessary for some applications (e.g., as structural members for airplanes and bridges). Most fiberglass ma-terials are limited to service temperatures below 200°C (400°F); at higher temperatures, most polymers begin to flow or to deteriorate. Service temperatures may be extended to approximately 300°C (575°F) by using high-purity fused silica for the fibers and high-temperature polymers such as the polyimide resins. Many fiberglass applications are familiar: automotive and marine bodies, plastic pipes, storage containers, and industrial floorings. The transportation industries are us-ing increasing amounts of glass fiber–reinforced plastics in an effort to decrease vehicle weight and boost fuel efficiencies. A host of new applications is being used or currently investigated by the automotive industry.
Carbon Fiber–Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Composites
Carbon is a high-performance fiber material that is the most commonly used reinforce-ment in advanced (i.e., nonfiberglass) polymer-matrix composites. The reasons for this are as follows:
 1. Carbon fibers have high specific moduli and specific strengths.
 2. They retain their high tensile modulus and high strength at elevated 
temperatures; high-temperature oxidation, however, may be a problem.
 3. At room temperature, carbon fibers are not affected by moisture or a wide 
variety of solvents, acids, and bases.
 4. These fibers exhibit a diversity of physical and mechanical characteristics, 
allowing composites incorporating these fibers to have specific engineered properties.
 5. Fiber- and composite-manufacturing processes have been developed that are rela-
tively inexpensive and cost effective.
 A schematic representation of a typical carbon fiber is shown in Figure 13.7, where 
it may be noted that the fiber is composed of both graphitic (ordered) and turbostratic (disordered) structures.
16.8 Polymer–Matrix Composites  •   585
 Manufacturing techniques for producing carbon fibers are relatively complex and 
are not discussed. However, three different organic precursor materials are used: rayon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and pitch. Processing techniques vary from precursor to pre-cursor, as do the resultant fiber characteristics. One classification scheme for carbon fibers is by tensile modulus; on this basis, the four classes are standard, intermediate, high, and ultra-high moduli. Fiber diameters normally range between 4 and 10 μm; both continuous and chopped forms are available. 
In addition, carbon fibers are normally coated with a protective epoxy size that also improves adhesion with the polymer matrix. Carbon-reinforced polymer composites are currently being used extensively in sports and recreational equipment (fishing rods, golf clubs), filament-wound rocket motor cases, pressure vessels, and aircraft structural components—both military and commercial, both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters (e.g., as wing, body, stabilizer, and rudder components).
Aramid Fiber–Reinforced Polymer Composites
Aramid fibers are high-strength, high-modulus materials that were introduced in the early 1970s. They are especially desirable for their outstanding strength-to-weight ratios, which are superior to those of metals. Chemically, this group of materials is known as poly(paraphenylene terephthalamide). There are a number of aramid materials; trade names for two of the most common are Kevlar and Nomex. For the former, there are several grades (Kevlar 29, 49, and 149) that have different mechanical behaviors. During synthesis, the rigid molecules are aligned in the direction of the fiber axis, as liquid crys-tal domains (Section 15.20); the repeat unit and the mode of chain alignment are repre-sented in Figure 16.10. Mechanically, these fibers have longitudinal tensile strengths and tensile moduli (Table 16.4) that are higher than those of other polymeric fiber materials; however, they are relatively weak in compression. In addition, this material is known for its toughness, impact resistance, and resistance to creep and fatigue failure. Even though the aramids are thermoplastics, they are, nevertheless, resistant to combustion and stable to relatively high temperatures; the temperature range over which they retain their high mechanical properties is between −200°C and 200°C (−330°F and 390°F). 
Chemically, they are susceptible to degradation by strong acids and bases, but they are relatively inert in other solvents and chemicals. The aramid fibers are most often used in composites having polymer matrices; com-mon matrix materials are the epoxies and polyesters. Because the fibers are relatively flexible and somewhat ductile, they may be processed by most common textile operations. Typical applications of these aramid composites are in ballistic products (bulletproof

replacement for asbestos in automotive brake and clutch linings and gaskets.
 The properties of continuous and aligned glass, carbon, and aramid fiber–reinforced 
epoxy composites are given in Table 16.5. A comparison of the mechanical characteristics of these three materials may be made in both longitudinal and transverse directions.
Other Fiber-Reinforcement Materials
Glass, carbon, and the aramids are the most common fiber reinforcements incorporated into polymer matrices. Other fiber materials that are used to much lesser degrees are boron, silicon carbide, and aluminum oxide; tensile moduli, tensile strengths, specific strengths, and specific moduli of these materials in fiber form are given in Table 16.4. Boron fiber–reinforced polymer composites have been used in military aircraft compo-nents, helicopter rotor blades, and sporting goods. Silicon carbide and aluminum oxide fibers are used in tennis rackets, circuit boards, military armor, and rocket nose cones.
Polymer-Matrix Materials
The roles assumed by the polymer matrix are outlined in Section 16.7. In addition, the matrix often determines the maximum service temperature because it normally softens, melts, or degrades at a much lower temperature than the fiber reinforcement. The most widely used and least expensive polymer resins are the polyesters and vinyl esters.
3 These matrix materials are used primarily for glass fiber–reinforced com-
posites. A large number of resin formulations provide a wide range of properties for these polymers. The epoxies are more expensive and, in addition to commercial appli-cations, are also used extensively in PMCs for aerospace applications; they have better mechanical properties and resistance to moisture than the polyesters and vinyl resins. For high-temperature applications, polyimide resins are employed; their continuous-use, upper-temperature limit is approximately 230°C (450°F). Finally, high-temperature thermoplastic resins offer the potential to be used in future aerospace applications; such materials include polyetheretherketone (PEEK), poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), and polyetherimide (PEI).

DESIGN EXAMPLE 16.1
Design of a Tubular Composite Shaft
A tubular composite shaft is to be designed that has an outside diameter of 70 mm (2.75 in.), 
an inside diameter of 50 mm (1.97 in.), and a length of 1.0 m (39.4 in.); such is represented schematically in Figure 16.11. The mechanical characteristic of prime importance is bending stiffness in terms of the longitudinal modulus of elasticity; strength and fatigue resistance are not significant parameters for this application when filament composites are used. Stiffness is to be specified as maximum allowable deflection in bending; when subjected to three-point bending as in Figure 12.30 (i.e., support points at both tube extremities and load application at the longitudinal midpoint), a load of 1000 N (225 lb
f) is to produce an elastic deflection of no 
more than 0.35 mm (0.014 in.) at the midpoint position. Continuous fibers that are oriented parallel to the tube axis will be used; possible fiber ma-terials are glass, and carbon in standard-, intermediate-, and high-modulus grades. The matrix material is to be an epoxy resin, and the maximum allowable fiber volume fraction is 0.60. This design problem calls for us to do the following:
(a) Decide which of the four fiber materials, when embedded in the epoxy matrix, meet the stipulated criteria.
(b) Of these possibilities, select the one fiber material that will yield the lowest-cost composite material (assuming fabrication costs are the same for all fibers).
 Elastic modulus, density, and cost data for the fiber and matrix materials are given in Table 16.6.

Solution
(a) It is first necessary to determine the required longitudinal modulus of elasticity for this 
composite material consistent with the stipulated criteria. This computation requires the use of the three-point deflection expression
 Δy=FL

48 EI (16.21)
 in which Δy is the midpoint deflection, F is the applied force, L is the support point separa-
tion distance, E is the modulus of elasticity, and I is the cross-sectional moment of inertia. For a tube having inside and outside diameters of d

 and

 For this shaft design,
  F=1000 N
 L=1.0 m
 Δy=0.35 mm

 di=50 mm
 Thus, the required longitudinal modulus of elasticity for this shaft is
 E=4(1000 N)(1.0  m)3
3𝜋(0.35 ×10−3 m)[(70 ×10−3 m)4−(50×10−3 m)4]
 =69.3 GPa (9.9 ×106 psi)
The next step is to determine the fiber and matrix volume fractions for each of the 
four candidate fiber materials. This is possible using the rule-of-mixtures expression, 
Equation 16.10b:
Ecs=EmVm+EfVf=Em(1−Vf)+EfVf
 Table 16.7 lists the Vm and Vf values required for Ecs=69.3 GPa; Equation 16.10b and the moduli 
data in Table 16.6 were used in these computations. Only the three carbon-fiber types are possible candidates because their V
f values are less than 0.60.
(b) At this point it becomes necessary to determine the volume of fibers and matrix for each 
of the three carbon types. The total tube volume Vc in centimeters is
  Vc=𝜋L
4  (do2−di2)  (16.24)
  =𝜋(100 cm)
4 [(7.0 cm)2−(5.0 cm)2] 
  =1885 cm3 (114 in.3) 
 Thus, fiber and matrix volumes result from products of this value and the Vf and Vm values 
cited in Table 16.7. These volume values are presented in Table 16.8, which are then converted 
16.9 Metal-Matrix Composites  •   589
into masses using densities (Table 16.6), and finally into material costs, from the per unit mass 
cost (also given in Table 16.6).
As may be noted in Table 16.8, the material of choice (i.e., the least expensive) is the 
standard-modulus carbon-fiber composite; the relatively low cost per unit mass of this fiber material offsets its relatively low modulus of elasticity and required high volume fraction.Table 16.7   Fiber and Matrix Volume Fractions for Glass

As the name implies, for metal-matrix composites (MMCs) the matrix is a ductile metal. 
These materials may be used at higher service temperatures than their base-metal counterparts; furthermore, the reinforcement may improve specific stiffness, specific strength, abrasion resistance, creep resistance, thermal conductivity, and dimensional stability. Some of the advantages of these materials over the polymer-matrix composites include higher operating temperatures, nonflammability, and greater resistance to degradation by organic fluids. Metal-matrix composites are much more expensive than PMCs, and, therefore, MMC use is somewhat restricted. The superalloys, as well as alloys of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and copper, are used as matrix materials. The reinforcement may be in the form of particulates, both continuous and discontinuous fibers, or whiskers; concentrations normally range between 10 and 60 vol%. Continuous-fiber materials include carbon, silicon carbide, boron, aluminum oxide, and the refractory metals. However, discontinuous reinforce-ments consist primarily of silicon carbide whiskers, chopped fibers of aluminum oxide and carbon, or particulates of silicon carbide and aluminum oxide. In a sense, the cer-mets (Section 16.2) fall within this MMC scheme. Table 16.9 presents the properties of several common metal-matrix, continuous and aligned fiber–reinforced composites.metal-matrix

590  •   Chapter 16  /  Composites
 Some matrix–reinforcement combinations are highly reactive at elevated tem-
peratures. Consequently, composite degradation may be caused by high-temperature processing or by subjecting the MMC to elevated temperatures during service. This problem is commonly resolved either by applying a protective surface coating to the reinforcement or by modifying the matrix alloy composition. Normally the processing of MMCs involves at least two steps: consolidation or synthesis (i.e., introduction of reinforcement into the matrix), followed by a shaping operation. A host of consolidation techniques are available, some of which are relatively sophisticated; discontinuous-fiber MMCs are amenable to shaping by standard metal-forming operations (e.g., forging, extrusion, rolling). Automobile manufacturers have recently begun to use MMCs in their products. For example, some engine components have been introduced consisting of an aluminum-alloy matrix that is reinforced with aluminum oxide and carbon fibers; this MMC is light in weight and resists wear and thermal distortion. Metal-matrix composites are also em-ployed in driveshafts (that have higher rotational speeds and reduced vibrational noise levels), extruded stabilizer bars, and forged suspension and transmission components. The aerospace industry also employs MMCs in the form of advanced aluminum-alloy metal-matrix composites. These materials have low densities, and it is possible to control their properties (i.e., mechanical and thermal properties). Continuous graphite fibers are used as the reinforcement for an antenna boom on the Hubble Space Telescope; this boom stabilizes the antenna position during space maneuvers. In ad-dition, Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites use silicon carbide–aluminum and graphite–aluminum MMCs for electronic packaging and thermal management systems. These MMCs have high thermal conductivities, and it is possible to match their coef-ficients of expansion with those of other electronic materials in the GPS components. The high-temperature creep and rupture properties of some superalloys (Ni- and Co-based alloys) may be enhanced by fiber reinforcement using refractory metals such as tungsten. Excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance and impact strength are also maintained. Designs incorporating these composites permit higher operating tem-peratures and better efficiencies for turbine engines.Table 16.9  Properties of Several Metal-Matrix Composites Reinforced with Continuous and Aligned Fibers

As discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, ceramic materials are inherently resilient to oxidation and deterioration at elevated temperatures; were it not for their disposition to brittle fracture, some of these materials would be ideal candidates for use in high-temperature and severe stress applications, specifically for components in automobile and aircraft gas turbine engines. Fracture toughness values for ceramic materials are 16.10 CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES
16.10 Ceramic-Matrix Composites  •   591
low and typically lie between 1 and 5 MPa √m (0.9 and 4.5 ksi √in.); see Table 8.1 and 
Table B.5 in Appendix B. By way of contrast, KIc values for most metals are much higher 
[15 to greater than 150 MPa √m (14 to >140 ksi √in.)].
 The fracture toughnesses of ceramics have been improved significantly by the 
development of a new generation of ceramic-matrix composites ( CMCs)—particulates, 
fibers, or whiskers of one ceramic material that have been embedded into a matrix of another ceramic. Ceramic-matrix composite materials have extended fracture tough-nesses to between about 6 and 20 MPa
√m (5.5 and 18 ksi √in.).
 In essence, this improvement in the fracture properties results from interactions between advancing cracks and dispersed phase particles. Crack initiation normally occurs with the matrix phase, whereas crack propagation is impeded or hindered by the particles, fibers, or whiskers. Several techniques are used to retard crack propagation, which are discussed as follows. One particularly interesting toughening technique uses a phase transformation to arrest the propagation of cracks and is aptly termed transformation toughening. Small 
particles of partially stabilized zirconia (Section 12.7) are dispersed within the matrix material, often Al
2O3 or ZrO2 itself. Typically, CaO, MgO, Y2O3, and CeO are used 
as stabilizers. Partial stabilization allows retention of the metastable tetragonal phase at ambient conditions rather than the stable monoclinic phase; these two phases are noted on the ZrO
2–CaZrO3 phase diagram in Figure 12.24. The stress field in front of 
a propagating crack causes these metastably retained tetragonal particles to undergo transformation to the stable monoclinic phase. Accompanying this transformation is a slight particle volume increase, and the net result is that compressive stresses are estab-lished on the crack surfaces near the crack tip that tend to pinch the crack shut, thereby arresting its growth. This process is demonstrated schematically in Figure 16.12. Other recently developed toughening techniques involve the use of ceramic whisk-ers, often SiC or Si
3N4. These whiskers may inhibit crack propagation by (1) deflecting 
crack tips, (2) forming bridges across crack faces, (3) absorbing energy during pullout as the whiskers debond from the matrix, and/or (4) causing a redistribution of stresses in regions adjacent to the crack tips. In general, increasing fiber content improves strength and fracture toughness; this is demonstrated in Table 16.10 for SiC whisker-reinforced alumina. Furthermore, there is a considerable reduction in the scatter of fracture strengths for whisker-reinforced ceramics relative to their unreinforced counterparts. In addition, these CMCs exhibit ceramic-matrix

improved high-temperature creep behavior and resistance to thermal shock (i.e., failure 
resulting from sudden changes in temperature). Ceramic-matrix composites may be fabricated using hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing, and liquid-phase sintering techniques. Relative to applications, SiC whisker-reinforced aluminas are being used as cutting-tool inserts for machining hard metal alloys; tool lives for these materials are greater than for cemented carbides (Section 16.2).

One of the most advanced and promising of engineering materials is the carbon fiber–
reinforced carbon-matrix composite, often termed a carbon–carbon composite; as the 
name implies, both reinforcement and matrix are carbon. These materials are relatively new and expensive and, therefore, are not currently being used extensively. Their de-sirable properties include high-tensile moduli and tensile strengths that are retained to temperatures in excess of 2000°C (3630°F), resistance to creep, and relatively large frac-ture toughness values. Furthermore, carbon–carbon composites have low coefficients of thermal expansion and relatively high thermal conductivities; these characteristics, coupled with high strengths, give rise to a relatively low susceptibility to thermal shock. Their major drawback is a propensity to high-temperature oxidation. The carbon–carbon composites are employed in rocket motors, as friction materials in aircraft and high-performance automobiles, for hot-pressing molds, in components for advanced turbine engines, and as ablative shields for re-entry vehicles. The primary reason that these composite materials are so expensive is the require-ment for relatively complex processing techniques. Preliminary procedures are similar to those used for carbon-fiber, polymer-matrix composites—that is, the continuous car-bon fibers are laid down having the desired two- or three-dimensional pattern; these fi-bers are then impregnated with a liquid polymer resin, often a phenolic; the workpiece is next formed into the final shape, and the resin is allowed to cure. At this time the matrix resin is pyrolyzed— that is, converted into carbon by heating in an inert atmosphere; dur-
ing pyrolysis, molecular components consisting of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are driven off, leaving behind large carbon-chain molecules. Subsequent heat treatments at higher temperatures cause this carbon matrix to densify and increase in strength. The resulting composite consists of the original carbon fibers, which remained essentially unaltered, contained in this pyrolyzed carbon matrix.carbon–carbon 
 composite16.11 CARBON–CARBON COMPOSITES
A relatively new fiber-reinforced composite is the hybrid, which is obtained by using 
two or more different kinds of fibers in a single matrix; hybrids have a better all-around combination of properties than composites containing only a single fiber type. A variety hybrid composite16.12 HYBRID COMPOSITES
16.13 Processing of Fiber-Reinforced Composites  •   593
of fiber combinations and matrix materials are used, but in the most common system, 
both carbon and glass fibers are incorporated into a polymeric resin. The carbon fibers are strong and relatively stiff and provide a low-density reinforcement; however, they are expensive. Glass fibers are inexpensive and lack the stiffness of carbon. The glass–carbon hybrid is stronger and tougher, has a higher impact resistance, and may be produced at a lower cost than either of the comparable all-carbon or all-glass reinforced plastics. The two different fibers may be combined in a number of ways, which will ulti-mately affect the overall properties. For example, the fibers may all be aligned and inti-mately mixed with one another, or laminations may be constructed consisting of layers, each of which consists of a single fiber type, alternating with one another. In virtually all hybrids, the properties are anisotropic. When hybrid composites are stressed in tension, failure is usually noncatastrophic  
(i.e., does not occur suddenly). The carbon fibers are the first to fail, at which time the load is transferred to the glass fibers. Upon failure of the glass fibers, the matrix phase must sustain the applied load. Eventual composite failure concurs with that of the matrix phase. Principal applications for hybrid composites are lightweight land, water, and air trans-port structural components, sporting goods, and lightweight orthopedic components.
To fabricate continuous fiber–reinforced plastics that meet design specifications, the fi-bers should be uniformly distributed within the plastic matrix and, in most instances, all oriented in virtually the same direction. This section discusses several techniques (pul-trusion, filament winding, and prepreg production processes) by which useful products of these materials are manufactured.
Pultrusion
Pultrusion is used for the manufacture of components having continuous lengths and a constant cross-sectional shape (rods, tubes, beams, etc.). With this technique, illustrated schematically in Figure 16.13, continuous-fiber rovings, or tows,
4 are first impregnated 
with a thermosetting resin; these are then pulled through a steel die that preforms to the desired shape and also establishes the resin/fiber ratio. The stock then passes through a curing die that is precision machined so as to impart the final shape; this die is also heated to initiate curing of the resin matrix. A pulling device draws the stock through the dies and also determines the production speed. Tubes and hollow sections are made possible by using center mandrels or inserted hollow cores. Principal reinforcements are glass, 16.13 PROCESSING OF FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITES

carbon, and aramid fibers, normally added in concentrations between 40 and 70 vol%. 
Commonly used matrix materials include polyesters, vinyl esters, and epoxy resins. Pultrusion is a continuous process that is easily automated; production rates are rela-tively high, making it very cost effective. Furthermore, a wide variety of shapes are pos-sible, and there is really no practical limit to the length of stock that may be manufactured.
Prepreg Production Processes
Prepreg is the composite industry’s term for continuous-fiber reinforcement preimpreg-nated with a polymer resin that is only partially cured. This material is delivered in tape form to the manufacturer, which then directly molds and fully cures the product without having to add any resin. It is probably the composite material form most widely used for structural applications. The prepregging process, represented schematically for thermoset polymers in Figure 16.14, begins by collimating a series of spool-wound continuous-fiber tows. These tows are then sandwiched and pressed between sheets of release and carrier paper using heated rollers, a process termed calendering. The release paper sheet has been coated with a thin film of heated resin solution of relatively low viscosity so as to provide for its thorough impregnation of the fibers. A doctor blade spreads the resin into a film of 
uniform thickness and width. The final prepreg product—the thin tape consisting of con-tinuous and aligned fibers embedded in a partially cured resin—is prepared for packag-ing by winding onto a cardboard core. As shown in Figure 16.14, the release paper sheet is removed as the impregnated tape is spooled. Typical tape thicknesses range between 0.08 and 0.25 mm (3 ×  10
−3 and 10−2 in.) and tape widths range between 25 and 
1525 mm (1 and 60 in.); resin content usually lies between about 35 and 45 vol%.
 At room temperature, the thermoset matrix undergoes curing reactions; therefore, the prepreg is stored at 0 °C (32°F) or lower. Also, the time in use at room temperature 
(or out-time) must be minimized. If properly handled, thermoset prepregs have a life-
time of at least six months and usually longer. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting resins are used; carbon, glass, and aramid fibers are the common reinforcements. Actual fabrication begins with the lay-up —laying of the prepreg tape onto a tooled 
surface. Normally a number of plies are laid up (after removal from the carrier backing paper) to provide the desired thickness. The lay-up arrangement may be unidirectional, but more often the fiber orientation is alternated to produce a cross-ply or angle-ply laminate (Section 16.14). Final curing is accomplished by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure. The lay-up procedure may be carried out entirely by hand (hand lay-up), in which the operator both cuts the lengths of tape and then positions them in the desired orienta-tion on the tooled surface. Alternatively, tape patterns may be machine cut, then hand laid. Fabrication costs can be further reduced by automation of prepreg lay-up and other manufacturing procedures (e.g., filament winding, as discussed next), which virtually eliminates the need for hand labor. These automated methods are essential for many applications of composite materials to be cost effective.
Filament Winding
Filament winding is a process by which continuous reinforcing fibers are accurately posi-tioned in a predetermined pattern to form a hollow (usually cylindrical) shape. The fibers, either as individual strands or as tows, are first fed through a resin bath and then are contin-uously wound onto a mandrel, usually using automated winding equipment (Figure 16.15). After the appropriate number of layers have been applied, curing is carried out either in an oven or at room temperature, after which the mandrel is removed. As an alternative, narrow and thin prepregs (i.e., tow pregs) 10 mm or less in width may be filament wound.prepreg

 Various winding patterns are possible (i.e., circumferential, helical, and polar) 
to give the desired mechanical characteristics. Filament-wound parts have very high strength-to-weight ratios. Also, a high degree of control over winding uniformity and orientation is afforded with this technique. Furthermore, when automated, the process is most economically attractive. Common filament-wound structures include rocket mo-tor casings, storage tanks and pipes, and pressure vessels. Manufacturing techniques are being used to produce a wide variety of structural shapes that are not necessarily limited to surfaces of revolution (e.g., I-beams). This technology is advancing very rapidly because it is very cost effective.Figure 16.14  Schematic diagram illustrating the production of

A structural composite is a multilayered and normally low-density composite used in 
applications requiring structural integrity, ordinarily high tensile, compressive, and 
torsional strengths and stiffnesses. The properties of these composites depend not only on the properties of the constituent materials, but also on the geometrical design of the structural elements. Laminar composites and sandwich panels are two of the most com-mon structural composites.structural compositeStructural Composites
A laminar composite is composed of two-dimensional sheets or panels (plies or laminae) 
bonded to one another. Each ply has a preferred high-strength direction, such as is found in continuous and aligned fiber–reinforced polymers. A multilayered  structure laminar composite16.14 LAMINAR COMPOSITES

such as this is termed a laminate. Laminate properties depend on several factors, including 
how the high-strength direction varies from layer to layer. In this regard, there are four 
classes of laminar composites: unidirectional, cross-ply, angle-ply, and multidirectional. 
For unidirectional, the orientation of the high-strength direction for all laminae is the same (Figure 16.16a); cross-ply laminates have alternating high-strength layer orienta-tions of 0° and 90° (Figure 16.16b); and for angle-ply, successive layers alternate between +𝜃 and −𝜃 high-strength orientations (e.g., ±45°) (Figure 16.16c). The multidirectional 
laminates have several high-strength orientations (Figure 16.16d). For virtually all lami-nates, layers are typically stacked such that fiber orientations are symmetric relative to the laminate midplane; this arrangement prevents any out-of-plane twisting or bending. In-plane properties (e.g., modulus of elasticity and strength) of unidirectional lami-nates are highly anisotropic. Cross-, angle-, and multidirectional laminates are designed to increase the degree of in-plane isotropy; multidirectional can be fabricated to be most highly isotropic; degree of isotropy decreases with angle- and cross-ply materials. Stress and strain relationships for laminates have been developed that are analogous to Equations 16.10 and 16.16 for continuous and aligned fiber–reinforced composites. However, these expressions use tensor algebra, which is beyond the scope of this discussion.0°

16.15 Sandwich Panels  •   597
 One of the most common laminate materials is unidirectional prepreg tape in an 
uncured matrix resin. A multilayered structure having the desired configuration is produced during lay-up as a number of tapes are laid one upon another at a variety of predetermined high-strength orientations. Overall strength and degree of isotropy depends on fiber material and number of layers, as well as orientation sequence. Most laminate fiber materials are carbon, glass, and aramid. Subsequent to lay-up, the resin must be cured and layers bonded together; this is accomplished by heating the part while pressure is being applied. Techniques used for post-lay-up processing include autoclave molding, pressure-bag molding, and vacuum-bag molding. Laminations may also be constructed using fabric material such as cotton, paper, or woven-glass fibers embedded in a plastic matrix. In-plane degree of isotropy is relatively high in this group of materials. Applications that use laminate composites are primarily in aircraft, automotive, ma-rine, and building/civil-infrastructure sectors. Specific applications include the follow-ing: aircraft—fuselage, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, landing-gear hatches, floors, fairings, and rotor blades for helicopters; automotive—automobile panels, sports car bodies, and drive shafts; marine—ship hulls, hatch covers, deckhouses, bulkheads, and propellers; building/civil-infrastructure—bridge components, long-span roof structures, beams, structural panels, roof panels, and tanks. Laminates are also used extensively in sports and recreation equipment. For ex-ample, the modern ski (see the chapter-opening illustration) is a relatively complex laminated structure.
Sandwich panels, a class of structural composites, are designed to be lightweight beams or panels having relatively high stiffnesses and strengths. A sandwich panel consists of two outer sheets, faces, or skins that are separated by and adhesively bonded to a thicker core (Figure 16.17). The outer sheets are made of a relatively stiff and strong material, typically aluminum alloys, steel and stainless steel, fiber-reinforced plastics, and ply-wood; they carry bending loads that are applied to the panel. When a sandwich panel is bent, one face experiences compressive stresses, the other tensile stresses. The core material is lightweight and normally has a low modulus of elasticity. Structurally, it serves several functions. First, it provides continuous support for the faces and holds them together. In addition, it must have sufficient shear strength to withstand transverse shear stresses and also be thick enough to provide high shear stiff-ness (to resist buckling of the panel). Tensile and compressive stresses on the core are much lower than on the faces. Panel stiffness depends primarily on the properties of the core material and core thickness; bending stiffness increases significantly with increasing core thickness. Furthermore, it is essential that faces be bonded strongly to the core. The

sandwich panel is a cost-effective composite because core materials are less expensive 
than materials used for the faces. Core materials typically fall within three categories: rigid polymeric foams, wood, and honeycombs.
• Both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers are used as rigid foam materials; 
these include (and are ranked from least to most expensive) polystyrene, phenol-formaldehyde (phenolic), polyurethane, poly(vinyl chloride), polypropylene, polyetherimide, and polymethacrylimide.
• Balsa wood is also commonly used as a core material for several reasons: (1) Its 
density is extremely low (0.10 to 0.25 g/cm
3), which, however, is higher than some 
other core materials; (2) it is relatively inexpensive; and (3) it has relatively high compression and shear strengths.
• Another popular core consists of a “honeycomb” structure—thin foils that have been 
formed into interlocking cells (having hexagonal as well as other confi  gurations), with 
axes oriented perpendicular to the face planes; Figure 16.18 shows a cutaway view of a hexagonal honeycomb core sandwich panel. Mechanical properties of honeycombs are anisotropic: Tensile and compressive strengths are greatest in a direction parallel to the cell axis; shear strength is highest in the plane of the panel. Strength and stiff-ness of honeycomb structures depend on cell size, cell wall thickness, and the ma terial from which the honeycomb is made. Honeycomb structures also have excellent sound and vibration damping characteristics because of the high volume fraction of void space within each cell. Honeycombs are fabricated from thin sheets. Materials used for these core structures include metal alloys—aluminum-, titanium-, nickel-based, and stainless steels; and polymers—polypropylene, polyurethane, kraft paper (a tough brown paper used for heavy-duty shopping bags and cardboard), and aramid fi  bers.
 Sandwich panels are used in a wide variety of aircraft, construction, automotive, and marine applications, including the following: aircraft—leading and trailing edges, radomes, fairings, nacelles (cowlings and fan-duct sections around turbine engines), flaps, rudders, stabilizers, and rotor blades for helicopters; construction—architectural cladding for buildings, decorative facades and interior surfaces, insulated roof and wall systems, clean-room panels, and built-in cabinetry; automotive—headliners, luggage compartment floors, spare wheel covers, and cabin floors; marine—bulkheads, furniture, and wall, ceiling, and partition panels.

Use of Composites in the Boeing 787 DreamlinerCASE STUDY 16.1
A revolution in the use of composite materials for 
commercial aircraft has recently commenced with 
the advent of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (Figure 16.19). This aircraft—a long-range, mid-size (210 to 290 passen-ger capacity), twin-engine jet airliner—is the first to use composite materials for the majority of its construction. Thus, it is lighter in weight than its predecessors, which leads to greater fuel efficiency (a reduction of approxi-mately 20%), fewer emissions, and longer flying ranges. Furthermore, this composite construction makes for a more comfortable flying experience—cabin pressure and humidity levels are higher than for its ancestors and noise levels have been reduced. In addition, overhead bins are roomier and windows are larger. Composite materials account for 50% (by weight) of the Dreamliner and aluminum alloys 20%. By way of contrast, the Boeing 777 consists of 11% composites and 70% aluminum alloys. These com-posite and aluminum contents as well as contents for other materials used in the construction of both 777 and 787 aircraft (i.e., titanium alloys, steel, and other) are listed in Table 16.11. By far the most common composite structures are continuous carbon fiber–epoxy laminates, the majority of which are used in the fuselage (Figure 16.20). These

laminates are composed of prepreg tapes that are laid 
one upon another in predetermined orientations using a continuous tape–laying machine. A single-piece sec-tion of fuselage (or barrel) is fashioned in this manner, which is subsequently cured under pressure in a huge autoclave. Six such barrel units are attached to one another to form the complete fuselage. For previous commercial aircraft, the primary components of the fuselage structure were aluminum sheets fastened together using rivets. Advantages of this composite barrel structure over previous designs using aluminum alloys include the following:
• Reductions in assembly costs—approximately 
1500 aluminum sheets that are fastened  together with approximately 50,000 rivets are eliminated.
• Cost reductions for scheduled maintenance and 
inspections for corrosion and fatigue cracks.
• Reductions in aerodynamic drag—rivets protrud-
ing from surfaces increase wind resistance and decrease fuel effi  ciency. The fuselage of the Dreamliner was the first at-tempt to mass produce extremely large composite structures composed of carbon fibers embedded in a thermosetting polymer (i.e., an epoxy). Thus, it became necessary for Boeing (and its subcontractors) to develop and implement new and innovative manu-facturing technologies. As Figure 16.20 notes, carbon laminates are also used in wing and tail structures. The other com-posites indicated in this same illustration are glass fiber– reinforced epoxy and hybrid composites, which 
are composed of both glass and carbon fibers. These other composites are used primarily in tail and trail-ing wing structures. Sandwich panels are used in nacelles (i.e., housing structures that surround the engines) as well as trailing tail components (Figure 16.20). Faces for most of these panels are carbon fiber–epoxy laminates, whereas cores are honeycomb structures typically made from aluminum alloy sheet. Noise reduction of some nacelle components is increased by embedding a nonmetallic (or “cap” material) within the honeycomb cells.
The materials world is experiencing a revolution with the development of a new class of composite materials—the nanocomposites. Nanocomposites are composed of nano-
sized particles (or nanoparticles)
5 that are embedded in a matrix material. They can 
be designed to have mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, thermal, biological, and 
transport properties that are superior to conventional filler materials; these properties can be tailored for use in specific applications. For these reasons, nanocomposites are becoming infused in a number of modern technologies.

 An interesting and novel phenomenon accompanies the decrease in size of a nanoparticle—its physical and chemical properties experience dramatic changes; fur-thermore, the degree of change depends on particle size (i.e., number of atoms). For example, the permanent magnetic behavior of some materials [e.g., iron, cobalt, and iron oxide (Fe
3O4)] disappears for particles having diameters smaller than about 50 nm.7
 Two factors account for these size-induced properties of nanoparticles: (1) the increase in ratio of particle surface area to volume; and (2) particle size. As Section 4.6 notes, surface atoms behave differently than atoms located in the interior of a material. Consequently, as the size of a particle decreases, the relative ratio of surface atoms to bulk atoms increases; this means that surface phenomena begin to dominate. For extremely small particles, quantum effects begin to appear.nanocomposite16.16 NANOCOMPOSITES
5To qualify as a nanoparticle, the largest particle dimension must on the order of at most 100 nm.
6Carbon-black reinforced rubber (Section 16.2) is an example of a nanocomposite; particle sizes typically range 
 between 20 and 50 nm. Strength and toughness as well as tear and abrasion resistance are enhanced because of the 
presence of carbon-black particles.
7This phenomenon is termed superparamagnetism; superparamagnetic particles embedded in a matrix are used for 
magnetic storage, which is discussed in Section 20.11.
16.16 Nanocomposites  •   601
 Although nanocomposite matrix materials may be metals and ceramics, the most 
common matrices are polymers. For these polymer nanocomposites, a large number of 
thermoplastic, thermosetting, and elastomeric matrices are used, including epoxy resins, polyurethanes, polypropylene, polycarbonate, poly(ethylene terephthalate), silicone resins, poly(methyl methacrylate), polyamides (nylons), poly(vinylidene chloride), ethylene vinyl alcohol, butyl rubber, and natural rubber. The properties of a nanocomposite depend not only on the properties of both matrix and nanoparticle, but also on nanoparticle shape and content as well as matrix–nanoparticle interfacial characteristics. Most of today’s commercial nanocomposites use three general nanoparticle types: nanocarbons, nanoclays, and particulate nanocrystals.
• Included in the nanocarbon group are single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes, 
graphene sheets (Section 13.10), and carbon nanofi  bers.
• The nanoclays are layered silicates (Section 12.3); the most common type is mont-
morillonite clay.
• Most particulate nanocrystals are inorganic oxides such as silica, alumina, zirconia, 
halfnia, and titania.
Nanoparticle loadings (i.e., contents) vary significantly and depend on application. For example, carbon nanotube concentrations on the order of 5 wt% can lead to significant increases in strength and stiffness. However, between 15 and 20 wt% of carbon nano-tubes are required to produce electrical conductivities necessary for some applications (e.g., to protect a nanocomposite structure from experiencing electrostatic discharges). One of the main challenges in the production of nanocomposite materials is process-ing. For most applications, the nanosize particles must be dispersed uniformly and homoge-neously within the matrix. Novel dispersion and fabrication techniques have been and are continually being developed for producing nanocomposites with the desired properties. These nanocomposite materials have carved out niches in a host of different tech-nologies and industries, including the following:
• Gas-barrier coatings —The freshness and shelf lives of foods and beverages may 
be increased when they are packaged in nanocomposite thin fi  lm bags/containers. 
Normally, these fi  lms are composed of montmorillonite nanoclay particles that have been exfoliated (i.e., separated from one another) and during incorporation into the polymer matrix are aligned such that their lateral axes are parallel to the plane of the coating. Furthermore, the coatings may be transparent. The presence of nanoclay particles accounts for the ability of the fi  lm to effectively contain H
2O molecules in packaged foods (to preserve freshness) and CO2 molecules in 
carbonated beverages (to retain “fi  zz”), and also keep O2 molecules from the air 
outside (to protect packaged foods from oxidation). These platelet particles act as multilayer barriers to the diffusion of gas molecules—that is, they slow down the diffusion rate because the gas molecules must bypass the particles as they diffuse through the coating. Another asset of these coatings is their recyclability.
Nanocomposite coatings are also used to increase air pressure retention for 
automobile tires and sports (e.g., tennis, soccer) balls. These coatings are com-posed of small and exfoliated vermiculite
8 platelets that are embedded in the tire/
sports ball rubber. Furthermore, platelet particles are aligned in the same manner as for food/beverage coatings described previously such that diffusion of pres-surized air molecules through the rubber walls is suppressed.
• Energy storage —Graphene nanocomposites are used in anodes for lithium-ion 
rechargeable batteries—batteries that store electrical energy in hybrid electric 
8Vermiculite is another member of the layered silicates group discussed in Section 12.3.
602  •   Chapter 16  /  Composites
vehicles. Surface areas of nanocomposite electrodes that are in contact with the 
lithium electrolyte are greater than for conventional electrodes. Battery capacity is higher, life cycles are longer, and double the power is available at high charge/discharge rates when graphene nanocomposite anodes are used.
• Flame-barrier coatings —Thin coatings composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes 
dispersed in silicone matrices exhibit outstanding fl  ame barrier characteristics (i.e., protection from combustion and decomposition). In addition, they offer abrasion and scratch resistance; do not produce toxic gases; and are extremely adherent to most glass, metal, wood, plastic, and composite surfaces. Flame-barrier coatings are used in aerospace, aviation, electronic, and industrial applications, and are typically applied on wires and cables, foams, fuel tanks, and reinforced composites.
• Dental restorations —Some newly developed dental restoration (i.e., fi  lling) materi-
als are polymer nanocomposites. Nano-fi  ller ceramic materials used include silica nanoparticles (approximately 20 nm in diameter), and nanoclusters composed of loosely bound agglomerates composed of nano-size particles of both silica and zirconia. Most polymer matrix materials belong to the dimethacrylate family. These nanocomposite restoration materials have high fracture toughnesses, are wear resistant, have short curing times and curing shrinkages, and can be made to have the color and appearance of natural teeth.
• Mechanical strength enhancements —High-strength and lightweight polymer 
nanocomposites are produced by the addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes into epoxy resins; nanotube contents that range between 20 and 30 wt% are normally required. These nanocomposites are used in wind turbine blades as well as some sports equipment (viz. tennis rackets, baseball bats, golf clubs, skis, bicycle frames, and boat hulls and masts).
• Electrostatic dissipation —The motion of highly fl  ammable fuels in automotive 
and aircraft polymer fuel lines can lead to the production of static charges. If not eliminated, these charges pose the risk of spark generation and the possibility of explosion. However, dissipation of such charge buildups can occur if the fuel lines are made electrically conductive. Adequate conductivities may be achieved by incorporating multi-walled carbon nanotubes into the polymer. Loading contents as high as 15 to 20 wt% are required, which normally do not compromise other polymer properties.
 The number of commercial applications of nanocomposites is accelerating rapidly, and we can look forward to an explosion in the number and diversity of future nano-composites. Production techniques will improve and, in addition to polymers, metallic- and ceramic-matrix nanoncomposite materials will undoubtedly be developed. Nanocomposite products will find their way into a number of commercial sectors [e.g., fuel cells, solar cells, drug delivery, biomedical, electronic, opto-electronic, and automo-tive (lubricants, body and under-hood structures, scratch-free paints)].
SUMMARY
• Composites are artificially produced multiphase materials with desirable combina-
tions of the best properties of the constituent phases.
• Usually, one phase (the matrix) is continuous and completely surrounds the other 
(the dispersed phase).
• In this discussion, composites were classified as particle-reinforced, fiber-reinforced, 
structural, and nanocomposites.Introduction
• Large-particle and dispersion-strengthened composites fall within the particle- 
reinforced classification.
• For dispersion strengthening, improved strength is achieved by extremely small 
particles of the dispersed phase, which inhibit dislocation motion.
• The particle size is normally greater with large-particle composites, whose mechanical 
characteristics are enhanced by reinforcement action.
• For large-particle composites, upper and lower elastic modulus values depend on the 
moduli and volume fractions of matrix and particulate phases according to the rule-
of-mixtures expressions Equations 16.1 and 16.2.
• Concrete, a type of large-particle composite, consists of an aggregate of particles 
bonded together with cement. In the case of Portland cement concrete, the aggregate consists of sand and gravel; the cementitious bond develops as a result of chemical reactions between the Portland cement and water.
• The mechanical strength of concrete may be improved by reinforcement methods 
(e.g., embedment into the fresh concrete of steel rods, wires).
• Of the several composite types, the potential for reinforcement efficiency is greatest 
for those that are fiber reinforced.
• With fiber-reinforced composites, an applied load is transmitted to and distributed 
among the fibers via the matrix phase, which in most cases is at least moderately ductile.
• Significant reinforcement is possible only if the fiber–matrix bond is strong. Because 
reinforcement discontinues at the fiber extremities, reinforcement efficiency depends on fiber length.
• For each fiber–matrix combination, there exists some critical length ( l
c), which de-
pends on fiber diameter and strength and fiber–matrix bond strength according to Equation 16.3.
• The length of continuous fibers greatly exceeds this critical value (i.e., l > 15l
c), 
whereas shorter fibers are discontinuous.
• On the basis of fiber length and orientation, three different types of fiber-reinforced 
composites are possible:
Continuous and aligned (Figure 16.8 a)—mechanical properties are highly aniso-
tropic. In the alignment direction, reinforcement and strength are a maximum; perpendicular to the alignment, they are a minimum.
Discontinuous and aligned (Figure 16.8 b)—significant strengths and stiffnesses 
are possible in the longitudinal direction.
Discontinuous and randomly oriented (Figure 16.8 c)—despite some limitations 
on reinforcement efficiency, properties are isotropic.
• For continuous and aligned composites, rule-of-mixtures expressions for the modulus 
in both longitudinal and transverse orientations were developed (Equations 16.10 and 16.16). In addition, an equation for longitudinal strength was also cited (Equation 16.17).
• For discontinuous and aligned composites, composite strength equations were pre-
sented for two different situations:
When l > l
c, Equation 16.18 is valid.
When l < lc, it is appropriate to use Equation 16.19.
• The elastic modulus for discontinuous and randomly oriented fibrous composites may 
be determined using Equation 16.20.Large-Particle

• On the basis of diameter and material type, fiber reinforcements are classified as follows:
Whiskers—extremely strong single crystals that have very small diameters
Fibers—normally polymers or ceramics that may be either amorphous or 
polycrystalline
Wires—metals/alloys that have relatively large diameters
• Although all three basic material types are used for matrices, the most common are 
polymers and metals.
• The matrix phase normally performs three functions:
It binds the fibers together and transmits an externally applied load to the fibers.It protects the individual fibers from surface damage.It prevents the propagation of cracks from fiber to fiber.
• Fibrous reinforced composites are sometimes classified according to matrix type; within 
this scheme are three classifications: polymer-, metal-, and ceramic-matrix composites.
• Polymer-matrix composites are the most common; they may be reinforced with glass, 
carbon, and aramid fibers.
• Service temperatures are higher for metal-matrix composites (MMCs) than for 
polymer-matrix composites. MMCs also use a variety of fiber and whisker types.
• With ceramic-matrix composites, the design goal is increased fracture toughness. 
This is achieved by interactions between advancing cracks and dispersed-phase particles.
• Transformation toughening is one such technique for improving K
Ic.
• Carbon–carbon composites are composed of carbon fibers embedded in a pyrolyzed 
carbon matrix.
• These materials are expensive and used in applications requiring high strengths and 
stiffnesses (that are retained at elevated temperatures), resistance to creep, and good fracture toughnesses.
• The hybrid composites contain at least two different fiber types. By using hybrids, it 
is possible to design composites having better all-around sets of properties.
• Several composite processing techniques have been developed that provide a uniform 
fiber distribution and a high degree of alignment.
• With pultrusion, components of continuous length and constant cross section are 
formed as resin-impregnated fiber tows are pulled through a die.
• Composites used for many structural applications are commonly prepared using a lay-
up operation (either hand or automated), in which prepreg tape plies are laid down on a tooled surface and are subsequently fully cured by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure.
• Some hollow structures may be fabricated using automated filament winding proce-
dures, by which resin-coated strands or tows or prepreg tape are continuously wound onto a mandrel, followed by a curing operation.
• Two general kinds of structural composites were discussed: laminar composites and 
sandwich panels.
• Laminar composites are composed of a set of two-dimensional sheets that are bonded 
to one another; each sheet has a high-strength direction.The Fiber Phase

Summary  •   605
In-plane laminate properties depend on layer-to-layer high-strength-direction 
sequencing—in this regard, there are four laminate types: unidirectional, cross-
ply, angle-ply, and multidirectional. Multidirectional laminates are the most iso-tropic, whereas unidirectional laminates have the highest degree of anisotropy.
One common laminate material is unidirectional prepreg tape, which can conveni-
ently be laid-up in predetermined high-strength orientations.
• Sandwich panels consist of two strong and stiff sheet faces that are separated by a 
core material or structure. These structures combine relatively high strengths and stiffnesses with low densities.
Common core types are rigid polymeric foams, low-density woods, and honey-
comb structures.
Honeycomb structures are composed of interlocking cells (often having hexagonal 
geometry) made of thin foils; cell axes are oriented perpendicular to the facing sheets.
• Most of the construction of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses low-density composite 
materials (i.e., honeycomb structures and continuous carbon fiber–epoxy resin laminates).
• Nanocomposites—nanomaterials embedded in a matrix (most often a polymer)—use 
the unusual properties of nanosized particles.
• Nanoparticle types include nanocarbons, nanoclays, and particulate nanocrystals.
• Uniform and homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles within the matrix is the 
 major production challenge for nanocomposites.Nanocomposites

Chapter 5  Diffusion
With knowledge of the types and an  understanding 
of the mechanisms and causes of corrosion and  degradation, it is possible to take measures to prevent them from  occurring. For example, we may change the nature of the environment, select a material that is relatively nonreactive, and/or protect the material from appreciable deterioration.WHY STUDY Corrosion and Degradation of Materials?
To one degree or another, most materials experience some type of interaction with 
a large number of diverse environments. Often, such interactions impair a material’s  usefulness as a result of the deterioration of its mechanical properties (e.g., ductility and strength), other physical properties, or appearance. Occasionally, to the chagrin of a design engineer, the degradation behavior of a material for some application is ignored, with adverse consequences. Deteriorative mechanisms are different for the three material types. In  metals, there is actual material loss either by dissolution (corrosion) or by the formation of 
nonmetallic scale or film (oxidation). Ceramic materials are relatively resistant to 
deterioration, which usually occurs at elevated temperatures or in rather  extreme environments; the process is frequently also called corrosion. For polymers, mecha-nisms and consequences differ from those for metals and ceramics, and the term 
degradation is most frequently used. Polymers may dissolve when exposed to a 
liquid solvent, or they may absorb the solvent and swell; also, electromagnetic radiation (primarily ultraviolet) and heat may cause alterations in their molecular structures. The deterioration of each of these material types is discussed in this chapter with special regard to mechanism, resistance to attack by various environments, and  measures to prevent or reduce degradation.

17.2 Electrochemical Considerations  •   609
Corrosion is defined as the destructive and unintentional attack on a metal; it is 
 electrochemical and ordinarily begins at the surface. The problem of metallic corrosion is significant; in economic terms, it has been estimated that approximately 5% of an industrialized nation’s income is spent on corrosion prevention and the maintenance or replacement of products lost or contaminated as a result of corrosion reactions. The consequences of corrosion are all too common. Familiar examples include the rusting of automotive body panels and radiator and exhaust components. Corrosion processes are occasionally used to advantage. For example, etching procedures, as discussed in Section 4.10, use the selective chemical reactivity of grain boundaries or various microstructural constituents.Corrosion of Metals
For metallic materials, the corrosion process is normally electrochemical, that is, a chemical reaction in which there is transfer of electrons from one chemical species to another. Metal atoms characteristically lose or give up electrons in what is called an 
oxidation reaction. For example, a hypothetical metal M that has a valence of n (or n valence electrons) may experience oxidation according to the reaction
 
M→ Mn++ne− (17.1)
in which M becomes an n+ positively charged ion and in the process loses its n  valence 
electrons; e− is used to symbolize an electron. Examples in which metals oxidize are
 Fe → Fe2++2e− (17.2a)
 Al → Al3++3e− (17.2b)
The site at which oxidation takes place is called the anode; oxidation is sometimes called 
an anodic reaction.
 The electrons generated from each metal atom that is oxidized must be transferred to and become a part of another chemical species in what is termed a reduction reaction. 
For example, some metals undergo corrosion in acid solutions, which have a high  concentration of hydrogen (H
+) ions; the H+ ions are reduced as follows:
 2H++2e−→ H2 (17.3)
and hydrogen gas (H2) is evolved.
 Other reduction reactions are possible, depending on the nature of the solution to which the metal is exposed. For an acid solution having dissolved oxygen, reduction  according to
 
O2+4H++4e−→ 2H2O  (17.4)
will probably occur. For a neutral or basic aqueous solution in which oxygen is 
also  dissolved,
 O2+2H2O+4e−→ 4(OH−)  (17.5)oxidation

Any metal ions present in the solution may also be reduced; for ions that can exist in 
more than one valence state (multivalent ions), reduction may occur by
 Mn++e−→ M(n−1)+ (17.6)
in which the metal ion decreases its valence state by accepting an electron. A metal may 
be totally reduced from an ionic to a neutral metallic state according to
 Mn++ne−→ M  (17.7)
The location at which reduction occurs is called the cathode. It is possible for two or 
more of the preceding reduction reactions to occur simultaneously.
 An overall electrochemical reaction must consist of at least one oxidation and one reduction reaction and will be their sum; often the individual oxidation and reduction reactions are termed half-reactions.  There can be no net electrical charge  accumulation 
from the electrons and ions—that is, the total rate of oxidation must equal the total rate of reduction, or all electrons generated through oxidation must be consumed by reduction. For example, consider zinc metal immersed in an acid solution containing H
+ ions. 
At some regions on the metal surface, zinc will experience oxidation or corrosion as  illustrated in Figure 17.1, according to the reaction
 Zn→ Zn2++2e− (17.8)
Because zinc is a metal and therefore a good electrical conductor, these electrons may 
be transferred to an adjacent region at which the H+ ions are reduced according to
 2H++2e−→ H2 (gas) (17.9)
If no other oxidation or reduction reactions occur, the total electrochemical reaction is just the sum of reactions 17.8 and 17.9, or
 Zn→ Zn2++2e−
 2H++2e− → H2 (gas)
 Zn +2H+ → Zn2++H2 (gas) (17.10)
 Another example is the oxidation or rusting of iron in water, which contains 
 dissolved oxygen. This process occurs in two steps; in the first, Fe is oxidized to Fe2+ [as 
Fe(OH)2],
 Fe +1
2O2+H2O→ Fe2++2OH−→ Fe(OH)2 (17.11)
and, in the second stage, to Fe3+ [as Fe(OH)3] according to
 2Fe(OH)2+1
2O2+H2O→ 2Fe(OH)3 (17.12)
The compound Fe(OH)3 is the all-too-familiar rust.
 As a consequence of oxidation, the metal ions may either go into the corroding  solution as ions (reaction 17.8) or form an insoluble compound with nonmetallic  elements as in reaction 17.12.Reduction of a 
 multivalent metal ion to a lower valence state

17.2 Electrochemical Considerations  •   611
Electrode Potentials
Not all metallic materials oxidize to form ions with the same degree of ease. Consider 
the electrochemical cell shown in Figure 17.2. On the left-hand side is a piece of pure iron immersed in a solution containing Fe
2+ ions of 1 M concentration.1 The other side 
of the cell consists of a pure copper electrode in a 1 M solution of Cu2+ ions. The cell 
halves are separated by a membrane, which limits the mixing of the two solutions. If the iron and copper electrodes are connected electrically, reduction will occur for copper at the expense of the oxidation of iron, as follows:
 Cu
2++Fe→ Cu+Fe2+ (17.13)
or Cu2+ ions will deposit (electrodeposit) as metallic copper on the copper electrode, 
whereas iron dissolves (corrodes) on the other side of the cell and goes into solution as 
Fe2+ ions. Thus, the two half-cell reactions are represented by the relations
  Fe→ Fe2++2e− (17.14a)
  Cu2++2e−→ Cu  (17.14b)
When a current passes through the external circuit, electrons generated from the oxidation of iron flow to the copper cell in order that Cu
2+ be reduced. In addition, there will be 
some net ion motion from each cell to the other across the membrane. This is called a galvanic couple —two metals electrically connected in a liquid electrolyte in which one 
metal becomes an anode and corrodes while the other acts as a cathode. An electric potential or voltage exists between the two cell halves, and its magni-tude can be determined if a voltmeter is connected in the external circuit. A potential 
of 0.780 V results for a copper–iron galvanic cell when the temperature is 25 °C (77° F).electrolyte

 Now consider another galvanic couple consisting of the same iron half-cell connected 
to a metal zinc electrode that is immersed in a 1 M solution of Zn2+ ions (Figure 17.3). In 
this case, the zinc is the anode and corrodes, whereas the Fe becomes the cathode. The electrochemical reaction is thus
 Fe
2++Zn→ Fe+Zn2+ (17.15)
The potential associated with this cell reaction is 0.323 V.
 Thus, various electrode pairs have different voltages; the magnitude of such a voltage may be thought of as representing the driving force for the electrochemical oxidation–reduction reaction. Consequently, metallic materials may be rated as to their tendency to experience oxidation when coupled to other metals in solutions of their respective ions. A half-cell similar to those just described [i.e., a pure metal electrode immersed in a 1 M solution of its ions and at 25°C (77°F)] is termed a  standard half-cell.
The Standard emf Series
These measured cell voltages represent only differences in electrical potential, and thus it is convenient to establish a reference point, or reference cell, to which other cell halves may be compared. This reference cell, arbitrarily chosen, is the standard hydrogen elec-trode (Figure 17.4). It consists of an inert platinum electrode in a 1 M solution of H
+ ions 
saturated with hydrogen gas that is bubbled through the solution at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 25° C (77° F). The platinum itself does not take part in the electrochemical 
reaction; it acts only as a surface on which hydrogen atoms may be oxidized or hydrogen ions may be reduced. The electromotive force (emf) series (Table 17.1) is generated by 
coupling the standard hydrogen electrode to standard half-cells for various metals and ranking them according to measured voltage. Table 17.1 shows the corrosion tendencies for the several metals; those at the top (i.e., gold and platinum) are noble, or chemically 
inert. As one moves down the table, the metals become increasingly more active —that is, 
more susceptible to oxidation. Sodium and potassium have the highest reactivities.standard half-cell

The Standard emf 
Series
 The voltages in Table 17.1 are for the half-reactions as reduction reactions, with the 
electrons on the left-hand side of the chemical equation; for oxidation, the direction of the reaction is reversed and the sign of the voltage changed. Consider the generalized reactions involving the oxidation of metal M
1 and the 
reduction of metal M2 as
  M1→ Mn+
1+ne− −V0
1 (17.16a)
  Mn+
2+ne−→ M2 +V0
2 (17.16b)
where the V0s are the standard potentials as taken from the standard emf series. Because 
metal M1 is oxidized, the sign of V0
1 is opposite to that as it appears in Table 17.1. 
Addition of Equations 17.16a and 17.16b yields
 M1+Mn+
2→ M1n++M2 (17.17)
and the overall cell potential Δ V0 is
 ΔV0=V0
2−V0

 For this reaction to occur spontaneously, ΔV0 must be positive; if it is negative, the 
spontaneous cell direction is the reverse of Equation 17.17. When standard half-cells 
are coupled together, the metal that lies lower in Table 17.1 experiences oxidation (i.e., corrosion), whereas the higher one is reduced.Electrochemical cell

Influence of Concentration and Temperature on Cell Potential
The emf series applies to highly idealized electrochemical cells (i.e., pure metals in 1 M 
solutions of their ions at 25°C). Altering temperature or solution concentration or using 
alloy electrodes instead of pure metals changes the cell potential, and, in some cases, the spontaneous reaction direction may be reversed. Consider again the electrochemical reaction described by Equation 17.17. If M

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 17.1
Determination of Electrochemical Cell Characteristics
One-half of an electrochemical cell consists of a pure nickel electrode in a solution of Ni2+ ions; 
the other half is a cadmium electrode immersed in a Cd2+ solution.
(a)  If the cell is a standard one, write the spontaneous overall reaction and calculate the voltage 
that is generated.
(b)  Compute the cell potential at 25° C if the Cd2+ and Ni2+ concentrations are 0.5 and 
10−3 M, respectively. Is the spontaneous reaction direction still the same as for the 
standard cell?
Solution
(a)  The cadmium electrode is oxidized and nickel is reduced because cadmium is lower in the 
emf series; thus, the spontaneous reactions are
Cd→ Cd2++2e−
Ni2++2e−→ Ni
 Ni2++Cd→ Ni+Cd2+ (17.21)
17.3 Corrosion Rates  •   615
The Galvanic Series
Even though Table 17.1 was generated under highly idealized conditions and has limited 
utility, it nevertheless indicates the relative reactivities of the metals. A more realistic and practical ranking is provided by the galvanic series,  Table 17.2. This represents the 
relative reactivities of a number of metals and commercial alloys in seawater. The alloys near the top are cathodic and unreactive, whereas those at the bottom are most anodic; no voltages are provided. Comparison of the standard emf and the galvanic series reveals a high degree of correspondence between the relative positions of the pure base metals. Most metals and alloys are subject to oxidation or corrosion to one degree or another in a wide variety of environments—that is, they are more stable in an ionic state than as metals. In thermodynamic terms, there is a net decrease in free energy in going from me-tallic to oxidized states. Consequently, essentially all metals occur in nature as compounds—for example, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, silicates, sulfides, and sulfates. Two excep-tions are the noble metals gold and platinum, for which oxidation in most environments is not favorable, and, therefore, they may exist in nature in the metallic state.galvanic series  From Table 17.1, the half-cell potentials for cadmium and nickel are, respectively, 
−0.403 and −0.250 V. Therefore, from Equation 17.18,
  ΔV=V0
Ni−V0Cd=−0.250 V−(−0.403 V)=+0.153 V
(b) For this portion of the problem, Equation 17.20 must be used, because the half-cell solution 
concentrations are no longer 1 M. At this point, it is necessary to make a calculated guess as 
to which metal species is oxidized (or reduced). This choice will either be affirmed or refuted 
on the basis of the sign of Δ V at the conclusion of the computation. For the sake of argument, 
let us assume that in contrast to part (a), nickel is oxidized and cadmium reduced according to
 Cd2++Ni→ Cd+Ni2+ (17.22)
 Thus,
ΔV =(V0

[Cd2+]
 =−0.403 V−(−0.250 V)−0.0592
2 log(10−3
0.50)
 =−0.073 V
 Because ΔV is negative, the spontaneous reaction direction is the opposite to that of 
Equation 17.22, or
Ni2++Cd→ Ni+Cd2+
 That is, cadmium is oxidized and nickel is reduced.
The half-cell potentials listed in Table 17.1 are thermodynamic parameters that relate to systems at equilibrium. For example, for the discussions pertaining to Figures 17.2 and 17.3, it was tacitly assumed that there was no current flow through the external circuit. Real  corroding systems are not at equilibrium; there is a flow of electrons from anode to cathode (corresponding to the short-circuiting of the electrochemical cells in Figures 17.2 and 17.3), which means that the half-cell potential parameters (Table 17.1) cannot be applied. Furthermore, these half-cell potentials represent the magnitude of a driving force, or the tendency for the occurrence of the particular half-cell reaction. However,  although these potentials may be used to determine spontaneous reaction directions, 17.3 CORROSION RATES

they provide no information on corrosion rates. That is, even though a ΔV potential 
computed for a specific corrosion situation using Equation 17.20 is a relatively large 
positive number, the reaction may occur at only an insignificantly slow rate. From an  engineering perspective, we are interested in predicting the rates at which systems  corrode; this requires the use of other parameters, as discussed next. The corrosion rate, or the rate of material removal as a consequence of the chemical action, is an important corrosion parameter. This may be expressed as the corrosion 
penetration rate (CPR), or the thickness loss of material per unit of time. The formula 
for this calculation is

the system of units used. The CPR is conveniently expressed in terms of either mils per year (mpy) or millimeters per year (mm/yr). In the first case, K = 534 to give CPR in mpy 
(where 1 mil = 0.001 in.), and W, 𝜌, A, and t are specified in units of milligrams, grams 
per cubic centimeter, square inches, and hours, respectively. In the second case, K = 87.6 
for mm/yr, and units for the other parameters are the same as for mils per year, except that A is given in square centimeters. For most applications, a corrosion penetration rate 
less than about 20 mpy (0.50 mm/yr) is acceptable. The following table is a summary of units for the two corrosion penetration rate schemes:

 Inasmuch as there is an electric current associated with electrochemical corrosion 
reactions, we can also express corrosion rate in terms of this current, or, more specifically, current density—that is, the current per unit surface area of material corroding—which is designated i. The rate r , in units of mol/m
2·s, is determined using the expression
 r=i

where, again, n is the number of electrons associated with the ionization of each metal atom and ℱ is 96,500 C/mol.Expression relating

Polarization
Consider the standard Zn/H2 electrochemical cell shown in Figure 17.5, which has been 
short-circuited such that oxidation of zinc and reduction of hydrogen occurs at their 
respective electrode surfaces. The potentials of the two electrodes are not at the values determined from Table 17.1 because the system is now a nonequilibrium one. The dis-placement of each electrode potential from its equilibrium value is termed polarization, 
and the magnitude of this displacement is the overvoltage, normally represented by the 
symbol 𝜂. Overvoltage is expressed in terms of plus or minus volts (or millivolts) relative 
to the equilibrium potential. For example, suppose that the zinc electrode in Figure 17.5 has a potential of −0.621 V after it has been connected to the platinum electrode. The equilibrium potential is −0.763 V (Table 17.1), and, therefore,
𝜂=−0.621 V−(−0.763 V)=+0.142 V
 There are two types of polarization—activation and concentration. We now discuss their mechanisms because they control the rate of electrochemical reactions.
Activation Polarization
 All electrochemical reactions consist of a sequence of steps that occur in series at the  interface between the metal electrode and the electrolyte solution. Activation polarization  polarization

 refers to the condition in which the reaction rate is controlled by the one step in the 
series that occurs at the slowest rate. The term activation is applied to this type of polarization because an activation energy barrier is associated with this slowest, rate-limiting step. To illustrate, let us consider the reduction of hydrogen ions to form bubbles of hydrogen gas on the surface of a zinc electrode (Figure 17.6). It is conceivable that this reaction could proceed by the following step sequence:
 1. Migration of hydrogen ions in solution to and adsorption onto the zinc surface
 2. Motion of electrons to the interface 3. Electron transfer from the zinc to form a hydrogen atom, 
H
++e−→ H
 4. Combining of two hydrogen atoms to form a molecule of hydrogen

 5. The coalescence of many hydrogen molecules to form a bubble
The slowest of these steps determines the rate of the overall reaction.
 For activation polarization, the relationship between overvoltage 𝜂a and current 
density i is
  𝜂a=±    𝛽 log i
i0 (17.25)
where 𝛽 and i0 are constants for the particular half-cell. The parameter i0 is termed 
the exchange current density, which deserves a brief explanation. Equilibrium for 
some particular half-cell reaction is really a dynamic state on the atomic level—that is, oxidation and reduction processes are occurring, but both at the same rate, so that For activation

there is no net reaction. For example, for the standard hydrogen cell (Figure 17.4), 
reduction of hydrogen ions in solution takes place at the surface of the platinum electrode according to

with a corresponding rate rred. Similarly, hydrogen gas in the solution experiences 
 oxidation as

rred=roxid
This exchange current density is just the current density from Equation 17.24 at equi-librium, or
 
rred=roxid=i0
nℱ (17.26)
Use of the term current density for i0 is a little misleading inasmuch as there is no net 
current. Furthermore, the value for i0 is determined experimentally and varies from 
system to system.
 According to Equation 17.25, when overvoltage is plotted as a function of the loga-rithm of current density, straight-line segments result; these are shown in Figure 17.7 for the hydrogen electrode. The line segment with a slope of +𝛽 corresponds to the oxida-
tion half-reaction, whereas the line with a −𝛽 slope is for reduction. Also worth noting 
is that both line segments originate at i
0 (H2/H+), the exchange current density, and at 
zero overvoltage, because at this point the system is at equilibrium and there is no net reaction.
Concentration Polarization
 Concentration polarization exists when the reaction rate is limited by diffusion in the solution. For example, consider again the hydrogen evolution reduction reaction. When the reaction rate is low and/or the concentration of H
+ is high, there is always 
an adequate supply of hydrogen ions available in the solution at the region near the At equilibrium,

electrode interface (Figure 17.8a ). However, at high rates and/or low H+ concentra-
tions, a depletion zone may be formed in the vicinity of the interface because the H+ 
ions are not replenished at a rate sufficient to keep up with the reaction (Figure 17.8 b). 
Thus, diffusion of H+ to the interface is rate controlling, and the system is said to be 
concentration polarized.
 Concentration polarization data are also normally plotted as overvoltage versus the logarithm of current density; such a plot is represented schematically in Figure 17.9 a.

It may be noted from this figure that overvoltage is independent of current density until i approaches i
L; at this point, 𝜂c decreases abruptly in magnitude.
 Both concentration and activation polarization are possible for reduction reactions. Under these circumstances, the total overvoltage is the sum of both overvoltage contri-butions. Figure 17.9b shows such a schematic 𝜂-versus-log i plot.

17.4 Prediction of Corrosion Rates  •   621
Corrosion Rates from Polarization Data
Let us now apply the concepts just developed to the determination of corrosion rates. 
Two types of systems are discussed. In the first case, both oxidation and reduction reac-tions are rate limited by activation polarization. In the second case, both concentration and activation polarization control the reduction reaction, whereas only activation polarization is important for oxidation. Case one will be illustrated by considering the corrosion of a hypothetical divalent metal M immersed in an acid solution (similar to the situation for the corrosion of Zn in Figure 17.1). The reduction of H
+ ions to form H2 gas 
bubbles occurs at the surface of metal M according to reaction 17.3,
2H++2e−→ H2
and metal M oxidizes in a manner similar to zinc as given in reaction 17.8,
M→ M2++2e−
No net charge accumulation may result from these two reactions—that is, all electrons generated by reaction 17.8 must be consumed by reaction 17.3, which is to say that rates of oxidation and reduction must be equal. Activation polarization for both reactions is expressed graphically in Figure 17.10 as cell potential referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (not overvoltage) versus the logarithm of current density.
3 The potentials of the uncoupled hydrogen and M half-
cells, V(H+/H2) and V(M/M2+), respectively, are indicated, along with their respective 
exchange current densities, i0(H+/H2) and i0(M/M2+). Straight-line segments are shown 
for hydrogen reduction and M oxidation. Upon immersion, both hydrogen and M expe-rience activation polarization along their respective lines. Also, oxidation and reduction rates must be equal as explained earlier, which is possible only at the intersection of the two line segments; this intersection occurs at the corrosion potential, designated V
C, and 
the corrosion current density iC. The corrosion rate of M (which also corresponds to 
the rate of hydrogen evolution) may thus be computed by insertion of this iC value into 
Equation 17.24.Figure 17.9  For reduction reactions, schematic plots of overvoltage versus logarithm of current density for

Rate of Oxidation Computation
Zinc experiences corrosion in an acid solution according to the reaction
Zn+2H+→ Zn2++H2
The rates of both oxidation and reduction half-reactions are controlled by activation polarization.
(a) Compute the rate of oxidation of Zn (in mol/cm2·s), given the following activation polari-
zation data:

(b) Compute the value of the corrosion potential. The second corrosion case (combined activation and concentration polarization for 
hydrogen reduction and activation polarization for oxidation of metal M) is treated in a like manner. Figure 17.11 shows both polarization curves; as earlier, corrosion potential and corrosion current density correspond to the point at which the oxidation and reduction lines intersect.
17.4 Prediction of Corrosion Rates  •   623
Solution
(a) To compute the rate of oxidation for Zn, it is first necessary to establish relationships 
in the form of Equation 17.25 for the potential of both oxidation and reduction reac-
tions. Next, we set these two expressions equal to one another, and then we solve for the value of i  that is the corrosion current density, i
C. Finally, the corrosion rate may 
be calculated using Equation 17.24. The two potential expressions are as follows: For hydrogen reduction,
V
H=V(H+∕H2)+𝛽H log(i
i0H)
 and for Zn oxidation,
VZn=V(Zn∕Zn2+)+𝛽Zn log(i
i0Zn)
 Now, setting VH = VZn leads to

Figure 17.12  Schematic polarization curve for a metal 
that displays an active–passive transition.
Under particular environmental conditions, some normally active metals and alloys lose 
their chemical reactivity and become extremely inert. This phenomenon, termed passivity,  
is displayed by chromium, iron, nickel, titanium, and many of their alloys. It is believed that this passive behavior results from the formation of a highly adherent and very thin oxide film on the metal surface, which serves as a protective barrier to further corrosion. Stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion in a rather wide variety of atmospheres as a result of passivation. They contain at least 11% chromium, which as a solid-solution alloying element in iron, minimizes the formation of rust; instead, a protective surface film forms in oxidizing atmospheres. (Stainless steels are susceptible to corrosion in some environments and therefore are not always “stainless.”) Aluminum is highly corrosion resistant in many environments because it also passivates. If damaged, the protective film normally re-forms very rapidly. However, a change in the character of the environment (e.g., alteration in the concentration of the active corrosive species) may cause a pas-sivated material to revert to an active state. Subsequent damage to a preexisting passive film could result in a substantial increase in corrosion rate, by as much as 100,000 times. This passivation phenomenon may be explained in terms of polarization potential–log current density curves discussed in the preceding section. The polarization curve for a metal that passivates has the general shape shown in Figure 17.12. At relatively low potential values, within the “active” region the behavior is linear, as it is for normal metals. With increasing potential, the current density suddenly decreases to a very low value that remains independent of potential; this is termed the “passive” region. Finally, at even higher poten-tial values, the current density again increases with potential in the “transpassive” region. Figure 17.13 illustrates how a metal can experience both active and passive behavior depending on the corrosion environment. This figure shows the S-shaped oxidation polari-zation curve for an active–passive metal M and, in addition, reduction polarization curves for two different solutions, which are labeled 1 and 2. Curve 1 intersects the oxidation po-larization curve in the active region at point A, yielding a corrosion current density i
C(A). 
The intersection of curve 2 at point B  is in the passive region and at current density iC(B). passivity17.5 PASSIVITY
17.7 Forms of Corrosion  •   625
The corrosion rate of metal M in solution 1 is greater than in solution 2 because iC(A) is 
greater than iC(B) and rate is proportional to current density according to Equation 17.24. 
This difference in corrosion rate between the two solutions may be significant—several 
orders of magnitude—given that the current density scale in Figure 17.13 is scaled logarithmically.
The variables in the corrosion environment, which include fluid velocity, temperature, and composition, can have a decided influence on the corrosion properties of the materi-als that are in contact with it. In most instances, increasing fluid velocity enhances the rate of corrosion due to erosive effects, as discussed later in the chapter. The rates of most chemical reactions rise with increasing temperature; this also holds for most cor-rosion situations. Increasing the concentration of the corrosive species (e.g., H
+ ions in 
acids) in many situations produces a more rapid rate of corrosion. However, for materials capable of passivation, raising the corrosive content may result in an active-to-passive transition, with a considerable reduction in corrosion. Cold working or plastically deforming ductile metals is used to increase their strength; however, a cold-worked metal is more susceptible to corrosion than the same material in an annealed state. For example, deformation processes are used to shape the head and point of a nail; consequently, these positions are anodic with respect to the shank region. Thus, differential cold working on a structure should be a consideration when a corrosive environment may be encountered during service.
It is convenient to classify corrosion according to the manner in which it is manifest. 
Metallic corrosion is sometimes classified into eight forms: uniform, galvanic, crevice, pit-ting, intergranular, selective leaching, erosion–corrosion, and stress corrosion. The causes and means of prevention of each of these forms are discussed briefly. In addition, we have elected to discuss the topic of hydrogen embrittlement in this section. Hydrogen embrit-tlement is, in a strict sense, a type of failure rather than a form of corrosion; however, it is often produced by hydrogen that is generated from corrosion reactions.
Uniform Attack
Uniform attack is a form of electrochemical corrosion that occurs with equivalent in-tensity over the entire exposed surface and often leaves behind a scale or deposit. In a microscopic sense, the oxidation and reduction reactions occur randomly over the surface. Familiar examples include general rusting of steel and iron and the tarnishing of silverware. This is probably the most common form of corrosion. It is also the least objectionable because it can be predicted and designed for with relative ease.
Galvanic Corrosion
Galvanic corrosion occurs when two metals or alloys having different compositions are electrically coupled while exposed to an electrolyte. This is the type of corrosion or dissolution that was described in Section 17.2. The less noble or more reactive metal in the particular environment experiences corrosion; the more inert metal, the cathode, is protected from corrosion. As examples, steel screws corrode when in contact with brass in a marine environment, and if copper and steel tubing are joined in a domestic water heater, the steel corrodes in the vicinity of the junction. Depending on the nature of the solution, one or more of the reduction reactions, Equations 17.3 through 17.7, occurs at the surface of the cathode material. Figure 17.14 shows galvanic corrosion.galvanic corrosion17.6 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
17.7 FORMS OF CORROSION
626  •   Chapter 17  /  Corrosion and Degradation of Materials
 The galvanic series in Table 17.2 indicates the relative reactivities in seawater of a 
number of metals and alloys. When two alloys are coupled in seawater, the one lower in the series experiences corrosion. It is also worth noting from this series that some alloys are listed twice (e.g., nickel and the stainless steels), in both active and passive states. The rate of galvanic attack depends on the relative anode-to-cathode surface areas that are exposed to the electrolyte, and the rate is related directly to the cathode–anode area ratio—that is, for a given cathode area, a smaller anode corrodes more rapidly than a larger one because corrosion rate depends on current density (Equation 17.24)—the current per unit area of corroding surface—and not simply the current. Thus, a high current density results for the anode when its area is small relative to that of the cathode. A number of measures may be taken to reduce the effects of galvanic corrosion significantly, including the following:
 1. If coupling of dissimilar metals is necessary, choose two that are close together in 
the galvanic series.
 2. Avoid an unfavorable anode-to-cathode surface area ratio; use an anode area as 
large as possible.
 3. Electrically insulate dissimilar metals from each other.
 4. Electrically connect a third, anodic metal to the other two; this is a form of 
cathodic protection, discussed in Section 17.9.Figure 17.14  Photograph showing galvanic 
corrosion around the inlet of a single-cycle bilge

17.7 Forms of Corrosion  •   627
Crevice Corrosion
Electrochemical corrosion may also occur as a consequence of concentration differ-
ences of ions or dissolved gases in the electrolyte solution and between two regions of the same metal piece. For such a concentration cell, corrosion occurs in the locale that 
has the lower concentration. A good example of this type of corrosion occurs in crevices and recesses or under deposits of dirt or corrosion products where the solution becomes stagnant and there is localized depletion of dissolved oxygen. Corrosion preferentially occurring at these positions is called crevice corrosion (Figure 17.15). The crevice must 
be wide enough for the solution to penetrate yet narrow enough for stagnancy; usually the width is several thousandths of an inch. The proposed mechanism for crevice corrosion is illustrated in Figure 17.16. After oxygen has been depleted within the crevice, oxidation of the metal occurs at this

conducted through the metal to adjacent external regions, where they are consumed by reduction—most probably reaction 17.5. In many aqueous environments, the solution within the crevice has been found to develop high concentrations of H
+ and Cl− ions, 
which are especially corrosive. Many alloys that passivate are susceptible to crevice cor-rosion because protective films are often destroyed by the H
+ and Cl− ions.
 Crevice corrosion may be prevented by using welded instead of riveted or bolted joints, using nonabsorbing gaskets when possible, removing accumulated deposits fre-quently, and designing containment vessels to avoid stagnant areas and ensure complete drainage.
Pitting
Pitting is another form of very localized corrosion attack in which small pits or holes form. They ordinarily penetrate from the top of a horizontal surface downward in a nearly vertical direction. It is an extremely insidious type of corrosion, often going undetected and with very little material loss until failure occurs. An example of pitting corrosion is shown in Figure 17.17. The mechanism for pitting is probably the same as for crevice corrosion, in that oxida-tion occurs within the pit itself, with complementary reduction at the surface. It is supposed that gravity causes the pits to grow downward, the solution at the pit tip becoming more concentrated and dense as pit growth progresses. A pit may be initiated by a localized surface defect such as a scratch or a slight variation in composition. In fact, it has been observed that specimens having polished surfaces display a greater resistance to pitting corrosion. Stainless steels are somewhat susceptible to this form of corrosion; however, alloying with about 2% molybdenum enhances their resistance significantly.pitting
Intergranular Corrosion
As the name suggests, intergranular corrosion occurs preferentially along grain bounda-ries for some alloys and in specific environments. The net result is that a macroscopic specimen disintegrates along its grain boundaries. This type of corrosion is especially prevalent in some stainless steels. When heated to temperatures between 500 °C and 
800°C (950°F and 1450°F) for sufficiently long time periods, these alloys become sensi-tized to intergranular attack. It is believed that this heat treatment permits the forma-tion of small precipitate particles of chromium carbide (Cr
23C6) by reaction between 
the chromium and carbon in the stainless steel. These particles form along the grain boundaries, as illustrated in Figure 17.18. Both the chromium and the carbon must dif-fuse to the grain boundaries to form the precipitates, which leaves a chromium-depleted zone adjacent to the grain boundary. Consequently, this grain boundary region is now highly susceptible to corrosion. Intergranular corrosion is an especially severe problem in the welding of stainless steels, when it is often termed weld decay. Figure 17.19 shows this type of intergranular corrosion.
 Stainless steels may be protected from intergranular corrosion by the following measures: (1) subjecting the sensitized material to a high-temperature heat treatment in which all the chromium carbide particles are redissolved, (2) lowering the carbon intergranular

stainless steel with another metal such as niobium or titanium, which has a greater ten-dency to form carbides than does chromium so that the Cr remains in solid solution.
Selective Leaching
Selective leaching is found in solid solution alloys and occurs when one element or con-stituent is preferentially removed as a consequence of corrosion processes. The most common example is the dezincification of brass, in which zinc is selectively leached from a copper–zinc brass alloy. The mechanical properties of the alloy are significantly impaired because only a porous mass of copper remains in the region that has been dezincified. In addition, the material changes from yellow to a red or copper color. Selective leaching selective leaching
630  •   Chapter 17  /  Corrosion and Degradation of Materials
may also occur with other alloy systems in which aluminum, iron, cobalt, chromium, and 
other elements are vulnerable to preferential removal.
Erosion–Corrosion
Erosion–corrosion arises from the combined action of chemical attack and mechanical abrasion or wear as a consequence of fluid motion. Virtually all metal alloys, to one degree or another, are susceptible to erosion–corrosion. It is especially harmful to alloys that passivate by forming a protective surface film; the abrasive action may erode away the film, leaving exposed a bare metal surface. If the coating is not capable of continu-ously and rapidly re-forming as a protective barrier, corrosion may be severe. Relatively soft metals such as copper and lead are also sensitive to this form of attack. Usually it can be identified by surface grooves and waves having contours that are characteristic of the flow of the fluid. The nature of the fluid can have a dramatic influence on the corrosion behavior. Increasing fluid velocity normally enhances the rate of corrosion. Also, a solution is more erosive when bubbles and suspended particulate solids are present. Erosion–corrosion is commonly found in piping, especially at bends, elbows, and abrupt changes in pipe diameter—positions where the fluid changes direction or flow suddenly becomes turbulent. Propellers, turbine blades, valves, and pumps are also susceptible to this form of corrosion. Figure 17.20 illustrates the impingement failure of an elbow fitting. One of the best ways to reduce erosion–corrosion is to change the design to elimi-nate fluid turbulence and impingement effects. Other materials may also be used that inherently resist erosion. Furthermore, removal of particulates and bubbles from the solution lessens its ability to erode.
Stress Corrosion
Stress corrosion, sometimes termed stress corrosion cracking, results from the combined action of an applied tensile stress and a corrosive environment; both influences are nec-essary. In fact, some materials that are virtually inert in a particular corrosive medium become susceptible to this form of corrosion when a stress is applied. Small cracks form and then propagate in a direction perpendicular to the stress (Figure 17.21), with the result that failure may eventually occur. Failure behavior is characteristic of that for a brittle material, even though the metal alloy is intrinsically ductile. Furthermore, cracks may form at relatively low stress levels, significantly below the tensile strength. Most alloys are susceptible to stress corrosion in specific environments, especially at moderate stress levels. For example, most stainless steels stress corrode in solutions containing chloride ions, whereas brasses are especially vulnerable when exposed to ammonia. Figure 17.22 is a photomicrograph showing an example of intergranular stress corrosion cracking in brass. The stress that produces stress corrosion cracking need not be externally applied; it may be a residual one that results from rapid temperature changes and uneven con-traction or occur for two-phase alloys in which each phase has a different coefficient of expansion. Also, gaseous and solid corrosion products that are entrapped internally can give rise to internal stresses. Probably the best measure to take to reduce or completely eliminate stress corrosion is to lower the magnitude of the stress. This may be accomplished by reducing the external load or increasing the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the applied stress. An appropri-ate heat treatment may be used to anneal out any residual thermal stresses.
Hydrogen Embrittlement
Various metal alloys, specifically some steels, experience a significant reduction in ductility and tensile strength when atomic hydrogen (H) penetrates into the material. erosion–corrosion

This phenomenon is aptly referred to as hydrogen embrittlement; the terms hydrogen-
induced cracking and hydrogen stress cracking are sometimes also used. Strictly speak-
ing, hydrogen embrittlement is a type of failure; in response to applied or residual tensile 
stresses, brittle fracture occurs catastrophically as cracks grow and rapidly propagate. Hydrogen in its atomic form (H as opposed to the molecular form, H
2) diffuses intersti-
tially through the crystal lattice, and concentrations as low as several parts per million can lead to cracking. Furthermore, hydrogen-induced cracks are most often transgranular, although intergranular fracture is observed for some alloy systems. A number of mecha-nisms have been proposed to explain hydrogen embrittlement; most are based on the interference of dislocation motion by the dissolved hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement is similar to stress corrosion, in that a normally ductile metal experiences brittle fracture when exposed to both a tensile stress and a corrosive atmosphere. However, these two phenomena may be distinguished on the basis of their interactions with applied electric currents. Although cathodic protection (Section 17.9) reduces or causes a cessation of stress corrosion, it may lead to the initiation or enhance-ment of hydrogen embrittlement.hydrogen

4Pickling is a procedure used to remove surface oxide scale from steel pieces by dipping them in a vat of hot, dilute 
sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. For hydrogen embrittlement to occur, some source of hydrogen must be present, as 
well as the possibility for the formation of its atomic species. Situations in which these conditions are met include the following: pickling
4 of steels in sulfuric acid, electroplat-
ing, and the presence of hydrogen-bearing atmospheres (including water vapor) at el-evated temperatures such as during welding and heat treatments. Also, the presence of what are termed poisons such as sulfur (i.e., H
2S) and arsenic compounds accelerates 
hydrogen embrittlement; these substances retard the formation of molecular hydrogen and thereby increase the residence time of atomic hydrogen on the metal surface. Hydrogen sulfide, probably the most aggressive poison, is found in petroleum fluids, natural gas, oil well brines, and geothermal fluids. High-strength steels are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement, and increasing strength tends to enhance the material’s susceptibility. Martensitic steels are especially vulnerable to this type of failure; bainitic, ferritic, and spheroiditic steels are more resilient. Furthermore, FCC alloys (austenitic stainless steels and alloys of copper, alu-minum, and nickel) are relatively resistant to hydrogen embrittlement, mainly because of their inherently high ductilities. However, strain hardening these alloys enhances their susceptibility to embrittlement. Techniques commonly used to reduce the likelihood of hydrogen embrittlement in-clude reducing the tensile strength of the alloy via a heat treatment, removing the source of hydrogen, “baking” the alloy at an elevated temperature to drive out any dissolved hydrogen, and substituting a more embrittlement-resistant alloy.

17.9 Corrosion Prevention  •   633
Corrosion environments include the atmosphere, aqueous solutions, soils, acids, bases, 
inorganic solvents, molten salts, liquid metals, and, last but not least, the human body. On a tonnage basis, atmospheric corrosion accounts for the greatest losses. Moisture containing dissolved oxygen is the primary corrosive agent, but other substances, includ-ing sulfur compounds and sodium chloride, may also contribute. This is especially true of marine atmospheres, which are highly corrosive because of the presence of sodium chloride. Dilute sulfuric acid solutions (acid rain) in industrial environments can also cause corrosion problems. Metals commonly used for atmospheric applications include alloys of aluminum and copper, and galvanized steel. Water environments can also have a variety of compositions and corrosion char-acteristics. Freshwater normally contains dissolved oxygen as well as minerals, several of which account for hardness. Seawater contains approximately 3.5% salt (predomi-nantly sodium chloride), as well as some minerals and organic matter. Seawater is generally more corrosive than freshwater, frequently producing pitting and crevice corrosion. Cast iron, steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and some stainless steels are generally suitable for freshwater use, whereas titanium, brass, some bronzes, copper–nickel alloys, and nickel–chromium–molybdenum alloys are highly corrosion resistant in seawater. Soils have a wide range of compositions and susceptibilities to corrosion. Compositional variables include moisture, oxygen, salt content, alkalinity, and acidity, as well as the presence of various forms of bacteria. Cast iron and plain carbon steels, both with and without protective surface coatings, are economical for underground structures. Because there are so many acids, bases, and organic solvents, no attempt is made to discuss these solutions in this text. Good references are available that treat these topics in detail.17.8 CORROSION ENVIRONMENTS
Some corrosion prevention methods were treated relative to the eight forms of corro-sion; however, only the measures specific to each of the various corrosion types were discussed. Now, some more general techniques are presented; these include material selection, environmental alteration, design, coatings, and cathodic protection. Perhaps the most common and easiest way of preventing corrosion is through the judicious selection of materials once the corrosion environment has been characterized. Standard corrosion references are helpful in this respect. Here, cost may be a significant factor. It is not always economically feasible to employ the material that provides the optimum corrosion resistance; sometimes, either another alloy and/or some other mea-sure must be used. Changing the character of the environment, if possible, may also significantly influence corrosion. Lowering the fluid temperature and/or velocity usually produces a reduction in the rate at which corrosion occurs. Often, increasing or decreasing the concentration of some species in the solution will have a positive effect; for example, the metal may experience passivation. Inhibitors are substances that, when added in relatively low concentrations to the 
environment, decrease its corrosiveness. The specific inhibitor depends on both the alloy and the corrosive environment. Several mechanisms may account for the effective-ness of inhibitors. Some react with and virtually eliminate a chemically active species in 
inhibitor17.9 CORROSION PREVENTION
634  •   Chapter 17  /  Corrosion and Degradation of Materials
the solution (such as dissolved oxygen). Other inhibitor molecules attach themselves to 
the corroding surface and interfere with either the oxidation or the reduction reaction or form a very thin protective coating. Inhibitors are normally used in closed systems such as automobile radiators and steam boilers. Several aspects of design consideration have already been discussed, especially with regard to galvanic and crevice corrosion and erosion–corrosion. In addition, the design should allow for complete drainage in the case of a shutdown, and easy washing. Because dissolved oxygen may enhance the corrosivity of many solutions, the design should, if pos-sible, include provision for the exclusion of air. Physical barriers to corrosion are applied on surfaces in the form of films and coat-ings. A large diversity of metallic and nonmetallic coating materials is available. It is es-sential that the coating maintain a high degree of surface adhesion, which undoubtedly requires some preapplication surface treatment. In most cases, the coating must be vir-tually nonreactive in the corrosive environment and resistant to mechanical damage that exposes the bare metal to the corrosive environment. All three material types—metals, ceramics, and polymers—are used as coatings for metals.
Cathodic Protection
One of the most effective means of corrosion prevention is cathodic protection; it can 
be used for all eight different forms of corrosion discussed earlier and in some situations may completely stop corrosion. Again, oxidation or corrosion of a metal M occurs by the generalized reaction 17.1,
M→ Mn++ne−
Cathodic protection simply involves supplying, from an external source, electrons to the metal to be protected, making it a cathode; the preceding reaction is thus forced in the reverse (or reduction) direction. One cathodic protection technique employs a galvanic couple: The metal to be pro-tected is electrically connected to another metal that is more reactive in the particular environment. The latter experiences oxidation and, upon giving up electrons, protects the first metal from corrosion. The oxidized metal is often called a sacrificial anode, 
and magnesium and zinc are commonly used because they lie at the anodic end of the galvanic series. This form of galvanic protection for structures buried in the ground is illustrated in Figure 17.23a. The process of galvanizing is simply one in which a layer of zinc is applied to the surface of steel by hot dipping. In the atmosphere and most aqueous environments, zinc is anodic to and will thus cathodically protect the steel if there is any surface damage (Figure 17.24). Any corrosion of the zinc coating will proceed at an extremely slow rate because the ratio of the anode-to-cathode surface area is quite large. For another method of cathodic protection, the source of electrons is an impressed current from an external dc power source, as represented in Figure 17.23b for an under-ground pipe. The negative terminal of the power source is connected to the structure to be protected. The other terminal is joined to an inert anode (often graphite), which, in this case, is buried in the soil; high-conductivity backfill material provides good electri-cal contact between the anode and the surrounding soil. A current path exists between the cathode and the anode through the intervening soil, completing the electrical circuit. Cathodic protection is especially useful in preventing corrosion of water heaters, under-ground tanks and pipes, and marine equipment.cathodic protection

The discussion of Section 17.2 treated the corrosion of metallic materials in terms of 
electrochemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In addition, oxidation of metal alloys is also possible in gaseous atmospheres, normally air, in which an oxide layer or scale forms on the surface of the metal. This phenomenon is frequently termed scaling, 
tarnishing, or dry corrosion. In this section, we discuss possible mechanisms for this type of corrosion, the types of oxide layers that can form, and the kinetics of oxide formation.
Mechanisms
As with aqueous corrosion, the process of oxide layer formation is an electrochemical one, which may be expressed, for divalent metal M, by the following reaction
5:
 M +1
2 O2→ MO (17.28)
The preceding reaction consists of oxidation and reduction half-reactions. The former, with the formation of metal ions,
 M→ M2++2e− (17.30)
occurs at the metal–scale interface. The reduction half-reaction produces oxygen ions 
as follows:
 1
2 O2+2e−→ O2− (17.31)
and takes place at the scale–gas interface. A schematic representation of this metal–scale–
gas system is shown in Figure 17.25.17.10 OXIDATION

17.10 Oxidation  •   637
 For the oxide layer to increase in thickness via Equation 17.28, it is necessary that 
electrons be conducted to the scale–gas interface, at which point the reduction reaction occurs; in addition, M
2+ ions must diffuse away from the metal–scale interface, and/or 
O2− ions must diffuse toward this same interface (Figure 17.25).6 Thus, the oxide scale 
serves both as an electrolyte through which ions diffuse and as an electrical circuit for the passage of electrons. Furthermore, the scale may protect the metal from rapid oxida-tion when it acts as a barrier to ionic diffusion and/or electrical conduction; most metal oxides are highly electrically insulative.
Scale Types
Rate of oxidation (i.e., the rate of film thickness increase) and the tendency of the film to protect the metal from further oxidation are related to the relative volumes of the oxide and metal. The ratio of these volumes, termed the Pilling–Bedworth ratio, may be 
determined from the following expression
7:
 P−B ratio=AO𝜌M
AM𝜌O (17.32)
where AO is the molecular (or formula) weight of the oxide, AM is the atomic weight 
of the metal, and 𝜌O and 𝜌M are the oxide and metal densities, respectively. For metals 
having P–B ratios less than unity, the oxide film tends to be porous and unprotective because it is insufficient to fully cover the metal surface. If the ratio is greater than unity, compressive stresses result in the film as it forms. For a ratio greater than 2 to 3, the oxide coating may crack and flake off, continually exposing a fresh and unprotected metal surface. The ideal P–B ratio for the formation of a protective oxide film is unity. Table 17.3 presents P–B ratios for metals that form protective coatings and for those that do not. Note from these data that protective coatings normally form for metals having P–B ratios between 1 and 2, whereas nonprotective ones usually result when this ratio is less than 1 or greater than about 2. In addition to the P–B ratio, other factors also influence the oxidation resistance imparted by the film; these include a high degree of adherence between film and metal, comparable coefficients of thermal expansion for metal and oxide, and, for the oxide, a relatively high melting point and good high-temperature plasticity. Several techniques are available for improving the oxidation resistance of a metal. One involves application of a protective surface coating of another material that adheres well to the metal and also is resistant to oxidation. In some instances, the addition of alloying elements will form a more adherent and protective oxide scale by virtue of producing a more favorable Pilling–Bedworth ratio and/or improving other scale char-acteristics.Pilling–Bedworth

Kinetics
One of the primary concerns relative to metal oxidation is the rate at which the reac-
tion progresses. Inasmuch as the oxide scale reaction product normally remains on the surface, the rate of reaction may be determined by measuring the weight gain per unit area as a function of time. When the oxide that forms is nonporous and adheres to the metal surface, the rate of layer growth is controlled by ionic diffusion. A parabolic relationship exists between 
the weight gain per unit area W and the time t as follows:
 
W2=K1t+K2 (17.34)
where K1 and K2 are time-independent constants at a given temperature. This weight 
gain–time behavior is plotted schematically in Figure 17.26. The oxidation of iron, copper, 
and cobalt follows this rate expression.Parabolic rate

Degradation of Polymers
Polymeric materials also experience deterioration by means of environmental inter-
actions. However, an undesirable interaction is specified as degradation rather than corros ion because the processes are basically dissimilar. Whereas most metallic cor-
rosion reactions are electrochemical, polymeric degradation is physiochemical; that is, it involves physical as well as chemical phenomena. Furthermore, a wide variety of reactions and adverse consequences are possible for polymer degradation. Polymers may deteriorate by swelling and dissolution. Covalent bond rupture as a result of heat  In the oxidation of metals for which the scale is porous or flakes off (i.e., for P–B ratios less than about 1 or greater than about 2), the oxidation rate expression is linear— that is,
 
W=K3t (17.35)
where K3 is a constant. Under these circumstances oxygen is always available for reac-
tion with an unprotected metal surface because the oxide does not act as a reaction barrier. Sodium, potassium, and tantalum oxidize according to this rate expression and, incidentally, have P–B ratios significantly different from unity (Table 17.3). Linear growth rate kinetics is also represented in Figure 17.26. A third reaction rate law has been observed for very thin oxide layers (generally less than 100 nm) that form at relatively low temperatures. The dependence of weight gain on time is logarithmic and takes the form
 
W=K4 log(K5t+K6)  (17.36)
Again, the Ks are constants. This oxidation behavior, also shown in Figure 17.26, has 
been observed for aluminum, iron, and copper at near-ambient temperatures.Linear rate

Corrosion of Ceramic Materials
Ceramic materials, being compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements, may 
be thought of as having already been corroded. Thus, they are exceedingly immune to corrosion by almost all environments, especially at room temperature. Corrosion of ceramic materials generally involves simple chemical dissolution, in contrast to the electrochemical processes found in metals, as described previously. Ceramic materials are frequently used because of their resistance to corrosion. Glass is often used to contain liquids for this reason. Refractory ceramics must not only withstand high temperatures and provide thermal insulation, but also, in many instances, must resist high-temperature attack by molten metals, salts, slags, and glasses. Some of the new technology schemes for converting energy from one form into another that is more useful require relatively high temperatures, corrosive  atmospheres, and pressures above the ambient pressure. Ceramic materials are much 
better suited to withstand most of these environments for reasonable time periods than 
are metals.
640  •   Chapter 17  /  Corrosion and Degradation of Materials
17.11 SWELLING AND DISSOLUTION
When polymers are exposed to liquids, the main forms of degradation are swelling and 
dissolution. With swelling, the liquid or solute diffuses into and is absorbed within the polymer; the small solute molecules fit into and occupy positions among the polymer molecules. Thus the macromolecules are forced apart such that the specimen expands or swells. This increase in chain separation results in a reduction of the secondary intermolecular bonding forces; as a consequence, the material becomes softer and more ductile. The liquid solute also lowers the glass transition temperature and, if depressed below the ambient temperature, causes a once-strong material to become rubbery and weak. Swelling may be considered a partial dissolution process in which there is only limited solubility of the polymer in the solvent. Dissolution, which occurs when the polymer is completely soluble, may be thought of as a continuation of swelling. As a rule of thumb, the greater the similarity of chemical structure between the solvent and polymer, the greater the likelihood of swelling and/or dissolution. For example, many hydrocarbon rubbers readily absorb hydrocarbon liquids such as gasoline, but absorb virtually no water. The responses of selected polymeric materials to organic solvents are given in Tables 17.4 and 17.5. Swelling and dissolution traits also are affected by temperature, as well as by the characteristics of the molecular structure. In general, increasing molecular weight, in-creasing degree of crosslinking and crystallinity, and decreasing temperature result in a reduction of these deteriorative processes. In general, polymers are much more resistant to attack by acidic and alkaline solutions than are metals. For example, hydrofluoric acid (HF) can corrode many metals as well as etch and dissolve glass, so it is stored in plastic bottles. A qualitative comparison of the behavior of various polymers in these solutions is also presented in Tables 17.4 and 17.5. Materials that exhibit outstanding resistance to attack by both solution types include polytetrafluoroethylene (and other fluorocarbons) and polyetheretherketone.
Concept Check 17.8 From a molecular perspective, explain why increasing crosslinking 
and crystallinity of a polymeric material will enhance its resistance to swelling and dissolution. Would you expect crosslinking or crystallinity to have the greater infl  uence? Justify your choice. Hint: You may want to consult Sections 14.7 and 14.11.

reduction in mechanical integrity. Because of the chemical complexity of polymers, their degradation mechanisms are not well understood. To cite a couple of examples of polymer degradation, polyethylene, if exposed to high temperatures in an oxygen atmosphere, suffers an impairment of its mechanical properties by becoming brittle, and the utility of poly(vinyl chloride) is limited because this material may become discolored when exposed to high temperatures, although such environments may not affect its mechanical characteristics.

17.12 BOND RUPTURE
Polymers may also experience degradation by a process termed scission —the severance or 
rupture of molecular chain bonds. This causes a separation of chain segments at the point 
of scission and a reduction in the molecular weight. As previously discussed (Chapter 15), several properties of polymeric materials, including mechanical strength and resistance to chemical attack, depend on molecular weight. Consequently, some of the physical and chemical properties of polymers may be adversely affected by this form of degradation. Bond rupture may result from exposure to radiation or heat and from chemical reaction.
Radiation Effects
Certain types of radiation [electron beams, x-rays, 𝛽 - and 𝛾-rays, and ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation] possess sufficient energy to penetrate a polymer specimen and interact with the constituent atoms or their electrons. One such reaction is ionization, in which the radiation removes an orbital electron from a specific atom, converting that atom into a positively charged ion. As a consequence, one of the covalent bonds associated with the specific atom is broken and there is a rearrangement of atoms or groups of atoms at that point. This bond breaking leads to either scission or crosslinking at the ionization site, depending on the chemical structure of the polymer and also on the dose of radiation. Stabilizers (Section 15.22) may be added to protect polymers from radiation damage. In day-to-day use, the greatest radiation damage to polymers is caused by UV irradiation. After prolonged exposure, most polymer films become brittle, discolor, crack, and fail. For example, camping tents begin to tear, dashboards develop cracks, and plastic windows become cloudy. Radiation problems are more severe for some applications. Polymers on space vehicles must resist degradation after prolonged exposures to cosmic radiation. Similarly, polymers used in nuclear reactors must withstand high levels of nuclear radiation. Developing polymeric materials that can withstand these extreme environments is a continuing challenge. Not all consequences of radiation exposure are deleterious. Crosslinking may be induced by irradiation to improve the mechanical behavior and degradation characteris-tics. For example, 𝛾-radiation is used commercially to crosslink polyethylene to enhance 
its resistance to softening and flow at elevated temperatures; indeed, this process may be carried out on products that have already been fabricated.
Chemical Reaction Effects
Oxygen, ozone, and other substances can cause or accelerate chain scission as a result of chemical reaction. This effect is especially prevalent in vulcanized rubbers that have dou-bly bonded carbon atoms along the backbone molecular chains and that are exposed to ozone (O
3), an atmospheric pollutant. One such scission reaction may be represented by
  + C O3 R
HOO C R R′ +O· R′
HC
HC
H+  (17.37)
where the chain is severed at the point of the double bond; R and R′ represent 
groups of atoms that are unaffected during the reaction. Typically, if the rubber is in an unstressed state, an oxide film will form on the surface, protecting the bulk material from any further reaction. However, when these materials are subjected to tensile stresses, cracks and crevices form and grow in a direction perpendicular to the stress; eventually, rupture of the material may occur. This is why the side-walls on rubber bicycle tires develop cracks as they age. Apparently these cracks result from large numbers of ozone-induced scissions. Chemical degradation is a particular problem for polymers used in areas with high levels of air pollutants such as smog and ozone. The elastomers in Table 17.5 are rated as to their resistance to scission

degradation by exposure to ozone. Many of these chain scission reactions involve 
reactive groups termed free radicals. Stabilizers (Section 15.22) may be added to protect polymers from oxidation. The stabilizers either sacrificially react with the ozone to consume it or react with and eliminate the free radicals before the free radicals can inflict more damage.
Thermal Effects
Thermal degradation corresponds to the scission of molecular chains at elevated tem-peratures; as a consequence, some polymers undergo chemical reactions in which gase-ous species are produced. These reactions are evidenced by a weight loss of material; a polymer’s thermal stability is a measure of its resilience to this decomposition. Thermal stability is related primarily to the magnitude of the bonding energies between the vari-ous atomic constituents of the polymer: Higher bonding energies result in more thermally stable materials. For example, the magnitude of the C—F bond is greater than that of the C—H bond, which in turn is greater than that of the C—Cl bond. The fluorocarbons, having C—F bonds, are among the most thermally resistant polymeric materials and may be used at relatively high temperatures. However, because of the weak C—Cl bond, when poly(vinyl chloride) is heated to 200° C for even a few minutes it discolors and 
gives off large amounts of HCl, which accelerates continued  decomposition. Stabilizers 
(Section 15.22) such as ZnO can react with the HCl, providing increased thermal stability 
for poly(vinyl chloride). Some of the most thermally stable polymers are the ladder polymers.

is so thermally stable that a woven cloth of this material can be heated directly in an open flame with no degradation. Polymers of this type are used in place of asbestos for high-temperature gloves.
8The chain structure of a ladder polymer consists of two sets of covalent bonds throughout its length that are 
crosslinked.17.13 WEATHERING
Many polymeric materials serve in applications that require exposure to outdoor condi-tions. Any resultant degradation is termed weathering, which may be a combination of 
several different processes. Under these conditions, deterioration is primarily a result of oxidation, which is initiated by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Some polymers, such as nylon and cellulose, are also susceptible to water absorption, which produces a reduction in their hardness and stiffness. Resistance to weathering among the various polymers is quite diverse. The fluorocarbons are virtually inert under these conditions; some materials, however, including poly(vinyl chloride) and polystyrene, are susceptible to weathering.

SUMMARY
• Metallic corrosion is typically electrochemical, involving both oxidation and reduc-
tion reactions.
Oxidation is the loss of the metal atom’s valence electrons and occurs at the anode; 
the resulting metal ions may either go into the corroding solution or form an 
insoluble compound.
During reduction (which occurs at the cathode), these electrons are transferred to 
at least one other chemical species. The character of the corrosion environment dictates which of several possible reduction reactions will occur.
• Not all metals oxidize with the same degree of ease, which is demonstrated with a 
galvanic couple.
When in an electrolyte, one metal (the anode) will corrode, whereas a reduction 
reaction will occur at the other metal (the cathode).
The magnitude of the electric potential that is established between anode and 
cathode is indicative of the driving force for the corrosion reaction.
• The standard emf and galvanic series are rankings of metallic materials on the basis 
of their tendency to corrode when coupled to other metals.
For the standard emf series, ranking is based on the magnitude of the voltage 
generated when the standard cell of a metal is coupled to the standard hydrogen electrode at 25°C (77°F).
The galvanic series consists of the relative reactivities of metals and alloys in seawater.
• The half-cell potentials in the standard emf series are thermodynamic parameters that 
are valid only at equilibrium; corroding systems are not in equilibrium. Furthermore, the magnitudes of these potentials provide no indication as to the rates at which cor-rosion reactions occur.
• The rate of corrosion may be expressed as corrosion penetration rate, that is, the thick-
ness loss of material per unit of time; CPR may be determined using Equation 17.23. Mils per year and millimeters per year are the common units for this parameter.
• Alternatively, rate is proportional to the current density associated with the electro-
chemical reaction, according to Equation 17.24.
• Corroding systems will experience polarization, which is the displacement of each 
electrode potential from its equilibrium value; the magnitude of the displacement is termed the overvoltage.
• The corrosion rate of a reaction is limited by polarization, of which there are two 
types—activation and concentration.
Activation polarization relates to systems in which the corrosion rate is deter-
mined by the step in a series that occurs most slowly. For activation polariza-tion, a plot of overvoltage versus logarithm of current density will appear as shown in Figure 17.7.Electrochemical

Summary  •   645
Concentration polarization prevails when the corrosion rate is limited by diffusion 
in the solution. When overvoltage versus the logarithm of current density is 
plotted, the resulting curve will appear as shown in Figure 17.9 a.
• The corrosion rate for a particular reaction may be computed using Equation 17.24, 
incorporating the current density associated with the intersection point of oxidation and reduction polarization curves.
• A number of metals and alloys passivate, or lose their chemical reactivity, under some 
environmental circumstances. This phenomenon is thought to involve the formation of a thin protective oxide film. Stainless steels and aluminum alloys exhibit this type of behavior.
• The active-to-passive behavior may be explained by the alloy’s S-shaped electro-
chemical potential-versus-log current density curve (Figure 17.12). Intersections with reduction polarization curves in active and passive regions correspond, respectively, to high and low corrosion rates (Figure 17.13).
• Metallic corrosion is sometimes classified into several different forms:
Uniform attack—degree of corrosion is approximately uniform over the entire 
exposed surface.
Galvanic corrosion—occurs when two different metals or alloys are electrically 
coupled while exposed to an electrolyte solution.
Crevice corrosion—the situation when corrosion occurs under crevices or other 
areas where there is localized depletion of oxygen.
Pitting—a type of localized corrosion in which pits or holes form from the top of 
horizontal surfaces.
Intergranular corrosion—occurs preferentially along grain boundaries for specific 
metals/alloys (e.g., some stainless steels).
Selective leaching—the case in which one element/constituent of an alloy is 
 removed selectively by corrosive action.
Erosion–corrosion—the combined action of chemical attack and mechanical wear 
as a consequence of fluid motion.
Stress corrosion—the formation and propagation of cracks (and possible failure) re-
sulting from the combined effects of corrosion and the application of a tensile stress.
Hydrogen embrittlement—a significant reduction in ductility that accompanies the 
penetration of atomic hydrogen into a metal/alloy.
• Several measures may be taken to prevent, or at least reduce, corrosion. These include 
material selection, environmental alteration, the use of inhibitors, design changes, ap-plication of coatings, and cathodic protection.
• With cathodic protection, the metal to be protected is made a cathode by supplying 
electrons from an external source.
• Oxidation of metallic materials by electrochemical action is also possible in dry, gase-
ous atmospheres (Figure 17.25).
• An oxide film forms on the surface that may act as a barrier to further oxidation if 
the volumes of metal and oxide film are similar, that is, if the Pilling–Bedworth ratio (Equations 17.32 and 17.33) is near unity.
• The kinetics of film formation may follow parabolic (Equation 17.34), linear 
(Equation 17.35), or logarithmic (Equation 17.36) rate laws.
• Ceramic materials, being inherently corrosion resistant, are frequently used at elevated 
temperatures and/or in extremely corrosive environments.Passivity

• Polymeric materials deteriorate by noncorrosive processes. Upon exposure to liquids, 
they may experience degradation by swelling or dissolution.
With swelling, solute molecules actually fit into the molecular structure.
Dissolution may occur when the polymer is completely soluble in the liquid.
• Scission, or the severance of molecular chain bonds, may be induced by radiation, chemical reactions, or heat. This results in a reduction of molecular weight and a deterioration of the physical and chemical properties of the polymer.Degradation of

The prime objective of this chapter is to explore the electrical properties of materials—
that is, their responses to an applied electric field. We begin with the phenomenon of electrical conduction: the parameters by which it is expressed, the mechanism of conduc-tion by electrons, and how the electron energy band structure of a material influences its ability to conduct. These principles are extended to metals, semiconductors, and insula-tors. Particular attention is given to the characteristics of semiconductors and then to semi-conducting devices. The dielectric characteristics of insulating materials are also treated. The final sections are devoted to the phenomena of ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity.18.1 INTRODUCTION
Electrical Conduction
One of the most important electrical characteristics of a solid material is the ease with which it transmits an electric current. Ohm’s law relates the current I —or time rate of 
charge passage—to the applied voltage V as follows:
 
V=IR (18.1)
where R is the resistance of the material through which the current is passing. The units 
for V, I, and R are, respectively, volts (J/C), amperes (C/s), and ohms (V/A). The value 
of R is influenced by specimen configuration and for many materials is independent of Ohm’s law

expression18.2 OHM’S LAWConsideration of the electrical properties of 
materials is often important when materials selection and processing decisions are being made during the design of a component or structure. For example, when we consider an integrated circuit package, the  electrical behaviors of the various materials are diverse. Some need to be highly electrically conductive (e.g., connecting wires), whereas electrical insulativity is required of others  (e.g., protective package encapsulation).

engineering texts.
18.5 Energy Band Structures in Solids   •  651
The demonstration of the equivalence of the two Ohm’s law expressions (Equations 18.1 
and 18.5) is left as a homework exercise. Solid materials exhibit an amazing range of electrical conductivities, extending over 27 orders of magnitude; probably no other physical property exhibits this breadth of variation. In fact, one way of classifying solid materials is according to the ease with which they conduct an electric current; within this classification scheme there are three groupings: conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Metals are good conductors, 
typically having conductivities on the order of 10
7 (Ω·m)−1. At the other extreme are 
materials with very low conductivities, ranging between 10−10 and 10−20 (Ω·m)−1; these 
are electrical insulators. Materials with intermediate conductivities, generally from 10−6 
to 104 (Ω·m)−1, are termed semiconductors. Electrical conductivity ranges for the various 
material types are compared in the bar chart of Figure 1.8.metal
insulator
semiconductor
An electric current results from the motion of electrically charged particles in response 
to forces that act on them from an externally applied electric field. Positively charged particles are accelerated in the field direction, negatively charged particles in the direc-tion opposite. Within most solid materials a current arises from the flow of electrons, which is termed electronic conduction.  In addition, for ionic materials, a net motion of 
charged ions is possible that produces a current; this is termed ionic conduction.  The 
present discussion deals with electronic conduction; ionic conduction is treated briefly in Section 18.16.
ionic conduction18.4 ELECTRONIC AND IONIC CONDUCTION
In all conductors, semiconductors, and many insulating materials, only electronic con-duction exists, and the magnitude of the electrical conductivity is strongly dependent on the number of electrons available to participate in the conduction process. However, not all electrons in every atom accelerate in the presence of an electric field. The number of electrons available for electrical conduction in a particular material is related to the arrangement of electron states or levels with respect to energy and the manner in which these states are occupied by electrons. A thorough exploration of these topics is com-plicated and involves principles of quantum mechanics that are beyond the scope of this book; the ensuing development omits some concepts and simplifies others. Concepts relating to electron energy states, their occupancy, and the resulting elec-tron configurations for isolated atoms were discussed in Section 2.3. By way of review, for each individual atom there exist discrete energy levels that may be occupied by elec-trons, arranged into shells and subshells. Shells are designated by integers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and subshells by letters (s, p , d, and f ). For each of s, p, d, and f subshells, there exist, 
respectively, one, three, five, and seven states. The electrons in most atoms fill only the states having the lowest energies—two electrons of opposite spin per state, in accord-ance with the Pauli exclusion principle. The electron configuration of an isolated atom represents the arrangement of the electrons within the allowed states. Let us now make an extrapolation of some of these concepts to solid materials. A solid may be thought of as consisting of a large number—say, N —of atoms initially sepa-
rated from one another that are subsequently brought together and bonded to form the ordered atomic arrangement found in the crystalline material. At relatively large separa-tion distances, each atom is independent of all the others and has the atomic energy levels and electron configuration as if isolated. However, as the atoms come within close proxim-ity of one another, electrons are acted upon, or perturbed, by the electrons and nuclei of 18.5 ENERGY BAND STRUCTURES IN SOLIDS
652  •   Chapter 18  /  Electrical Properties
adjacent atoms. This influence is such that each distinct atomic state may split into a series 
of closely spaced electron states in the solid to form what is termed an electron energy 
band. The extent of splitting depends on interatomic separation (Figure 18.2) and begins with the outermost electron shells because they are the first to be perturbed as the atoms 
coalesce. Within each band, the energy states are discrete, yet the difference between adja-cent states is exceedingly small. At the equilibrium spacing, band formation may not occur for the electron subshells nearest the nucleus, as illustrated in Figure 18.3b . Furthermore, 
gaps may exist between adjacent bands, as also indicated in the figure; normally, energies lying within these band gaps are not available for electron occupancy. The conventional way of representing electron band structures in solids is shown in Figure 18.3a .electron energy bandFigure 18.2  Schematic plot of

18.6 Conduction in Terms of Band and Atomic Bonding Models   •  653
 The number of states within each band is equal to the total of all states contributed 
by the N atoms. For example, an s band consists of N states and a p band of 3N states. With regard to occupancy, each energy state may accommodate two electrons that must have oppositely directed spins. Furthermore, bands contain the electrons that resided in the corresponding levels of the isolated atoms; for example, a 4 s energy band in the 
solid contains those isolated atoms’ 4 s electrons. Of course, there are empty bands and, 
possibly, bands that are only partially filled. The electrical properties of a solid material are a consequence of its electron band structure—that is, the arrangement of the outermost electron bands and the way in which they are filled with electrons. Four different types of band structures are possible at 0 K. In the first (Figure 18.4a ), 
one outermost band is only partially filled with electrons. The energy corresponding to the highest filled state at 0 K is called the Fermi energy E
f, as indicated. This energy 
band structure is typified by some metals, in particular those that have a single s valence 
electron (e.g., copper). Each copper atom has one 4s electron; however, for a solid com-posed of N atoms, the 4s band is capable of accommodating 2N electrons. Thus, only half of the available electron positions within this 4 s band are filled.
 For the second band structure, also found in metals (Figure 18.4b), there is an overlap of an empty band and a filled band. Magnesium has this band structure. Each isolated Mg atom has two 3 s electrons. However, when a solid is formed, the 3s and 
3p bands overlap. In this instance and at 0 K, the Fermi energy is taken as that energy below which, for N atoms, N states are filled, two electrons per state. The final two band structures are similar; one band (the valence band) that is com-
pletely filled with electrons is separated from an empty conduction band, and an energy 
band gap lies between them. For very pure materials, electrons may not have energies within this gap. The difference between the two band structures lies in the magnitude of the 
energy gap; for materials that are insulators, the band gap is relatively wide (Figure 18.4c ), 
whereas for semiconductors it is narrow (Figure 18.4d ). The Fermi energy for these two 
band structures lies within the band gap—near its center.Fermi energy

18.6  CONDUCTION IN TERMS OF BAND AND ATOMIC 
BONDING MODELS
At this point in the discussion, it is vital that another concept be understood—namely, 
that only electrons with energies greater than the Fermi energy may be acted on and accelerated in the presence of an electric field. These are the electrons that participate 
654  •   Chapter 18  /  Electrical Properties
in the conduction process, which are termed free electrons. Another charged electronic 
entity called a hole is found in semiconductors and insulators. Holes have energies less 
than Ef and also participate in electronic conduction. The ensuing discussion shows 
that the electrical conductivity is a direct function of the numbers of free electrons and 
holes. In addition, the distinction between conductors and nonconductors (insulators and semiconductors) lies in the numbers of these free electron and hole charge carriers.
Metals
For an electron to become free, it must be excited or promoted into one of the empty and available energy states above E
f. For metals having either of the band structures 
shown in Figures 18.4a and 18.4b, there are vacant energy states adjacent to the highest filled state at E
f. Thus, very little energy is required to promote electrons into the low-
lying empty states, as shown in Figure 18.5. Generally, the energy provided by an elec-tric field is sufficient to excite large numbers of electrons into these conducting states. For the metallic bonding model discussed in Section 2.6, it was assumed that all the valence electrons have freedom of motion and form an electron gas that is uniformly 
distributed throughout the lattice of ion cores. Although these electrons are not locally bound to any particular atom, they must experience some excitation to become conduct-ing electrons that are truly free. Thus, although only a fraction are excited, this still gives rise to a relatively large number of free electrons and, consequently, a high conductivity.
Insulators and Semiconductors
For insulators and semiconductors, empty states adjacent to the top of the filled valence band are not available. To become free, therefore, electrons must be promoted across the energy band gap and into empty states at the bottom of the conduction band. This is possible only by supplying to an electron the difference in energy between these two states, which is approximately equal to the band gap energy E
g. This excitation process is demonstrated 
in Figure 18.6.2 For many materials, this band gap is several electron volts wide. Most often 
the excitation energy is from a nonelectrical source such as heat or light, usually the former. The number of electrons excited thermally (by heat energy) into the conduction band depends on the energy band gap width and the temperature. At a given tempera-ture, the larger the E
g, the lower the probability that a valence electron will be promoted 
into an energy state within the conduction band; this results in fewer conduction elec-trons. In other words, the larger the band gap, the lower the electrical conductivity at a given temperature. Thus, the distinction between semiconductors and insulators lies free electron

in the width of the band gap; for semiconductors, it is narrow, whereas for insulating 
materials, it is relatively wide. Increasing the temperature of either a semiconductor or an insulator results in an in-crease in the thermal energy that is available for electron excitation. Thus, more electrons are promoted into the conduction band, which gives rise to an enhanced conductivity. The conductivity of insulators and semiconductors may also be viewed from the per-spective of atomic bonding models discussed in Section 2.6. For electrically insulating ma-terials, interatomic bonding is ionic or strongly covalent. Thus, the valence electrons are tightly bound to or shared with the individual atoms. In other words, these electrons are highly localized and are not in any sense free to wander throughout the crystal. The bond-ing in semiconductors is covalent (or predominantly covalent) and relatively weak, which means that the valence electrons are not as strongly bound to the atoms. Consequently, these electrons are more easily removed by thermal excitation than they are for insulators.Figure 18.6  For an insulator or

When an electric field is applied, a force is brought to bear on the free electrons; as a con-
sequence, they all experience an acceleration in a direction opposite to that of the field, by virtue of their negative charge. According to quantum mechanics, there is no interaction between an accelerating electron and atoms in a perfect crystal lattice. Under such circum-stances, all the free electrons should accelerate as long as the electric field is applied, which would give rise to an electric current that is continuously increasing with time. However, we know that a current reaches a constant value the instant that a field is applied, indicat-ing that there exist what might be termed  frictional forces, which counter this acceleration 
from the external field. These frictional forces result from the scattering of electrons by imperfections in the crystal lattice, including impurity atoms, vacancies, interstitial atoms, dislocations, and even the thermal vibrations of the atoms themselves. Each scattering event causes an electron to lose kinetic energy and to change its direction of motion, as represented schematically in Figure 18.7. There is, however, some net electron motion in the direction opposite to the field, and this flow of charge is the electric current. The scattering phenomenon is manifested as a resistance to the passage of an elec-tric current. Several parameters are used to describe the extent of this scattering; these include the drift velocity and the mobility of an electron. The drift velocity 𝜐
d represents 
the average electron velocity in the direction of the force imposed by the applied field. It is directly proportional to the electric field as follows:
 
𝜐d=𝜇eℰ (18.7)
The constant of proportionality 𝜇e is called the electron mobility and is an indication of the 
frequency of scattering events; its units are square meters per volt-second (m2/V ·s).mobility

where n is the number of free or conducting electrons per unit volume (e.g., per cubic

metals and alloys.) Again, metals have high conductivities because of the large numbers 
of free electrons that have been excited into empty states above the Fermi energy. Thus n has a large value in the conductivity expression, Equation 18.8. At this point it is convenient to discuss conduction in metals in terms of the resistiv-ity, the reciprocal of conductivity; the reason for this switch should become apparent in the ensuing discussion. Because crystalline defects serve as scattering centers for conduction electrons in metals, increasing their number raises the resistivity (or lowers the conductivity). The concentration of these imperfections depends on temperature, composition, and the de-gree of cold work of a metal specimen. In fact, it has been observed experimentally that the total resistivity of a metal is the sum of the contributions from thermal vibrations, impurities, and plastic deformation—that is, the scattering mechanisms act indepen-dently of one another. This may be represented in mathematical form as follows:
 
𝜌total=𝜌t+𝜌i+𝜌d (18.9)
in which 𝜌t, 𝜌i, and 𝜌d represent the individual thermal, impurity, and deformation resistiv-
ity contributions, respectively. Equation 18.9 is sometimes known as Matthiessen’s rule.  
The influence of temperature and impurity content on total resistivity is demonstrated 
in Figure 18.8, a plot of resistivity versus temperature for high-purity copper and several copper–nickel alloys. For all four metals, resistivity increases with increasing tempera-ture. Furthermore, at a specific temperature (for example, −100° C), resistivity for the 
three Cu–Ni alloys is greater than for “pure” copper, and increases with nickel content.
Influence of Temperature
For the pure metal and all the copper–nickel alloys shown in Figure 18.8, the resistivity rises linearly with temperature above about −200°C. Thus,

where 𝜌0 and a are constants for each particular metal. This dependence of the thermal 
resistivity component on temperature is due to the increase with temperature in ther-
mal vibrations and other lattice irregularities (e.g., vacancies), which serve as electron-scattering centers.
Influence of Impurities
For additions of a single impurity that forms a solid solution, the impurity resistivity 𝜌i 
is related to the impurity concentration ci in terms of the atom fraction (at%/100) as 
follows:
 𝜌i=Aci(1−ci)  (18.11)
where A is a composition-independent constant that is a function of both the impurity 
and host metals. The influence of nickel impurity additions on the room-temperature 
resistivity of copper is demonstrated in Figure 18.9, up to 50 wt% Ni; over this composi-tion range nickel is completely soluble in copper (Figure 9.3 a). Again, nickel atoms in 
copper act as scattering centers, and increasing the concentration of nickel in copper results in an enhancement of resistivity. For a two-phase alloy consisting of 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases, a rule-of-mixtures expression may be used to approximate the resistivity as follows:
 
𝜌i=𝜌𝛼V𝛼+𝜌𝛽V𝛽 (18.12)
where the Vs and 𝜌s represent volume fractions and individual resistivities for the re-
spective phases.
Influence of Plastic Deformation
Plastic deformation also raises the electrical resistivity as a result of increased numbers of electron-scattering dislocations. Furthermore, its influence is much weaker than that of increasing temperature or the presence of impurities.Impurity resistivity

Semiconductivity
The electrical conductivity of semiconducting materials is not as high as that of metals; nev-
ertheless, they have some unique electrical characteristics that render them especially useful. The electrical properties of these materials are extremely sensitive to the presence of even minute concentrations of impurities. Intrinsic semiconductors are those in which the electrical 
behavior is based on the electronic structure inherent in the pure material. When the electri-cal characteristics are dictated by impurity atoms, the semiconductor is said to be extrinsic.intrinsic

Intrinsic semiconductors are characterized by the electron band structure shown in Fig ure 
18.4d : at 0 K, a completely filled valence band, separated from an empty conduction band 
by a relatively narrow forbidden band gap, generally less than 2 eV. The two elemental semiconductors are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), having band gap energies of  approximately 1.1 and 0.7 eV, respectively. Both are found in Group IVA of the periodic table 18.10 INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTIONElectrical and other properties of copper render it the most widely used metallic con-ductor. Oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper, having extremely low oxygen and other impurity contents, is produced for many electrical applications. Aluminum, having a conductivity only about one-half that of copper, is also frequently used as an electrical conductor. Silver has a higher conductivity than either copper or aluminum; however, its use is restricted on the basis of cost. On occasion, it is necessary to improve the mechanical strength of a metal alloy without impairing significantly its electrical conductivity. Both solid-solution alloying (Section 7.9) and cold working (Section 7.10) improve strength at the expense of conductivity; thus, a trade-off must be made for these two properties. Most often, strength is enhanced by intro-ducing a second phase that does not have so adverse an effect on conductivity. For example, copper–beryllium alloys are precipitation hardened (Section 11.10); even so, the conductivity is reduced by about a factor of 5 over that of high-purity copper. For some applications, such as furnace heating elements, a high electrical resistivity is desirable. The energy loss by electrons that are scattered is dissipated as heat energy. Such materials must have not only a high resistivity, but also a resistance to oxidation at elevated temperatures and, of course, a high melting temperature. Nichrome, a nickel–chromium alloy, is commonly employed in heating elements.18.9 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMERCIAL ALLOYS

3The valence bands in silicon and germanium correspond to sp3 hybrid energy levels for the isolated atom; these 
hybridized valence bands are completely filled at 0 K.
4Holes (in addition to free electrons) are created in semiconductors and insulators when electron transitions occur 
from filled states in the valence band to empty states in the conduction band (Figure 18.6). In metals, electron 
transitions normally occur from filled to empty states within the same band (Figure 18.5), without the creation of holes.(Figure 2.8) and are covalently bonded.3 In addition, a host of compound semiconducting 
materials also display intrinsic behavior. One such group is formed between elements of 
Groups IIIA and VA, for example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium antimonide (InSb); these are frequently called III–V compounds. The compounds composed of elements of Groups IIB and VIA also display semiconducting behavior; these include cadmium sulfide (CdS) and zinc telluride (ZnTe). As the two elements forming these compounds become more widely separated with respect to their relative positions in the periodic table (i.e., the electronegativities become more dissimilar, Figure 2.9), the atomic bonding becomes more ionic and the magnitude of the band gap energy increases—the  materials tend to become 
more insulative. Table 18.2 gives the band gaps for some compound semiconductors. Band Gap Electron Mobility Hole Mobility  Electrical Conductivity

thought of as moving by the motion of other valence electrons that repeatedly fill in the 
incomplete bond (Figure 18.10). This process is expedited by treating a missing electron from the valence band as a positively charged particle called a hole. A hole is considered to have a charge that is of the same magnitude as that for an electron, but of opposite sign (+1.6 × 10
−19 C). Thus, in the presence of an electric field, excited electrons and 
holes move in opposite directions. Furthermore, in semiconductors both electrons and holes are scattered by lattice imperfections.
Intrinsic Conductivity
Because there are two types of charge carrier (free electrons and holes) in an intrinsic semiconductor, the expression for electrical conduction, Equation 18.8, must be modified to include a term to account for the contribution of the hole current. Therefore, we write
 
𝜎=n|e|𝜇e+p|e|𝜇h (18.13)
where p is the number of holes per cubic meter and 𝜇h is the hole mobility. The magni-
tude of 𝜇h is always less than 𝜇e for semiconductors. For intrinsic semiconductors, every 
electron promoted across the band gap leaves behind a hole in the valence band; thus,
 n=p=ni (18.14)
where ni is known as the intrinsic carrier concentration. Furthermore,
 𝜎 =n|e|(𝜇e+𝜇h)=p|e|(𝜇e+𝜇h) (18.15)
  =ni|e|(𝜇e+𝜇h)

Virtually all commercial semiconductors are extrinsic —that is, the electrical behavior is 
determined by impurities that, when present in even minute concentrations, introduce 
excess electrons or holes. For example, an impurity concentration of 1 atom in 1012 is 
sufficient to render silicon extrinsic at room temperature.
n-Type Extrinsic Semiconduction
To illustrate how extrinsic semiconduction is accomplished, consider again the elemen-tal semiconductor silicon. An Si atom has four electrons, each of which is covalently bonded with one of four adjacent Si atoms. Now, suppose that an impurity atom with a valence of 5 is added as a substitutional impurity; possibilities would include atoms from the Group VA column of the periodic table (i.e., P, As, and Sb). Only four of five valence electrons of these impurity atoms can participate in the bonding because there are only four possible bonds with neighboring atoms. The extra nonbonding electron is loosely bound to the region around the impurity atom by a weak electrostatic attraction, as illustrated in Figure 18.11a. The binding energy of this electron is relatively small (on the order of 0.01 eV); thus, it is easily removed from the impurity atom, in which case it becomes a free or conducting electron (Figures 18.11b and 18.11c). The energy state of such an electron may be viewed from the perspective of the electron band model scheme. For each of the loosely bound electrons, there exists a single energy level, or energy state, which is located within the forbidden band gap just below the bottom of the conduction band (Figure 18.12 a). The electron binding energy 
corresponds to the energy required to excite the electron from one of these impurity states to a state within the conduction band. Each excitation event (Figure 18.12 b) 
supplies or donates a single electron to the conduction band; an impurity of this type is aptly termed a donor. Because each donor electron is excited from an impurity level, no corresponding hole is created within the valence band. At room temperature, the thermal energy available is sufficient to excite large numbers of electrons from donor states; in addition, some intrinsic valence–conduction 
band transitions occur, as in Figure 18.6 b, but to a negligible degree. Thus, the number 
of electrons in the conduction band far exceeds the number of holes in the valence 
donor state18.11 EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTION

majority carriers by virtue of their density or concentration; holes, on the other hand, are the minority charge carriers.

p-Type Extrinsic Semiconduction
An opposite effect is produced by the addition to silicon or germanium of trivalent substi-
tutional impurities such as aluminum, boron, and gallium from Group IIIA of the periodic table. One of the covalent bonds around each of these atoms is deficient in an electron; such a deficiency may be viewed as a hole that is weakly bound to the impurity atom. This hole may be liberated from the impurity atom by the transfer of an electron from an ad-jacent bond, as illustrated in Figure 18.13. In essence, the electron and the hole exchange positions. A moving hole is considered to be in an excited state and participates in the con-duction process, in a manner analogous to an excited donor electron, as described earlier. Extrinsic excitations, in which holes are generated, may also be represented using the band model. Each impurity atom of this type introduces an energy level within the band gap, above yet very close to the top of the valence band (Figure 18.14 a). A hole is 
imagined to be created in the valence band by the thermal excitation of an electron from the valence band into this impurity electron state, as demonstrated in Figure 18.14 b. 
With such a transition, only one carrier is produced—a hole in the valence band; a free electron is not created in either the impurity level or the conduction band. An impurity of this type is called an acceptor because it is capable of accepting an electron from the valence band, leaving behind a hole. It follows that the energy level within the band gap introduced by this type of impurity is called an acceptor state.

18.12 The Temperature Dependence of Carrier Concentration   •  665
 For this type of extrinsic conduction, holes are present in much higher concentra-
tions than electrons (i.e., p >> n), and under these circumstances a material is termed 
p-type because positively charged particles are primarily responsible for electrical con-duction. Of course, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons are present in minority concentrations. This gives rise to a predominance of the second term on the right-hand side of Equation 18.13, or
 
𝜎 ≅ p|e|𝜇h (18.17)
For p-type semiconductors, the Fermi level is positioned within the band gap and near 
to the acceptor level.
 Extrinsic semiconductors (both n- and p-type) are produced from materials that are initially of extremely high purity, commonly having total impurity contents on the order of 10
−7 at%. Controlled concentrations of specific donors or acceptors are then 
intentionally added, using various techniques. Such an alloying process in semiconduct-ing materials is termed doping.
 In extrinsic semiconductors, large numbers of charge carriers (either electrons or 
holes, depending on the impurity type) are created at room temperature by the available thermal energy. As a consequence, relatively high room-temperature electrical conduc-tivities are obtained in extrinsic semiconductors. Most of these materials are designed for use in electronic devices to be operated at ambient conditions.For a p-type

Figure 18.15 plots the logarithm of the intrinsic carrier concentration ni versus tempera-
ture for both silicon and germanium. A couple of features of this plot are worth noting. 
First, the concentrations of electrons and holes increase with temperature because, with rising temperature, more thermal energy is available to excite electrons from the va-lence to the conduction band (per Figure 18.6b). In addition, at all temperatures, carrier concentration in Ge is greater than in Si. This effect is due to germanium’s smaller band gap (0.67 vs. 1.11 eV, Table 18.2); thus, for Ge, at any given temperature, more electrons will be excited across its band gap. However, the carrier concentration–temperature behavior for an extrinsic semiconduc-
tor is much different. For example, electron concentration versus temperature for silicon that has been doped with 10

5Note that the shapes of the Si curve of Figure 18.15 and the ni curve of Figure 18.16 are not the same, even though 
identical parameters are plotted in both cases. This disparity is due to the scaling of the plot axes: Temperature (i.e., 
horizontal) axes for both plots are scaled linearly; however, the carrier concentration axis of Figure 18.15 is logarithmic, whereas this same axis of Figure 18.16 is linear.

curve are three regions. At intermediate temperatures (between approximately 150 K and 
475 K) the material is n -type (inasmuch as P is a donor impurity), and electron concentration 
is constant; this is termed the extrinsic-temperature region .6 Electrons in the conduction band 
are excited from the phosphorus donor state (per Figure 18.12b ), and because the electron 
concentration is approximately equal to the P content (1021 m−3), virtually all of the phospho-
rus atoms have been ionized (i.e., have donated electrons). Also, intrinsic excitations across the band gap are insignificant in relation to these extrinsic donor excitations. The range of temperatures over which this extrinsic region exists depends on impurity concentration; fur-thermore, most solid-state devices are designed to operate within this temperature range. At low temperatures, below about 100 K (Figure 18.16), electron concentration drops dramatically with decreasing temperature and approaches zero at 0 K. Over these temperatures, the thermal energy is insufficient to excite electrons from the P donor level into the conduction band. This is termed the freeze-out temperature region inas-
much as charged carriers (i.e., electrons) are “frozen” to the dopant atoms. Finally, at the high end of the temperature scale of Figure 18.16, electron concentra-tion increases above the P content and asymptotically approaches the intrinsic curve as temperature increases. This is termed the intrinsic temperature region  because at these 
high temperatures the semiconductor becomes intrinsic—that is, charge carrier concen-trations resulting from electron excitations across the band gap first become equal to and then completely overwhelm the donor carrier contribution with rising temperature.
6For donor-doped semiconductors, this region is sometimes called the saturation region; for acceptor-doped materials, 
it is often termed the exhaustion region.

The conductivity (or resistivity) of a semiconducting material, in addition to being 
dependent on electron and/or hole concentrations, is also a function of the charge car-riers’ mobilities (Equation 18.13)—that is, the ease with which electrons and holes are transported through the crystal. Furthermore, magnitudes of electron and hole mobilities are influenced by the presence of those same crystalline defects that are responsible for the scattering of electrons in metals: thermal vibrations (i.e., temperature) and impurity atoms. We now explore the manner in which dopant impurity content and temperature influence the mobilities of both electrons and holes.
Influence of Dopant Content
Figure 18.17 represents the room-temperature dependence of electron and hole mobilities in silicon as a function of the dopant (both acceptor and donor) content; note that both axes on this plot are scaled logarithmically. At dopant concentrations less than about 10
20 m−3, both carrier mobilities are at their maximum levels and independent of the 
doping concentration. In addition, both mobilities decrease with increasing impurity content. Also worth noting is that the mobility of electrons is always larger than the 
mobility of holes.
Influence of Temperature
The temperature dependences of electron and hole mobilities for silicon are presented in Figures 18.18a  and 18.18b , respectively. Curves for several impurity dopant contents are 
shown for both carrier types; note that both sets of axes are scaled logarithmically. From these plots, note that, for dopant concentrations of 10

hole mobilities decrease in magnitude with rising temperature; again, this effect is due to 
 enhanced thermal scattering of the carriers. For both electrons and holes and dopant 
 levels less than 1020 m−3, the dependence of mobility on temperature is independent of 
acceptor/donor concentration (i.e., is represented by a single curve). Also, for concentra-tions greater than 10
20 m−3, curves in both plots are shifted to progressively lower mobility 
values with increasing dopant level. These latter two effects are consistent with the data presented in Figure 18.17.
 These previous treatments discussed the influence of temperature and dopant con-
tent on both carrier concentration and carrier mobility. Once values of n , p, 𝜇
e, and 
𝜇h have been determined for a specific donor/acceptor concentration and at a specified 
temperature (using Figures 18.15 through 18.18), computation of 𝜎 is possible using 
Equation 18.15, 18.16, or 18.17.

tivity versus temperature for silicon that has been doped with 10

Electrical Conductivity Determination for Intrinsic Silicon at 150°C
Calculate the electrical conductivity of intrinsic silicon at 150 °C (423 K).
Solution
This problem may be solved using Equation 18.15, which requires specification of values for ni, 𝜇e, 
and 𝜇h. From Figure 18.15, ni for Si at 423 K is 4 ×  1019 m−3. Furthermore, intrinsic electron and 
hole mobilities are taken from the <1020 m−3 curves of Figures 18.18a  and 18.18b , respectively; at 
423 K, 𝜇e = 0.06 m2/V·s and 𝜇h = 0.022 m2/V·s (realizing that both mobility and temperature axes 
are scaled logarithmically). Finally, from Equation 18.15, the conductivity is given by

Room-Temperature and Elevated-Temperature Electrical 
Conductivity Calculations for Extrinsic Silicon
To high-purity silicon is added 1023 m−3 arsenic atoms.
(a) Is this material n-type or p-type?
(b) Calculate the room-temperature electrical conductivity of this material.(c) Compute the conductivity at 100°C (373 K).
Solution
(a) Arsenic is a Group VA element (Figure 2.8) and, therefore, acts as a donor in silicon, which 
means that this material is n-type.
(b) At room temperature (298 K), we are within the extrinsic temperature region of Fig-
ure 18.16, which means that virtually all of the arsenic atoms have donated electrons (i.e., 
n = 10
23 m−3). Furthermore, inasmuch as this material is extrinsic n-type, conductivity 
may be computed using Equation 18.16. Consequently, it is necessary to determine the 
electron mobility for a donor concentration of 1023 m−3. We can do this using Figure 
18.17: At 1023 m−3, 𝜇e=0.07 m2/V ·s (remember that both axes of Figure 18.17 are scaled 
logarithmically). Thus, the conductivity is just
 𝜎=n|e|𝜇e
 =(1023 m−3)(1.6 ×10−19 C)(0.07 m2∕V·s)
 =1120 ( Ω· m)−1
(c) To solve for the conductivity of this material at 373 K, we again use Equation 18.16 with 
the electron mobility at this temperature. From the 1023 m−3 curve of Figure 18.18 a, at 373 K, 
𝜇e = 0.04 m2/V ·s, which leads to

DESIGN EXAMPLE 18.1
Acceptor Impurity Doping in Silicon
An extrinsic p -type silicon material is desired having a room-temperature conductivity of 
50 (Ω · m)−1. Specify an acceptor impurity type that may be used, as well as its concentration 
in atom percent, to yield these electrical characteristics.
Solution
First, the elements that, when added to silicon, render it p-type lie one group to the left of 
silicon in the periodic table. These include the Group IIIA elements (Figure 2.8): boron, 
aluminum, gallium, and indium. Because this material is extrinsic and p -type (i.e., p  >> n), the electrical conductiv-
ity is a function of both hole concentration and hole mobility according to Equation 18.17. 
In addition, it is assumed that at room temperature, all the acceptor dopant atoms have accepted electrons to form holes (i.e., that we are in the extrinsic region of Figure 18.16), which is to say that the number of holes is approximately equal to the number of acceptor impurities N
a.
 This problem is complicated by the fact that 𝜇h is dependent on impurity content per 
Figure 18.17. Consequently, one approach to solving this problem is trial and error: Assume an impurity concentration, and then compute the conductivity using this value and the corre-sponding hole mobility from its curve of Figure 18.17. Then, on the basis of this result, repeat the process, assuming another impurity concentration. For example, let us select an N
a value (i.e., a p  value) of 1022 m−3. At this concentra-
tion, the hole mobility is approximately 0.04 m2/V ·s (Figure 18.17); these values yield a 
conductivity of
 𝜎=p|e|𝜇h=(1022 m−3)(1.6 ×10−19 C)(0.04 m2∕V·s)
 =64 (Ω·m)−1
which is a little on the high side. Decreasing the impurity content an order of magnitude to 10
21 m−3 results in only a slight increase of 𝜇h to about 0.045 m2/V ·s (Figure 18.17); thus, the 
resulting conductivity is
 𝜎=(1021 m−3)(1.6 ×10−19 C)(0.045 m2/V ·s)
 =7.2 ( Ω·m)−1
With some fine tuning of these numbers, a conductivity of 50 ( Ω·m)−1 is achieved when 
Na=p ≅ 8×1021 m−3; at this Na value, 𝜇h remains approximately 0.04 m2/V ·s.
 It next becomes necessary to calculate the concentration of acceptor impurity in atom percent. This computation first requires the determination of the number of silicon atoms per cubic meter, N
Si, using Equation 4.2, which is given as follows:

18.14 The Hall Effect  •   671
For some materials, it is on occasion desired to determine the material’s majority charge 
carrier type, concentration, and mobility. Such determinations are not possible from a simple electrical conductivity measurement; a Hall effect experiment must also be conducted. This 
Hall effect is a result of the phenomenon by which a magnetic field applied perpendicular to 
the direction of motion of a charged particle exerts a force (called the Lorentz force) on the particle perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the particle motion directions. Let us first consider materials for which the electrical conduction arises from the mo-tion of electrons (i.e., most metals and n -type semiconductors, for which n  >>  p ). Consider 
the parallelepiped specimen shown in Figure 18.19a  that is referenced to an x-y-z Cartesian 
coordinate system. An external voltage (V
x), is applied so as to give rise to a current (Ix) 
that flows in the + x direction as shown; electron motion is in the −x direction, as noted by 
the dashed arrow. Upon the imposition of a magnetic field in the +z direction (denoted as 
Bz), a force, the Lorentz force, F (−y) is brought to bear on an electron in the − y direction 
such that it (the electron) assumes a curved trajectory toward the left (back) face of the specimen, as also noted in Figure 18.19a . Electrons continue to pile up on this specimen 
face, while at the same time the opposite (front) specimen face assumes a net positive 
charge as a result of the depletion of electrons from this region—a condition repre-sented in Figure 18.19b . This situation leads to the creation of a voltage (V
H) between 
these charged specimen faces, and, in addition, to another force [F(+y)] imposed on the electrons part icipating in the I
x current, which is in a direction opposite to that of F(−y) 
(Figure 18.19b ). Ultimately, a condition of steady-state is achieved when F (+y) = F (−y) 
and electron motion resumes in the − x direction, as noted by the arrow in Figure 18.19b .
 From the magnitude and sign of the Hall voltage it is possible to determine the type of charger carrier (electron or hole), as well as charge carrier concentration and mobility. For a negative V
H, electrons are the charge carriers. Furthermore, by equating 
expressions for F(+y) and F(− y), it is possible to derive an equation for the magnitude 
of VH, which is as follows:
 VH=RH  Ix Bz
d (18.18)
where d is the specimen thickness (Figure 18.19b). RH in Equation 18.18 is termed the 
Hall coefficient, which is a constant for a specific material. For metals and n-type semi-
conductors, in which conduction is by electrons, RH is negative and is given by

steady-state situation wherein a voltage (Hall voltage, VH)

Thus, n may be determined because RH may be found using Equation 18.18 and the 
magnitude of e, the charge on an electron, is known.
 From Equation 18.8, the electron mobility 𝜇e is just
 𝜇e=𝜎
n|e| (18.20a)
or, using Equation 18.19,
 𝜇e=|RH|𝜎 (18.20b)
Thus, the magnitude of 𝜇e may also be determined if the conductivity 𝜎 has also been 
measured from another independent experiment.
 For p-type semiconductors, conduction arises from the motion of holes—the electrical 
charge on each hole is positive, and hole motion is in the +x direction (opposite to 
that for electrons) as noted in Figure 18.19 c. Consequently, the Lorentz force imposed 
on holes is in the same direction as for electrons—toward the back-specimen face. However, this leads to a positively charged back face and a negatively charged front face—a situation just the reverse of when electrons are charge carriers, as explained previously. Thus, the sign of V
H is positive, which is opposite to that for metals and 
n-type semiconductors.
 A different experimental configuration is necessary for measurements on intrinsic semiconductors and for extrinsic semiconductors having n and p values of comparable 
magnitudes. Furthermore, another set of equations is used to compute values for n and 
p, as well as electron and hole mobilities.For metals, electron

The unique electrical properties of semiconductors permit their use in devices to 
perform specific electronic functions. Diodes and transistors, which have replaced old- fashioned vacuum tubes, are two familiar examples. Advantages of semiconductor 
devices (sometimes termed solid-state devices) include small size, low power consumption, and no warmup time. Vast numbers of extremely small circuits, each consisting of numerous electronic devices, may be incorporated onto a small silicon chip. The invention of semi-conductor devices, which has given rise to miniaturized circuitry, is responsible for the advent and extremely rapid growth of a host of new industries in the past few decades.
The p–n Rectifying Junction
A rectifier, or diode, is an electronic device that allows the current to flow in one direction only; for example, a rectifier transforms an alternating current into direct current. Before the advent of the p–n junction semiconductor rectifier, this operation was carried out us-ing the vacuum tube diode. The p–n rectifying junction is constructed from a single piece 
of semiconductor that is doped so as to be n -type on one side and p -type on the other 
(Figure 18.20a ). If pieces of n - and p -type materials are joined together, a poor rectifier 
results because the presence of a surface between the two sections renders the device very inefficient. Also, single crystals of semiconducting materials must be used in all devices because electronic phenomena deleterious to operation occur at grain boundaries. Before the application of any potential across the p–n specimen, holes are the 
dominant carriers on the p -side, and electrons predominate in the n -region, as illus-
trated in Figure 18.20a . An external electric potential may be established across a p–n  diode

674  •   Chapter 18  /  Electrical Properties
junction with two different polarities. When a battery is used, the positive terminal may 
be connected to the p-side and the negative terminal to the n -side; this is referred to as 
a forward bias. The opposite polarity (minus to p  and plus to n ) is termed reverse bias.
 The response of the charge carriers to the application of a forward-biased potential is demonstrated in Figure 18.20b. The holes on the p-side and the electrons on the n-side are attracted to the junction. As electrons and holes encounter one another near the junction, they continuously recombine and annihilate one another, according to
 electron +hole
→ energy (18.21)
Thus for this bias, large numbers of charge carriers flow across the semiconductor and to 
the junction, as evidenced by an appreciable current and a low resistivity. The current–voltage characteristics for forward bias are shown on the right-hand half of Figure 18.21. For reverse bias (Figure 18.20c ), both holes and electrons, as majority carriers, 
are rapidly drawn away from the junction; this separation of positive and negative charges (or polarization) leaves the junction region relatively free of mobile charge carriers. Recombination does not occur to any appreciable extent, so that the junc-tion is now highly insulative. Figure 18.21 also illustrates the current–voltage behavior for reverse bias. The rectification process in terms of input voltage and output current is demon-strated in Figure 18.22. Whereas voltage varies sinusoidally with time (Figure 18.22 a),

IR and the imposed maximum voltage ( ±V0) is noted in Figure 18.21.
 At high reverse bias voltages—sometimes on the order of several hundred volts—
large numbers of charge carriers (electrons and holes) are generated. This gives rise to a very abrupt increase in current, a phenomenon known as breakdown, also shown in Figure 18.21; this is discussed in more detail in Section 18.22.
The Transistor
Transistors, which are extremely important semiconducting devices in today’s microelec-tronic circuitry, are capable of two primary types of function. First, they can perform the same operation as their vacuum-tube precursor, the triode—that is, they can amplify an electrical signal. In addition, they serve as switching devices in computers for the processing and storage of information. The two major types are the junction (or bimodal) transistor  
and the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (abbreviated as MOSFET).
Junction Transistors
 The junction transistor is composed of two p–n junctions arranged back to back in  either the n–p–n or the p–n–p configuration; the latter variety is discussed here. Figure 18.23 
is a schematic representation of a p–n–p junction transistor along with its attendant circuitry. A very thin n -type base region is sandwiched between p -type emitter and collector regions. 
The circuit that includes the emitter–base junction (junction 1) is forward biased, whereas a reverse bias voltage is applied across the base–collector junction (junction 2). Figure 18.24 illustrates the mechanics of operation in terms of the motion of charge carriers. Because the emitter is p -type and junction 1 is forward biased, large numbers of 
holes enter the base region. These injected holes are minority carriers in the n-type base, junction transistor

and some combine with the majority electrons. However, if the base is extremely narrow 
and the semiconducting materials have been properly prepared, most of these holes will be swept through the base without recombination, then across junction 2 and into the p-type collector. The holes now become a part of the emitter–collector circuit. A small 
increase in input voltage within the emitter–base circuit produces a large increase in cur-rent across junction 2. This large increase in collector current is also reflected by a large in-crease in voltage across the load resistor, which is also shown in the circuit (Figure 18.23). Thus, a voltage signal that passes through a junction transistor experiences amplification; this effect is also illustrated in Figure 18.23 by the two voltage–time plots. Similar reasoning applies to the operation of an n–p–n transistor, except that elec-trons instead of holes are injected across the base and into the collector.
The MOSFET
 One variety of MOSFET7 consists of two small islands of p-type semiconductor that 
are created within a substrate of n -type silicon, as shown in cross section in Figure 18.25; 
the islands are joined by a narrow p -type channel. Appropriate metal connections (source 
and drain) are made to these islands; an insulating layer of silicon dioxide is formed by the surface oxidation of the silicon. A final connector (gate) is then fashioned onto the surface of this insulating layer. The conductivity of the channel is varied by the presence of an electric field im-posed on the gate. For example, imposition of a positive field on the gate drives charge carriers (in this case holes) out of the channel, thereby reducing the electrical conductiv-ity. Thus, a small alteration in the field at the gate produces a relatively large variation in current between the source and the drain. In some respects, then, the operation of a MOSFET is very similar to that described for the junction transistor. The primary dif-ference is that the gate current is exceedingly small in comparison to the base current Figure 18.25  Schematic cross-sectional view of a MOSFET 
transistor.Source Gate Drain

of a junction transistor. Therefore, MOSFETs are used where the signal sources to be 
amplified cannot sustain an appreciable current. Another important difference between MOSFETs and junction transistors is that although majority carriers dominate in the functioning of MOSFETs (i.e., holes for the depletion-mode p-type MOSFET of Figure 18.25), minority carriers do play a role with 
junction transistors (i.e., injected holes in the n-type base region, Figure 18.24).

Semiconductors in Computers
 In addition to their ability to amplify an imposed electrical signal, transistors and diodes may also act as switching devices, a feature used for arithmetic and logical operations, and also for information storage in computers. Computer numbers and functions are expressed in terms of a binary code (i.e., numbers written to the base 2). Within this framework, numbers are represented by a series of two states (sometimes designated 0 and 1). Now, transistors and diodes within a digital circuit operate as switches that also have two states—on and off, or conducting and nonconducting; “off” corresponds to one binary number state and “on” to the other. Thus, a single number may be represented by a collection of circuit elements containing transistors that are appropriately switched.
Flash (Solid-State Drive) Memory
 A relatively new and rapidly evolving information storage technology that uses  semiconductor devices is flash memory. Flash memory is programmed and erased elec-tronically, as described in the preceding paragraph. Furthermore, this flash technology is nonvolatile —that is, no electrical power is needed to retain the stored information. There 
are no moving parts (as with magnetic hard drives and magnetic tapes, Section 20.11), which makes flash memory especially attractive for general storage and transfer of data between portable devices, such as digital cameras, laptop computers, mobile phones, digital audio players, and game consoles. In addition, flash technology is packaged as memory cards [see chapter-opening figures (b ) and (c )], solid-state drives, and USB flash 
drives. Unlike magnetic memory, flash packages are extremely durable and are capable of withstanding relatively wide temperature extremes, as well as immersion in water. Furthermore, over time and the evolution of this flash-memory technology, storage ca-pacity will continue to increase, physical chip size will decrease, and memory price will fall. The mechanism of flash-memory operation is relatively complicated and beyond the scope of this discussion. In essence, information is stored on a chip composed of a very large number of memory cells. Each cell consists of an array of transistors similar to the MOSFETs described earlier in this chapter; the primary difference is that flash-memory transistors have two gates instead of just one as for the MOSFETs (Fig-ure 18.25). Flash memory is a special type of e lectronically erasable, programmable, 
read-o nly memory (EEPROM). Data erasure is very rapid for entire blocks of cells, 
which makes this type of memory ideal for applications requiring frequent updates of large quantities of data (as with the applications noted in the preceding paragraph). Erasure leads to a clearing of cell contents so that it can be rewritten; this occurs by a change in electronic charge at one of the gates, which takes place very rapidly—that is, in a “flash”—hence the name.

Microelectronic Circuitry
During the past few years, the advent of microelectronic circuitry, in which millions of 
electronic components and circuits are incorporated into a very small space, has revolu-tionized the field of electronics. This revolution was precipitated, in part, by aerospace technology, which needed computers and electronic devices that were small and had low power requirements. As a result of refinement in processing and fabrication tech-niques, there has been an astonishing depreciation in the cost of integrated circuitry. Consequently, personal computers have become affordable to large segments of the population in many countries. Also, the use of integrated circuits has become infused 
into many other facets of our lives—calculators, communications, watches, industrial production and control, and all phases of the electronics industry. Inexpensive microelectronic circuits are mass produced by using some very inge-nious fabrication techniques. The process begins with the growth of relatively large cylin-drical single crystals of high-purity silicon from which thin circular wafers are cut. Many microelectronic or integrated circuits, sometimes called chips, are prepared on a single 
wafer. A chip is rectangular, typically on the order of 6 mm ( 
1
4 in.) on a side, and con-
tains millions of circuit elements: diodes, transistors, resistors, and capacitors. Enlarged photographs and elemental maps of a microprocessor chip are presented in Figure 18.26; integrated circuit

Metallic aluminum is an electrical conduc-tor and, as such, wires the circuit elements together. Approximately 200×.
Note: the discussion of Section 4.10 
mentioned that an image is generated on a scanning electron micrograph as a beam of electrons scans the surface of the specimen being examined. The electrons in this beam cause some of the specimen surface atoms to emit x-rays; the energy of an x-ray photon depends on the particular atom from which it radiates. It is possible to selectively filter out all but the x-rays emitted from one kind of atom. When projected on a cathode ray tube, small white dots are produced that indicate the locations of the particular atom type; thus, a dot map of the image is generated.

these micrographs reveal the intricacy of integrated circuits. At this time, microproces-
sor chips with densities approaching 1 billion transistors are being produced, and this number doubles about every 18 months. Microelectronic circuits consist of many layers that lie within or are stacked on top of the silicon wafer in a precisely detailed pattern. Using photolithographic techniques, very small elements for each layer are masked in accordance with a microscopic pattern. Circuit elements are constructed by the selective introduction of specific materials [by diffusion (Section 5.6) or ion implantation] into unmasked regions to create localized n-type, p-type, high-resistivity, or conductive areas. This procedure is repeated layer by 
layer until the total integrated circuit has been fabricated, as illustrated in the MOSFET schematic (Figure 18.25). Elements of integrated circuits are shown in Figure 18.26 and in chapter-opening photograph ( a).
Electrical Conduction in Ionic 
Ceramics and in Polymers
Most polymers and ionic ceramics are insulating materials at room temperature and, 
therefore, have electron energy band structures similar to that represented in Figure 18.4 c; 
a filled valence band is separated from an empty conduction band by a relatively large band gap, usually greater than 2 eV. Thus, at normal temperatures, only very few elec-trons may be excited across the band gap by the available thermal energy, which accounts for the very small values of conductivity; Table 18.3 gives the room-temperature electrical conductivities of several of these materials. (The electrical resistivities of a large number of ceramic and polymeric materials are provided in Table B.9, Appendix B.) Many materi-als are used on the basis of their ability to insulate, and thus a high electrical resistivity is desirable. With rising temperature, insulating materials experience an increase in electri-cal conductivity, which may ultimately be greater than that for semiconductors.

Both cations and anions in ionic materials possess an electric charge and, as a conse-
quence, are capable of migration or diffusion when an electric field is present. Thus, an electric current results from the net movement of these charged ions, which are present in addition to current due to any electron motion. Anion and cation migrations are in opposite directions. The total conductivity of an ionic material 𝜎
total is thus equal to the 
sum of electronic and ionic contributions, as follows:
 𝜎total=𝜎electronic +𝜎ionic  (18.22)
Either contribution may predominate, depending on the material, its purity, and temperature.
 A mobility 𝜇I may be associated with each of the ionic species as follows:
 𝜇I=nIeDI
kT (18.23)
where nI and DI represent, respectively, the valence and diffusion coefficient of a par-
ticular ion; e , k, and T  denote the same parameters as explained earlier in the chapter. 
Thus, the ionic contribution to the total conductivity increases with increasing tem-perature, as does the electronic component. However, in spite of the two conductivity contributions, most ionic materials remain insulative, even at elevated temperatures.For ionic materials,
conductivity is equal to the sum of electronic and ionic contributions
Computation of 
mobility for an ionic species
Most polymeric materials are poor conductors of electricity (Table 18.3) because of 
the unavailability of large numbers of free electrons to participate in the conduction process; electrons in polymers are tightly bound in covalent bonds. The mechanism of electrical conduction in these materials is not well understood, but it is believed that conduction in polymers of high purity is electronic.
Conducting Polymers
Polymeric materials have been synthesized that have electrical conductivities on par with those of metallic conductors; they are appropriately termed conducting polymers. 
Conductivities as high as 1.5 × 10
7 (Ω·m)−1 have been achieved in these materials; on 
a volume basis, this value corresponds to one-fourth of the conductivity of copper, or twice its conductivity on the basis of weight. This phenomenon is observed in a dozen or so polymers, including polyacetylene, polyparaphenylene, polypyrrole, and polyaniline. Each of these polymers contains a sys-tem of alternating single and double bonds and/or aromatic units in the polymer chain. For example, the chain structure of polyacetylene is as follows:18.16 CONDUCTION IN IONIC MATERIALS

The valence electrons associated with the alternating single and double chain-bonds are delocalized, which means they are shared among the backbone atoms in the polymer chain—similar to the way that electrons in a partially filled band for a metal are shared by the ion cores. In addition, the band structure of a conductive polymer is characteristic 
18.18 Capacitance  •   681
of that for an electrical insulator (Figure 18.4 c)—at 0 K, a filled valence band separated 
from an empty conduction band by a forbidden energy band gap. In their pure forms, 
these polymers, which typically have band gap energies greater than 2 eV, are semicon-ductors or insulators. However, they become conductive when doped with appropriate impurities such as AsF
5, SbF5, or iodine. As with semiconductors, conducting polymers 
may be made either n-type (i.e., free-electron dominant) or p-type (i.e., hole dominant), depending on the dopant. However, unlike semiconductors, the dopant atoms or mol-ecules do not substitute for or replace any of the polymer atoms. The mechanism by which large numbers of free electrons and holes are generated in these conducting polymers is complex and not well understood. In very simple terms, it appears that the dopant atoms lead to the formation of new energy bands that over-lap the valence and conduction bands of the intrinsic polymer, giving rise to a partially filled band, and the production at room temperature of a high concentration of free electrons or holes. Orienting the polymer chains, either mechanically (Section 15.7) or magnetically, during synthesis results in a highly anisotropic material having a maximum conductivity along the direction of orientation. These conducting polymers have the potential to be used in a host of applications inasmuch as they have low densities and are flexible. Rechargeable batteries and fuel cells are being manufactured that use polymer electrodes. In many respects, these bat-teries are superior to their metallic counterparts. Other possible applications include wiring in aircraft and aerospace components, antistatic coatings for clothing, electro-magnetic screening materials, and electronic devices (e.g., transistors, diodes). Several conductive polymers display the phenomenon of electroluminescence —that is, light 
emission stimulated by an electrical current. Electroluminescent polymers are being used in applications such as solar panels and flat panel displays (see the Materials of Importance piece on light-emitting diodes in Chapter 21).
Dielectric Behavior
A dielectric material is one that is electrically insulating (nonmetallic) and exhibits or 
may be made to exhibit an electric dipole structure—that is, there is a separation of 
positive and negative electrically charged entities on a molecular or atomic level. This concept of an electric dipole was introduced in Section 2.7. As a result of dipole interac-tions with electric fields, dielectric materials are used in capacitors.dielectric
electric dipole
When a voltage is applied across a capacitor, one plate becomes positively charged and 
the other negatively charged, with the corresponding electric field directed from the positive to the negative plates. The capacitance C is related to the quantity of charge 
stored on either plate Q by
 
C=Q
V (18.24)
where V is the voltage applied across the capacitor. The units of capacitance are cou-
lombs per volt, or farads (F).
 Now, consider a parallel-plate capacitor with a vacuum in the region between the plates (Figure 18.27a). The capacitance may be computed from the relationship

where A represents the area of the plates and l  is the distance between them. The 
parameter 𝜀0, called the permittivity of a vacuum, is a universal constant having the value 
of 8.85 × 10−12 F/m.

𝜀0 (18.27)
which is greater than unity and represents the increase in charge-storing capacity upon 
insertion of the dielectric medium between the plates. The dielectric constant is one material property of prime consideration for capacitor design. The 𝜀

field.
Perhaps the best approach to an explanation of the phenomenon of capacitance is with 
the aid of field vectors. To begin, for every electric dipole, there is a separation between a positive and a negative electric charge, as demonstrated in Figure 18.28. An electric dipole moment p is associated with each dipole as follows:
 
p=qd (18.28)
where q is the magnitude of each dipole charge and d is the distance of separation be-
tween them. A dipole moment is a vector that is directed from the negative to the posi-
tive charge, as indicated in Figure 18.28. In the presence of an electric field ℰ, which is 
also a vector quantity, a force (or torque) comes to bear on an electric dipole to orient it with the applied field; this phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 18.29. The process of dipole alignment is termed polarization.Electric dipole

 Again, to return to the capacitor, the surface charge density D, or quantity of charge 
per unit area of capacitor plate (C/m2), is proportional to the electric field. When a 
vacuum is present, then
 D0=𝜀0ℰ (18.29)
where the constant of proportionality is 𝜀0. Furthermore, an analogous expression exists 
for the dielectric case—that is, 
D=𝜀ℰ (18.30)
Sometimes, D is also called the dielectric displacement.
 The increase in capacitance, or dielectric constant, can be explained using a simpli-
fied model of polarization within a dielectric material. Consider the capacitor in Figure 18.30a —the vacuum situation—where a charge of + Q
0 is stored on the top plate and − Q0 
on the bottom plate. When a dielectric is introduced and an electric field is applied, the entire solid within the plates becomes polarized (Figure 18.30 c). As a result of this 
polarization, there is a net accumulation of negative charge of magnitude −ΔQ at the 
dielectric surface near the positively charged plate and, in a similar manner, a surplus of +ΔQ charge at the surface adjacent to the negative plate. For the region of  dielectric Dielectric

removed from these surfaces, polarization effects are not important. Thus, if each plate 
and its adjacent dielectric surface are considered to be a single entity, the induced charge from the dielectric ( +ΔQ or −Δ Q) may be thought of as nullifying some of the 
charge that originally existed on the plate for a vacuum ( −Q
0 or + Q0). The voltage 
imposed across the plates is maintained at the vacuum value by increasing the charge at the negative (or bottom) plate by an amount −Δ Q and that at the top plate by +Δ Q. 
Electrons are caused to flow from the positive to the negative plate by the external volt-age source such that the proper voltage is reestablished. Thus, the charge on each plate is now Q
0 +ΔQ, having been increased by an amount ΔQ.
 In the presence of a dielectric, the charge density between the plates, which is equal to the surface charge density on the plates of a capacitor, may also be repre-sented by
 
D=𝜀0ℰ+P (18.31)
where P is the polarization, or the increase in charge density above that for a vacuum 
because of the presence of the dielectric; or, from Figure 18.30 c, P = ΔQ∕A, where A is 
the area of each plate. The units of P are the same as for D (C/m2).
 The polarization P may also be thought of as the total dipole moment per unit 
volume of the dielectric material, or as a polarization electric field within the dielectric 
that results from the mutual alignment of the many atomic or molecular dipoles with the externally applied field ℰ. For many dielectric materials, P is proportional to ℰ through 
the relationship
 
P=𝜀0(𝜀r−1)ℰ (18.32)
in which case 𝜀r is independent of the magnitude of the electric field.

Again, polarization is the alignment of permanent or induced atomic or molecular dipole 
moments with an externally applied electric field. There are three types or sources of polarization: electronic, ionic, and orientation. Dielectric materials typically exhibit at least one of these polarization types, depending on the material and the manner of external field application.18.20 TYPES OF POLARIZATION
18.20 Types of Polarization  •   687
Electronic Polarization
Electronic polarization may be induced to one degree or another in all atoms. It results 
from a displacement of the center of the negatively charged electron cloud relative to the positive nucleus of an atom by the electric field (Figure 18.31 a). This polarization 
type is found in all dielectric materials and exists only while an electric field is present.
Ionic Polarization
Ionic polarization occurs only in materials that are ionic. An applied field acts to dis-place cations in one direction and anions in the opposite direction, which gives rise to a net dipole moment. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 18.31 b. The magnitude of 
the dipole moment for each ion pair p
i is equal to the product of the relative displace-
ment di and the charge on each ion, or
 pi=qdi (18.33)
Orientation Polarization
The third type, orientation polarization, is found only in substances that possess perma-nent dipole moments. Polarization results from a rotation of the permanent moments into the direction of the applied field, as represented in Figure 18.31 c. This alignment 
tendency is counteracted by the thermal vibrations of the atoms, such that polarization decreases with increasing temperature. The total polarization P of a substance is equal to the sum of the electronic, ionic, and orientation polarizations (P
e, Pi, and Po, respectively), or
 P=Pe+Pi+Po (18.34)
 It is possible for one or more of these contributions to the total polarization to be either absent or negligible in magnitude relative to the others. For example, ionic polarization does not exist in covalently bonded materials in which no ions are present.electronic

(Figure 18.34).

In many practical situations, the current is alternating (ac)—that is, an applied voltage 
or electric field changes direction with time, as indicated in Figure 18.22 a. Consider a 
 dielectric material that is subject to polarization by an ac electric field. With each direction reversal, the dipoles attempt to reorient with the field, as illustrated in Figure 18.32, in a process requiring some finite time. For each polarization type, some minimum reorienta-tion time exists that depends on the ease with which the particular dipoles are capable of realignment. The relaxation frequency is taken as the reciprocal of this minimum 
 reorientation time. A dipole cannot keep shifting orientation direction when the frequency of the ap-plied electric field exceeds its relaxation frequency and, therefore, it will not make a contribution to the dielectric constant. The dependence of 𝜀
r on the field frequency is 
represented schematically in Figure 18.33 for a dielectric medium that exhibits all three 
types of polariz ation; note that the frequency axis is scaled logarithmically. As indicated 
in Figure 18.33, when a polarization mechanism ceases to function, there is an abrupt drop in the dielectric constant; otherwise, 𝜀
r is virtually frequency independent. Table 18.4 gave 
values of the dielectric constant at 60 Hz and 1 MHz; these provide an indication of this frequency dependence at the low end of the frequency spectrum.relaxation frequency18.21 FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF THE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT

18.24 Ferroelectricity  •   689
 The absorption of electrical energy by a dielectric material that is subjected to an 
alternating electric field is termed dielectric loss. This loss may be important at electric 
field frequencies in the vicinity of the relaxation frequency for each of the operative dipole types for a specific material. A low dielectric loss is desired at the frequency of utilization.
Other Electrical Characteristics of Materials
Two other relatively important and novel electrical characteristics that are found in some materials deserve brief mention—ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity.When very high electric fields are applied across dielectric materials, large numbers of electrons may suddenly be excited to energies within the conduction band. As a result, the current through the dielectric by the motion of these electrons increases dramatically; sometimes localized melting, burning, or vaporization produces irreversible degrada-tion and perhaps even failure of the material. This phenomenon is known as dielectric 
breakdown. The dielectric strength, sometimes called the breakdown strength, represents 
the magnitude of an electric field necessary to produce breakdown. Table 18.4 presents dielectric strengths for several materials.
dielectric strength18.22 DIELECTRIC STRENGTH
A number of ceramics and polymers are used as insulators and/or in capacitors. Many of the ceramics, including glass, porcelain, steatite, and mica, have dielectric constants within the range of 6 to 10 (Table 18.4). These materials also exhibit a high degree of di-mensional stability and mechanical strength. Typical applications include power line and electrical insulation, switch bases, and light receptacles. The titania (TiO
2) and titanate 
ceramics, such as barium titanate (BaTiO3), can be made to have extremely high di-
electric constants, which render them especially useful for some capacitor applications. The magnitude of the dielectric constant for most polymers is less than for ceramics because the latter may exhibit greater dipole moments: 𝜀
r values for polymers generally 
lie between 2 and 5. These materials are commonly used for insulation of wires, cables, motors, generators, and so on and, in addition, for some capacitors.18.23 DIELECTRIC MATERIALS
The group of dielectric materials called ferroelectrics exhibit spontaneous polarization —
that is, polarization in the absence of an electric field. They are the dielectric analogue of ferromagnetic materials, which may display permanent magnetic behavior. There must exist in ferroelectric materials permanent electric dipoles, the origin of which is explained for barium titanate, one of the most common ferroelectrics. The spontaneous polarization is a consequence of the positioning of the Ba
2+, Ti4+, and O2− ions within the unit cell, 
as represented in Figure 18.34. The Ba2+ ions are located at the corners of the unit cell, 
which is of tetragonal symmetry (a cube that has been elongated slightly in one direction). The dipole moment results from the relative displacements of the O
2− and Ti4+ ions from 
their symmetrical positions, as shown in the side view of the unit cell. The O2− ions are 
located near, but slightly below, the centers of each of the six faces, whereas the Ti4+ ion ferroelectric18.24 FERROELECTRICITY
690  •   Chapter 18  /  Electrical Properties
is displaced upward from the unit cell center. Thus, a permanent ionic dipole moment is 
associated with each unit cell (Figure 18.34b ). However, when barium titanate is heated 
above its ferroelectric Curie temperature [120° C (250° F)], the unit cell becomes cubic, 
and all ions assume symmetric positions within the cubic unit cell; the material now has a  perovskite crystal structure (Figure 12.6), and the ferroelectric behavior ceases. Spontaneous polarization of this group of materials results as a consequence of inter-actions between adjacent permanent dipoles in which they mutually align, all in the same  direction. For example, with barium titanate, the relative displacements of O
2− and Ti4+ ions 
are in the same direction for all the unit cells within some volume region of the specimen. Other materials display ferroelectricity; these include Rochelle salt (NaKC
4H4O6.4H2O), 
 potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), potassium niobate (KNbO3), and lead 
 zirconate–titanate (Pb[ZrO3, TiO3]). Ferroelectrics have extremely high dielectric constants 
at relatively low applied field frequencies; for example, at room temperature, 𝜀r for barium 
titanate may be as high as 5000. Consequently, capacitors made from these materials can be significantly smaller than capacitors made from other dielectric materials.Figure 18.34  A

An unusual phenomenon exhibited by a few ceramic materials (as well as some 
 polymers) is piezoelectricity —literally, pressure electricity. Electric polarization (i.e., 
an electric field or voltage) is induced in the piezoelectric crystal as a result of a me-chanical strain (dimensional change) produced from the application of an external force (Figure 18.35). Reversing the sign of the force (e.g., from tension to compression) reverses the direction of the field. The inverse piezoelectric effect is also displayed by this group of materials—that is, a mechanical strain results from the imposition of an electrical field. Piezoelectric materials may be used as transducers between electrical and mechanical 
energies. One of the early uses of piezoelectric ceramics was in sonar systems, in which underwater objects (e.g., submarines) are detected and their positions determined using an ultrasonic emitting and receiving system. A piezoelectric crystal is caused to oscillate

by an electrical signal, which produces high-frequency mechanical vibrations that are 
transmitted through the water. Upon encountering an object, the signals are reflected, and another piezoelectric material receives this reflected vibrational energy, which it then converts back into an electrical signal. Distance from the ultrasonic source and reflecting body is determined from the elapsed time between sending and receiving events. More recently, the use of piezoelectric devices has grown dramatically as a con-sequence of increases in automation and consumer attraction to modern sophisticated gadgets. Piezoelectric devices are used in many of today’s applications, including  automotive—wheel balances, seat-belt buzzers, tread-wear indicators, keyless door entry, and airbag sensors; computer/electronic—microphones, speakers, microactua-tors for hard disks and notebook transformers; commercial/consumer—ink-jet printing heads, strain gauges, ultrasonic welders, and smoke detectors; medical—insulin pumps, ultrasonic therapy, and ultrasonic cataract-removal devices. Piezoelectric ceramic materials include titanates of barium and lead (BaTiO
3 and 
PbTiO3), lead zirconate (PbZrO3), lead zirconate–titanate (PZT) [Pb(Zr,Ti)O3], and 
potassium niobate (KNbO3). This property is characteristic of materials having compli-
cated crystal structures with a low degree of symmetry. The piezoelectric behavior of a polycrystalline specimen may be improved by heating above its Curie temperature and then cooling to room temperature in a strong electric field.Figure 18.35  (a) Dipoles within a piezoelectric material.

Piezoelectric Ceramic Ink-Jet Printer HeadsMATERIAL OF IMPORTANCE 18.1
Piezoelectric materials are used in one kind of ink-
jet printer head that has components and a mode 
of operation represented in the schematic diagrams in Figure 18.36a through 18.36c. One head component is a flexible, bilayer disk that consists of a piezoelectric ceramic (orange region) bonded to a nonpiezoelec-tric deformable material (green region); liquid ink and its reservoir are represented by blue  areas in these diagrams. Short, horizontal arrows within the piezoelectric note the direction of the permanent dipole moment.
Printer head operation (i.e., ejection of ink drop-
lets from the nozzle) is a result of the inverse piezo-electric effect—that is, the bilayer disk is caused to flex 
692  •   Chapter 18  /  Electrical Properties
back and forth by the expansion and contraction of the 
piezoelectric layer in response to changes in bias of an applied voltage. For example, Figure 18.36 a shows how 
the imposition of forward bias voltage causes the bi-layer disk to flex in such a way as to pull (or draw) ink from the reservoir into the nozzle chamber. Reversing the voltage bias forces the bilayer disk to bend in the opposite direction—toward the nozzle—so as to eject a drop of ink (Figure 18.36b ). Finally, removal of the 
voltage causes the disk to return to its unbent configu-ration (Figure 18.36c ) in preparation for another ejec-
tion sequence.

SUMMARY
• The ease with which a material is capable of transmitting an electric current is 
expressed in terms of electrical conductivity or its reciprocal, electrical resistivity 
(Equations 18.2 and 18.4).
• The relationship between applied voltage, current, and resistance is Ohm’s law 
(Equation 18.1). An equivalent expression, Equation 18.5, relates current density, con-ductivity, and electric field intensity.
• On the basis of its conductivity, a solid material may be classified as a metal, a semi-
conductor, or an insulator.
• For most materials, an electric current results from the motion of free electrons, 
which are accelerated in response to an applied electric field.
• In ionic materials, there may also be a net motion of ions, which also makes a contri-
bution to the conduction process.Ohm’s Law

Summary  •   693
• The number of free electrons depends on the electron energy band structure of the 
material.
• An electron band is a series of electron states that are closely spaced with respect to en-
ergy, and one such band may exist for each electron subshell found in the isolated atom.
• Electron energy band structure refers to the manner in which the outermost bands are 
arranged relative to one another and then filled with electrons.
For metals, two band structure types are possible (Figures 18.4 a and 18.4b)—
empty electron states are adjacent to filled ones.
Band structures for semiconductors and insulators are similar—both have a forbidden 
energy band gap that, at 0 K, lies between a filled valence band and an empty con-duction band. The magnitude of this band gap is relatively wide ( >2 eV) for insula-
tors (Figure 18.4c ) and relatively narrow (< 2 eV) for semiconductors (Figure 18.4d ).
• An electron becomes free by being excited from a filled state to an available empty 
state at a higher energy.
Relatively small energies are required for electron excitations in metals (Figure 18.5), 
giving rise to large numbers of free electrons.
Greater energies are required for electron excitations in semiconductors and 
insulators (Figure 18.6), which accounts for their lower free electron concentra-tions and smaller conductivity values.
• Free electrons being acted on by an electric field are scattered by imperfections in 
the crystal lattice. The magnitude of electron mobility is indicative of the frequency of these scattering events.
• In many materials, the electrical conductivity is proportional to the product of the 
electron concentration and the mobility (per Equation 18.8).
• For metallic materials, electrical resistivity increases with temperature, impurity 
content, and plastic deformation. The contribution of each to the total resistivity is additive—per Matthiessen’s rule, Equation 18.9.
• Thermal and impurity contributions (for both solid solutions and two-phase alloys) 
are described by Equations 18.10, 18.11, and 18.12.
• Semiconductors may be either elements (Si and Ge) or covalently bonded compounds.
• With these materials, in addition to free electrons, holes (missing electrons in the 
valence band) may also participate in the conduction process (Figure 18.10).
• Semiconductors are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic.
For intrinsic behavior, the electrical properties are inherent in the pure material, 
and electron and hole concentrations are equal. The electrical conductivity 
may be computed using Equation 18.13 (or Equation 18.15).
Electrical behavior is dictated by impurities for extrinsic semiconductors. 
Extrinsic semiconductors may be either n- or p-type depending on whether 
electrons or holes, respectively, are the predominant charge carriers.
• Donor impurities introduce excess electrons (Figures 18.11 and 18.12); acceptor im-
purities introduce excess holes (Figures 18.13 and 18.14).
• The electrical conductivity on an n-type semiconductor may be calculated using 
Equation 18.16; for a p-type semiconductor, Equation 18.17 is used.
• With rising temperature, intrinsic carrier concentration increases dramatically 
(Figure 18.15).
• For extrinsic semiconductors, on a plot of majority carrier concentration versus tem-
perature, carrier concentration is independent of temperature in the extrinsic region Energy Band

(Figure 18.16). The magnitude of carrier concentration in this region is approximately 
equal to the impurity level.
• For extrinsic semiconductors, electron and hole mobilities (1) decrease as impurity 
content increases (Figure 18.17) and (2) in general, decrease with rising temperature (Figures 18.18a and 18.18b).
• Using a Hall effect experiment, it is possible to determine the charge carrier type (i.e., 
electron or hole), as well as carrier concentration and mobility.
• A number of semiconducting devices employ the unique electrical characteristics of 
these materials to perform specific electronic functions.
• The p–n rectifying junction (Figure 18.20) is used to transform alternating current 
into direct current.
• Another type of semiconductor device is the transistor, which may be used for ampli-
fication of electrical signals, as well as for switching devices in computer circuitries. Junction and MOSFET transistors (Figures 18.23, 18.24, and 18.25) are possible.
• Most ionic ceramics and polymers are insulators at room temperature. Electrical con-
ductivities range between about 10
−9 and 10−18 (Ω·m)−1; by way of comparison, for 
most metals, 𝜎 is on the order of 107 (Ω·m)−1.
• A dipole is said to exist when there is a net spatial separation of positively and nega-
tively charged entities on an atomic or molecular level.
• Polarization is the alignment of electric dipoles with an electric field.
• Dielectric materials are electrical insulators that may be polarized when an electric field is present.
• This polarization phenomenon accounts for the ability of the dielectrics to increase 
the charge-storing capability of capacitors.
• Capacitance is dependent on applied voltage and quantity of charge stored according 
to Equation 18.24.
• The charge-storing efficiency of a capacitor is expressed in terms of a dielectric con-
stant or relative permittivity (Equation 18.27).
• For a parallel-plate capacitor, capacitance is a function of the permittivity of the 
material between the plates, as well as plate area and plate separation distance per Equation 18.26.
• The dielectric displacement within a dielectric medium depends on the applied elec-
tric field and the induced polarization according to Equation 18.31.
• For some dielectric materials, the polarization induced by an applied electric field is 
described by Equation 18.32.
• Possible polarization types include electronic (Figure 18.31 a), ionic (Figure 18.31b), 
and orientation (Figure 18.31c); not all types need be present in a particular dielectric.
• For alternating electric fields, whether a specific polarization type contributes to the 
total polarization and dielectric constant depends on frequency; each polarization mechanism ceases to function when the applied field frequency exceeds its relaxation frequency (Figure 18.33).
• Ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous polarization—that is, they polarize in the 
absence of an electric field.
• An electric field is generated when mechanical stresses are applied to a piezoelectric 
material.The Hall Effect

698  •   Chapter  19  Thermal Properties
O ne type of thermostat—a device used to regulate temperature—uses the 
phenomenon of thermal expansion: the elongation of a material as it is heated.1 
The heart of this type of thermostat is a bimetallic strip: Strips of two metals  having 
 different coefficients of thermal expansion are bonded along their lengths. A change in temperature causes this strip to bend; upon heating, the metal having the greater expansion coefficient elongates more, producing the direction of bending shown in Figure (a). In the thermostat shown in Figure (b), the bimetallic strip is a coil or spiral; this configuration provides for a relatively long bimetallic strip, more deflec-tion for a given temperature change, and greater accuracy. The metal having the 
higher expansion coefficient is located on the underside of the strip, such that, upon 
heating, the coil tends to unwind. Attached to the end of the coil is a mercury 
switch—a small glass bulb that contains several drops of mercury [Figure (b)]. This switch is mounted such that, when the tem-perature changes, deflections of the coil end tip the bulb one way or the other; accordingly, the blob of  mercury rolls from o ne 
end of the bulb to the other. When temperature reaches the setpoint of the thermostat, electrical contact is made as the mercury rolls to one end; this switches on the heating or cooling unit (i.e., furnace or air conditioner). The unit shuts off when a limit  temperature is achieved, and as the bulb tilts in the other direction, the blob of mercury rolls to the other end, and electrical contact is broken.
Figure (d) shows the consequences of unseasonably high temperatures on July 24, 1978, 
near Asbury Park, New Jersey: rail lines buckled [which caused the derailment of a passenger car (background)] as a result of stresses from unanticipated thermal expansion.

also have digital displays.
Of the three primary material types, ceramics are the 
most susceptible to thermal shock—brittle fracture resulting from internal stresses that are established within a ceramic piece as a result of rapid changes in temperature (normally upon cooling). Thermal shock is normally an undesirable event, and the suscepti-bility of a ceramic material to this phenomenon is a function of its thermal and mechanical properties (coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, modulus of elasticity, and fracture strength). From knowledge of the relationships between thermal shock parameters and these properties, it is possible (1) in some cases, to make appropriate alterations of the thermal and/or mechanical characteristics in order to render a ceramic more thermally shock resistant; and (2) for a specific ceramic material, to estimate the maximum allowable temperature change without causing fracture.
WHY STUDY the Thermal Properties of Materials?
Thermal property refers to the response of a material to the application of heat. 
As a solid absorbs energy in the form of heat, its temperature rises and its dimen-sions  increase. The energy may be transported to cooler regions of the specimen if  temperature gradients exist, and ultimately, the specimen may melt. Heat capacity, thermal  expansion, and thermal conductivity are properties that are often critical in the practical use of solids.19.1 INTRODUCTIONLearning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Define heat capacity and specific heat.
2.  Note the primary mechanism by which thermal 
energy is assimilated in solid materials.
3.  Determine the linear coefficient of thermal 
expansion, given the length alteration that 
 accompanies a specified temperature change.
4.  Briefly explain the phenomenon of thermal 
expansion from an atomic perspective using a potential energy–versus–interatomic separation plot.
5. Define thermal conductivity.
6.  Note the two principal mechanisms of heat 
conduction in solids, and compare the relative magnitudes of these contributions for each of metals, ceramics, and polymeric materials.
A solid material, when heated, experiences an increase in temperature, signifying that 
some energy has been absorbed. Heat capacity indicates a material’s ability to absorb 
heat from the external surroundings; it represents the amount of energy required to produce a unit temperature rise. In mathematical terms, the heat capacity C is expressed 
as follows:
 
C=dQ
dT (19.1)
where dQ is the energy required to produce a dT temperature change. Typically, heat 
capacity is specified per mole of material (i.e., J/mol ·K, or cal/mol ·K). Specific heat heat capacity

 (often denoted by a lowercase c) is sometimes used; this represents the heat capacity per 
unit mass and has various units (J/kg ·K, cal/g ·K, Btu/lbm·°F).
 There are two ways in which this property may be measured, according to the environmental conditions accompanying the transfer of heat: One is the heat capacity while maintaining the specimen volume constant, C
𝜐; the other is for constant external 
pressure, which is denoted Cp. The magnitude of Cp is always greater than or equal to
C𝜐; however, any difference is very slight for most solid materials at room temperature 
and below.
Vibrational Heat Capacity
In most solids, the principal mode of thermal energy assimilation is by the increase in vibrational energy of the atoms. Atoms in solid materials are constantly vibrating at very high frequencies and with relatively small amplitudes. Rather than being independent of one another, the vibrations of adjacent atoms are coupled by virtue of atomic bonding. These vibrations are coordinated in such a way that traveling lattice waves are produced, a phenomenon represented in Figure 19.1. These may be thought of as elastic waves or simply sound waves, having short wavelengths and very high frequencies, which propa-gate through the crystal at the velocity of sound. The vibrational thermal energy for a material consists of a series of these elastic waves that have a range of distributions and frequencies. Only certain energy values are allowed (the energy is said to be quantized), and a single quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon. (A phonon is analogous 
to the quantum of electromagnetic radiation, the photon.) On occasion, the vibrational 
waves themselves are termed phonons.
 The thermal scattering of free electrons during electronic conduction (Section 18.7) is by these vibrational waves, and these elastic waves also participate in the transport of energy during thermal conduction (see Section 19.4).

19.2 Heat Capacity  •   701
Temperature Dependence of the Heat Capacity
The variation with temperature of the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity at 
constant volume for many relatively simple crystalline solids is shown in Figure 19.2. The C
𝜐 is zero at 0 K, but it rises rapidly with temperature; this corresponds to an 
increased ability of the lattice waves to enhance their average energy with increas-ing temperature. At low temperatures, the relationship between C
𝜐 and the absolute 
temperature T is
 C𝜐=AT3 (19.2)
where A is a temperature-independent constant. Above what is called the Debye

at a value of approximately 3R , R being the gas constant. Thus, even though the 
total energy of the material is increasing with temperature, the quantity of energy 
required to produce a 1-degree temperature change is constant. The value of 𝜃D is 
less than room temperature for many solid materials, and 25 J/mol ·K is a reasonable 
room-temperature approximation for C𝜐.2 Table 19.1 presents experimental specific 
heats for a number of materials; cp values for still more materials are tabulated in 
Table B.8 of Appendix B.
Other Heat Capacity Contributions
Other energy-absorptive mechanisms also exist that can add to the total heat capacity of a solid. In most instances, however, these are minor relative to the magnitude of the vibrational contribution. There is an electronic contribution in that electrons absorb energy by increasing their kinetic energy. However, this is possible only for free electrons— those that have been excited from filled states to empty states above the Fermi energy (Section 18.6). In metals, only electrons at states near the Fermi energy are capable of such transitions, and these represent only a very small fraction of the total number. An even smaller proportion of electrons experiences excitations in insulating and semicon-ducting materials. Hence, this electronic contribution is typically insignificant, except at temperatures near 0 K.Dependence of the

than its 𝜃D, the value of C𝜐 for a ceramic material is approximately 25 joules per mole of ions; the “molar” heat 
capacity of, say, Al2O3 is about (5)(25 J/mol ·K) = 125 J/mol ·K, given that there are five ions (two Al3+ ions and three 
O2− ions) per formula (Al2O3) unit.

19.3 Thermal Expansion  •   703
Most solid materials expand upon heating and contract when cooled. The change in 
length with temperature for a solid material may be expressed as follows:
 lf−l0
l0=𝛼l (Tf−T0 ) (19.3a)
or
 Δl
l0=𝛼l ΔT (19.3b)
where l0 and lf represent, respectively, initial and final lengths with the temperature 
change from T0 to Tf. The parameter 𝛼l is called the linear coefficient of thermal expansion;  
it is a material property that is indicative of the extent to which a material expands upon 
heating and has units of reciprocal temperature [( °C)−1 or (°F)−1]. Heating or cooling 
affects all the dimensions of a body, with a resultant change in volume. Volume changes with temperature may be computed from
 ΔV
V0=𝛼𝜐 ΔT (19.4)
where ΔV and V0 are the volume change and the original volume, respectively, and 
𝛼𝜐 is the volume coefficient of thermal expansion. In many materials, the value of 𝛼𝜐 is 
 anisotropic; that is, it depends on the crystallographic direction along which it is mea-
sured. For materials in which the thermal expansion is isotropic, 𝛼𝜐 is approximately 3𝛼l.
 From an atomic perspective, thermal expansion is reflected by an increase in the  average distance between the atoms. This phenomenon can best be understood by consulting the potential energy–versus–interatomic spacing curve for a solid material introduced previously (Figure 2.10 b) and reproduced in Figure 19.3a. The curve is in For thermal 
 expansion, dependence of fractional length change on the linear coefficient of thermal expansion and the temperature change

the form of a potential energy trough, and the equilibrium interatomic spacing at 0 K, 
r0, corresponds to the trough minimum. Heating to successively higher temperatures 
(T1, T2, T3, etc.) raises the vibrational energy from E1 to E2 to E3, and so on. The  average 
vibrational amplitude of an atom corresponds to the trough width at each tempera-ture, and the average interatomic distance is represented by the mean position, which  increases with temperature from r
0 to r1 to r2, and so on.
 Thermal expansion is due to the asymmetric curvature of this potential energy trough rather than the increased atomic vibrational amplitudes with rising temperature. If the potential energy curve were symmetric (Figure 19.3 b), there would be no net 
change in interatomic separation and, consequently, no thermal expansion. For each class of materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers), the greater the atomic bonding energy, the deeper and more narrow this potential energy trough. As a result, the increase in interatomic separation with a given rise in temperature is lower,  yielding a smaller value of 𝛼
l. Table 19.1 lists the linear coefficients of thermal expansion for 
 several materials. With regard to temperature dependence, the magnitude of the  coefficient of expansion increases with rising temperature. The values in Table 19.1 are taken at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. A more comprehensive list of coefficients of thermal expansion is provided in Table B.6 of Appendix B.
Metals
As noted in Table 19.1, linear coefficients of thermal expansion for some of the common metals range between about 5 ×  10
−6 and 25 ×  10−6 (°C)−1; these values are intermediate 
in magnitude between those for ceramic and polymeric materials. As the following Materials of Importance box explains, several low-expansion and controlled-expansion metal alloys have been developed which are used in applications requiring dimensional stability with temperature variations.
Ceramics
Relatively strong interatomic bonding forces are found in many ceramic materials, as reflected in comparatively low coefficients of thermal expansion; values typically range between about 0.5 × 10
−6 and 15 × 10−6 (°C)−1. For noncrystalline ceramics and also 
those having cubic crystal structures, 𝛼l is isotropic. Otherwise, it is anisotropic; some 
ceramic materials, upon heating, contract in some crystallographic directions while  expanding in others. For inorganic glasses, the coefficient of expansion is dependent on composition. Fused silica (high-purity SiO
2 glass) has a small expansion coefficient, 
0.4 × 10−6 (°C)−1. This is explained by a low atomic packing density such that intera-
tomic expansion produces relatively small macroscopic dimensional changes. Ceramic materials that are to be subjected to temperature changes must have  coefficients of thermal expansion that are relatively low and isotropic. Otherwise, these brittle materials may experience fracture as a consequence of nonuniform dimensional changes in what is termed thermal shock, as discussed later in the chapter.
Polymers
Some polymeric materials experience very large thermal expansions upon heating, as indicated by coefficients that range from approximately 50 × 10
−6 to 400 × 10−6 (°C)−1. 
The highest 𝛼l values are found in linear and branched polymers because the second-
ary intermolecular bonds are weak and there is a minimum of crosslinking. With in-creased crosslinking, the magnitude of the expansion coefficient decreases; the lowest  coefficients are found in the thermosetting network polymers such as phenol-formaldehyde, in which the bonding is almost entirely covalent.thermal shock

Invar and Other Low-Expansion AlloysMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 19.1
In 1896, Charles-Edouard Guillaume of France 
made an interesting and important discovery that 
earned him the 1920 Nobel Prize in physics: an iron–nickel alloy that has a very low (near-zero) coefficient of thermal expansion between room temperature and approximately 230°C. This material became the fore-runner of a family of “low-expansion” (also some-times called “controlled-expansion”) metal alloys. Its composition is 64 wt% Fe–36 wt% Ni, and it has been given the trade name of Invar because the length of a specimen of this material is virtually invariable with changes in temperature. Its coefficient of thermal ex-pansion near room temperature is 1.6 × 10
−6 (°C)−1.
One might surmise that this near-zero expansion is 
explained by a symmetrical potential energy–versus–interatomic distance curve (Figure 19.3 b). Such is 
not so; rather, this behavior relates to the magnetic characteristics of Invar. Both iron and nickel are fer-romagnetic materials (Section 20.4). A ferromagnetic material may be made to form a permanent and strong magnet; upon heating, this property disappears at a specific temperature, called the Curie temperature, which varies from one ferromagnetic material to an-other (Section 20.6). As a specimen of Invar is heated, its tendency to expand is counteracted by a contrac-tion phenomenon that is associated with its ferromag-netic properties (which is termed magnetostriction). Above its Curie temperature (approximately 230°C), Invar expands in a normal manner, and its coefficient of thermal expansion assumes a much greater value.
Heat-treating and processing of Invar also affects 
its thermal expansion characteristics. The lowest 𝛼
l 
values result for specimens quenched from elevated temperatures (near 800°C) that are then cold worked. Annealing leads to an increase in 𝛼
l.Other low-expansion alloys have been devel-
oped. One of these is called Super Invar because its thermal expansion coefficient [0.72 × 10
−6 (°C)−1] is 
lower than the value for Invar. However, the tempera-ture range over which its low expansion characteris-tics persist is relatively narrow. Compositionally, for Super Invar some of the nickel in Invar is replaced by another ferromagnetic metal, cobalt; Super Invar contains 63 wt% Fe, 32 wt% Ni, and 5 wt% Co.
Another such alloy, with the trade name of Kovar, 
has been designed to have expansion characteristics close to those of borosilicate (or Pyrex) glass; when joined to Pyrex and subjected to temperature vari-ations, thermal stresses and possible fracture at the junction are avoided. The composition of Kovar is 54 wt% Fe, 29 wt% Ni, and 17 wt% Co.
These low-expansion alloys are used in applications 
that require dimensional stability with temperature fluctuations, including the following:
 • Compensating pendulums and balance wheels for 
mechanical clocks and watches
 • Structural components in optical and laser measuring 
systems that require dimensional stabilities on the 
order of a wavelength of light
 • Bimetallic strips that are used to actuate micro-
switches in water-heating systems
 • Shadow masks on cathode ray tubes that are used for 
television and display screens; higher contrast, improved brightness, and sharper definition are pos-sible using low-expansion materials
 • Vessels and piping for the storage and piping of 
 liquefied natural gas

706  •   Chapter 19  /  Thermal Properties
Thermal conduction is the phenomenon by which heat is transported from high- to 
low-temperature regions of a substance. The property that characterizes the ability of a material to transfer heat is the thermal conductivity. It is best defined in terms of 
the expression
 
q=−k dT
dx (19.5)
where q denotes the heat flux, or heat flow, per unit time per unit area (area being taken 
as that perpendicular to the flow direction), k is the thermal conductivity, and dT/dx is 
the temperature gradient through the conducting medium.
 The units of q and k are W/m2 (Btu/ft2·h) and W/m ·K (Btu/ft ·h·°F), respectively. 
Equation 19.5 is valid only for steady-state heat flow—that is, for situations in which the 
heat flux does not change with time. The minus sign in the expression indicates that the direction of heat flow is from hot to cold, or down the temperature gradient. Equation 19.5 is similar in form to Fick’s first law (Equation 5.2) for steady-state diffusion. For these expressions, k is analogous to the diffusion coefficient D, and the temperature gradient is analogous to the concentration gradient, dC/dx.
Mechanisms of Heat Conduction
Heat is transported in solid materials by both lattice vibration waves (phonons) and free electrons. A thermal conductivity is associated with each of these mechanisms, and the total conductivity is the sum of the two contributions, or
 k=k
l+ke (19.6)
where kl and ke represent the lattice vibration and electron thermal conductivities, re-
spectively; usually one or the other predominates. The thermal energy associated with 
phonons or lattice waves is transported in the direction of their motion. The kl contribu-
tion results from a net movement of phonons from high- to low-temperature regions of a body across which a temperature gradient exists. Free or conducting electrons participate in electronic thermal conduction. A gain in kinetic energy is imparted to the free electrons in a hot region of the specimen. They then migrate to colder areas, where some of this kinetic energy is transferred to the atoms (as vibrational energy) as a consequence of collisions with phonons or other imperfections in the crystal. The relative contribution of k
e to the total thermal conduc-
tivity increases with increasing free electron concentrations because more electrons are available to participate in this heat transference process.
Metals
In high-purity metals, the electron mechanism of heat transport is much more efficient than the phonon contribution because electrons are not as easily scattered as phonons and have higher velocities. Furthermore, metals are extremely good conductors of heat because relatively large numbers of free electrons exist that participate in thermal  conduction. The thermal conductivities of several common metals are given in Table 19.1; values generally range between about 20 and 400 W/m
·K.
 Because free electrons are responsible for both electrical and thermal conduction in pure metals, theoretical treatments suggest that the two conductivities should be related according to the Wiedemann–Franz law:

temperature should be a constant19.4 THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY
19.4 Thermal Conductivity  •   707
where 𝜎 is the electrical conductivity, T  is the absolute temperature, and L  is a constant. 
The theoretical value of L , 2.44 ×  10−8 Ω ·W/(K)2, should be independent of temperature 
and the same for all metals if the heat energy is transported entirely by free electrons. 
Table 19.1 includes the experimental L  values for several metals; note that the agreement 
between these and the theoretical value is quite reasonable (well within a factor of 2). Alloying metals with impurities results in a reduction in the thermal conductivity, for the same reason that the electrical conductivity is decreased (Section 18.8); namely, the impurity atoms, especially if in solid solution, act as scattering centers, lowering the efficiency of electron motion. A plot of thermal conductivity versus composition for copper–zinc alloys (Figure 19.4) displays this effect.Figure 19.4  Thermal conductivity versus 
composition for copper–zinc alloys.

Ceramics
Nonmetallic materials are thermal insulators inasmuch as they lack large numbers of free 
electrons. Thus the phonons are primarily responsible for thermal conduction: ke is much 
smaller than kl. Again, the phonons are not as effective as free electrons in the transport 
of heat energy as a result of the very efficient phonon scattering by lattice imperfections. Thermal conductivity values for a number of ceramic materials are given in Table 19.1; room-temperature thermal conductivities range between approximately 2 and 50 W/m
·K. 
Glass and other amorphous ceramics have lower conductivities than crystalline ceramics because the phonon scattering is much more effective when the atomic structure is highly disordered and irregular. The scattering of lattice vibrations becomes more pronounced with rising tem-perature; hence, the thermal conductivity of most ceramic materials normally decreases with increasing temperature, at least at relatively low temperatures (Figure 19.5). As Figure 19.5 indicates, the conductivity begins to increase at higher temperatures, which is due to radiant heat transfer: significant quantities of infrared radiant heat may be

transported through a transparent ceramic material. The efficiency of this process in-
creases with temperature. Porosity in ceramic materials may have a dramatic influence on thermal conductivity; under most circumstances, increasing the pore volume results in a reduction of the ther-mal conductivity. In fact, many ceramics used for thermal insulation are porous. Heat 
transfer across pores is typically slow and inefficient. Internal pores normally contain still air, which has an extremely low thermal conductivity —approximately 0.02 W/m
·K. 
Furthermore, gaseous convection within the pores is also comparatively ineffective.Figure 19.5  Dependence of thermal 
conductivity on temperature for several 
ceramic materials.

Polymers
As noted in Table 19.1, thermal conductivities for most polymers are on the order of 
0.3 W/m ·K. For these materials, energy transfer is accomplished by the vibration and 
rotation of the chain molecules. The magnitude of the thermal conductivity depends on the degree of crystallinity; a polymer with a highly crystalline and ordered structure has a greater conductivity than the equivalent amorphous material because of the more  effective coordinated vibration of the molecular chains for the crystalline state. Polymers are often used as thermal insulators because of their low thermal conduc-tivities. As with ceramics, their insulative properties may be further enhanced by the

Thermal stresses are stresses induced in a body as a result of changes in temperature. An 
understanding of the origins and nature of thermal stresses is important because these stresses can lead to fracture or undesirable plastic deformation.
Stresses Resulting from Restrained Thermal Expansion and Contraction
Let us first consider a homogeneous and isotropic solid rod that is heated or cooled uniformly—that is, no temperature gradients are imposed. For free expansion or  contraction, the rod is stress-free. If, however, axial motion of the rod is restrained by rigid end supports, thermal stresses are introduced. The magnitude of the stress 𝜎 resulting 
from a temperature change from T
0 to Tf is
 𝜎=E𝛼l (T0−Tf)=E𝛼l ΔT (19.8)
where E is the modulus of elasticity and 𝛼l is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion. 
Upon heating (Tf > T0), the stress is compressive ( 𝜎 < 0) because rod expansion has 
been constrained. If the rod specimen is cooled (Tf < T0), a tensile stress is imposed 
 (𝜎 > 0). Also, the stress in Equation 19.8 is the same as the stress required to elastically 
compress (or elongate) the rod specimen back to its original length after it had been  allowed to freely expand (or contract) with the T
0 − Tf temperature change.thermal stress

710  •   Chapter 19  /  Thermal Properties
Stresses Resulting from Temperature Gradients
When a solid body is heated or cooled, the internal temperature distribution depends on 
its size and shape, the thermal conductivity of the material, and the rate of temperature change. Thermal stresses may be established as a result of temperature gradients across a body, which are frequently caused by rapid heating or cooling, in that the outside changes temperature more rapidly than the interior; differential dimensional changes restrain the free expansion or contraction of adjacent volume elements within the piece. For example, upon heating, the exterior of a specimen is hotter and, therefore, expands more than the interior regions. Hence, compressive surface stresses are induced and are balanced by tensile interior stresses. The interior–exterior stress conditions are reversed for rapid cooling such that the surface is put into a state of tension.
Thermal Shock of Brittle Materials
For ductile metals and polymers, alleviation of thermally induced stresses may be accom-plished by plastic deformation. However, the nonductility of most ceramics  enhances the 
possibility of brittle fracture from these stresses. Rapid cooling of a brittle body is more 
likely to inflict such thermal shock than heating because the induced  surface stresses are tensile. Crack formation and propagation from surface flaws are more probable when an imposed stress is tensile (Section 12.8). The capacity of a material to withstand this kind of failure is termed its thermal shock 
resistance. For a ceramic body that is cooled rapidly, the resistance to thermal shock de-pends not only on the magnitude of the temperature change, but also on the mechanical and thermal properties of the material. The thermal shock resistance is best for ceramics with high fracture strengths 𝜎
f and high thermal conductivities, as well as low moduli of 
elasticity and low coefficients of thermal expansion. The resistance of many materials to this type of failure may be approximated by a thermal shock resistance parameter TSR:
 
TSR  ≅ 𝜎fk
E𝛼l (19.9)
 Thermal shock may be prevented by altering the external conditions to the degree that cooling or heating rates are reduced and temperature gradients across a body are minimized. Modification of the thermal and/or mechanical characteristics in Equation 19.9 may also enhance the thermal shock resistance of a material. Of these parameters, the coefficient of thermal expansion is probably most easily changed and controlled. For example, common soda–lime glasses, which have an 𝛼
l of approximately 9 × 10−6 
(°C)−1, are particularly susceptible to thermal shock, as anyone who has baked can 
probably attest. Reducing the CaO and Na2O contents while at the same time adding 
B2O3 in  sufficient quantities to form borosilicate (or Pyrex) glass reduces the coefficient 
of expansion to about 3 × 10−6 (°C)−1; this material is entirely suitable for kitchen oven Definition of thermal 
shock resistance parameterexpansion from Table 19.1 is 20.0 ×  10−6 (°C)−1. Thus, solving for the final temperature

heating and cooling cycles.3 The introduction of some relatively large pores or a ductile 
second phase may also improve the thermal shock characteristics of a material; both 
impede the propagation of thermally induced cracks. It is often necessary to remove thermal stresses in ceramic materials as a means of improving their mechanical strengths and optical characteristics. This may be accom-plished by an annealing heat treatment, as discussed for glasses in Section 13.11.
3In the United States, some Pyrex baking glassware products are now made of less-expensive soda–lime glasses that 
have been tempered thermally. This glassware is not as resistant to thermal shock as a borosilicate glass. Consequently, 
a number of these baking dishes have shattered when subjected to reasonable temperature changes encountered  during normal baking activities, sending glass shards in all directions (and in some instances causing injuries). Pyrex glassware sold in Europe is much more thermally shock resistant. A different company owns the rights to the Pyrex name in Europe, and it still uses borosilicate glass in its manufacture.SUMMARY
Heat Capacity • Heat capacity represents the quantity of heat required to produce a unit rise in 
 temperature for 1 mole of a substance; on a per-unit-mass basis, it is termed specific heat.
• Most of the energy assimilated by many solid materials is associated with increasing 
the vibrational energy of the atoms.
• Only specific vibrational energy values are allowed (the energy is said to be quantized); 
a single quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon.
• For many crystalline solids and at temperatures within the vicinity of 0 K, the heat 
capacity measured at constant volume varies as the cube of the absolute temperature 
(Equation 19.2).
• In excess of the Debye temperature, C𝜐 becomes temperature independent, assuming 
a value of approximately 3R.
Thermal Expansion • Solid materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. The fractional change 
in length is proportional to the temperature change, the constant of proportionality being the coefficient of thermal expansion (Equation 19.3).
• Thermal expansion is reflected by an increase in the average interatomic separation, 
which is a consequence of the asymmetric nature of the potential energy–versus–interatomic spacing curve trough (Figure 19.3 a). The larger the interatomic bonding 
energy, the lower the coefficient of thermal expansion.
• Values of coefficients of thermal expansion for polymers are typically greater than 
those for metals, which in turn are greater than those for ceramic materials.
Thermal 
Conductivity• The transport of thermal energy from high- to low-temperature regions of a material 
is termed thermal conduction.
• For steady-state heat transport, flux may be determined using Equation 19.5.
• For solid materials, heat is transported by free electrons and by vibrational lattice 
waves, or phonons.
• The high thermal conductivities for relatively pure metals are due to the large 
 numbers of free electrons and the efficiency with which these electrons transport thermal 
energy. By way of contrast, ceramics and polymers are poor thermal conductors  because free-electron concentrations are low and phonon conduction predominates.
Thermal Stresses • Thermal stresses, which are introduced in a body as a consequence of temperature 
changes, may lead to fracture or undesirable plastic deformation.
712  •   Chapter 19  /  Thermal Properties
• One source of thermal stresses is the restrained thermal expansion (or contraction) of 
a body. Stress magnitude may be computed using Equation 19.8.
• The generation of thermal stresses resulting from the rapid heating or cooling of a 
body of material results from temperature gradients between the outside and interior 
portions and accompanying differential dimensional changes.
• Thermal shock is the fracture of a body resulting from thermal stresses induced by rapid temperature changes. Because ceramic materials are brittle, they are especially susceptible to this type of failure.

An understanding of the mechanism that explains the 
permanent magnetic behavior of some materials may allow us to alter and in some cases tailor the magnetic properties. For example, in Design Example 20.1 we note how the behavior of a ceramic magnetic ma-terial may be enhanced by changing its composition.WHY STUDY the Magnetic Properties of Materials?

7. Describe the phenomenon of superconductivity.
Magnetism —the phenomenon by which materials exert an attractive or repulsive force 
or influence on other materials—has been known for thousands of years. However, 
the underlying principles and mechanisms that explain magnetic phenomena are complex and subtle, and their understanding has eluded scientists until relatively 
recent times. Many modern technological devices rely on magnetism and magnetic 
 materials, includ ing electrical power generators and transformers, electric motors, 
radio, television, telephones, computers, and components of sound and video repro-duction systems. Iron, some steels, and the naturally occurring mineral lodestone are well-known examples of materials that exhibit magnetic properties. Not so familiar, however, is the fact that all substances are influenced to one degree or another by the presence of a magnetic field. This chapter provides a brief description of the origin of magnetic fields and discusses magnetic field vectors and magnetic parameters; diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, and ferrimagnetism; different magnetic materials; and superconductivity.
Magnetic Dipoles
Magnetic forces are generated by moving electrically charged particles; these magnetic forces are in addition to any electrostatic forces that may exist. Often it is convenient to think of magnetic forces in terms of fields. Imaginary lines of force may be drawn to indicate the direction of the force at positions in the vicinity of the field source. The magnetic field distributions as indicated by lines of force are shown for a current loop and a bar magnet in Figure 20.1. Magnetic dipoles are found to exist in magnetic materials and in some respects are analogous to electric dipoles (Section 18.19). Magnetic dipoles may be thought of as small bar magnets composed of north and south poles instead of positive and negative 20.1 INTRODUCTION

electric charges. In our discussion, magnetic dipole moments are represented by arrows, 
as shown in Figure 20.2. Magnetic dipoles are influenced by magnetic fields in a manner similar to the way in which electric dipoles are affected by electric fields (Figure 18.29). Within a magnetic field, the force of the field exerts a torque that tends to orient the dipoles with the field. A familiar example is the way in which a magnetic compass needle lines up with the Earth’s magnetic field.
Magnetic Field Vectors
Before discussing the origin of magnetic moments in solid materials, we describe mag-netic behavior in terms of several field vectors. The externally applied magnetic field, sometimes called the magnetic field strength, is designated by H. If the magnetic field 
is generated by means of a cylindrical coil (or solenoid) consisting of N closely spaced 
turns having a length l and carrying a current of magnitude I, then
 
H=NI
l (20.1)
A schematic diagram of such an arrangement is shown in Figure 20.3a. The magnetic 
field that is generated by the current loop and the bar magnet in Figure 20.1 is an H field. 
The units of H are ampere-turns per meter, or just amperes per meter. The magnetic induction, or magnetic flux density, denoted by B , represents the 
magnitude of the internal field strength within a substance that is subjected to an H magnetic field

permeability of a vacuum, 4 𝜋 × 10−7 H/m. (b) The

field. The units for B  are teslas [or webers per square meter (Wb/m2)]. Both B  and H 
are field vectors, being characterized not only by magnitude, but also by direction in 
space. The magnetic field strength and flux density are related according to
 
B=𝜇H (20.2)
The parameter 𝜇 is called the permeability, which is a property of the specific medium 
through which the H  field passes and in which B  is measured, as illustrated in Figure 20.3b . 
The permeability has dimensions of webers per ampere-meter (Wb/A ·m) or henries per 
meter (H/m).
 In a vacuum,
 B0=𝜇0H (20.3)
where 𝜇0 is the permeability of a vacuum, a universal constant, which has a value of 
4𝜋 × 10−7 (1.257 ×  10−6) H/m. The parameter B0 represents the flux density within a 
vacuum as demonstrated in Figure 20.3a .
 Several parameters may be used to describe the magnetic properties of solids. One 
of these is the ratio of the permeability in a material to the permeability in a vacuum, or
 𝜇r=𝜇
𝜇0 (20.4)
where 𝜇r is called the relative permeability, which is unitless. The permeability or rela-
tive permeability of a material is a measure of the degree to which the material can 
be magnetized, or the ease with which a B field can be induced in the presence of an 
external H field.
 Another field quantity, M, called the magnetization of the solid, is defined by the 
expression
 B=𝜇0H+𝜇0M (20.5)
In the presence of an H field, the magnetic moments within a material tend to become 
aligned with the field and to reinforce it by virtue of their magnetic fields; the term 𝜇0M 
in Equation 20.5 is a measure of this contribution.
 The magnitude of M is proportional to the applied field as follows:
 M=𝜒mH (20.6)
and 𝜒m is called the magnetic susceptibility, which is unitless.1 The magnetic susceptibil-
ity and the relative permeability are related as follows:

 There is a dielectric analogue for each of the foregoing magnetic field parameters. 
The B and H fields are, respectively, analogous to the dielectric displacement D and 
the electric field ℰ, whereas the permeability 𝜇 is analogous to the permittivity 𝜀 (cf. 
Equations 20.2 and 18.30). Furthermore, the magnetization M and polarization P are 
correlates (Equations 20.5 and 18.31). Magnetic units may be a source of confusion because there are really two systems in common use. The ones used thus far are SI [rationalized MKS (meter-kilogram-
second)]; the others come from the cgs–emu (centimeter-gram-second–electromagnetic 
unit) system. The units for both systems as well as the appropriate conversion factors are given in Table 20.1.
Origins of Magnetic Moments
The macroscopic magnetic properties of materials are a consequence of magnetic 
moments associated with individual electrons. Some of these concepts are relatively complex and involve some quantum mechanical principles beyond the scope of this discussion; consequently, simplifications have been made and some of the details omit-ted. Each electron in an atom has magnetic moments that originate from two sources. One is related to its orbital motion around the nucleus; because it is a moving charge, an electron may be considered to be a small current loop, generating a very small mag-netic field and having a magnetic moment along its axis of rotation, as schematically illustrated in Figure 20.4a.Table 20.1   Magnetic Units and Conversion Factors for the SI and cgs–emu Systems

 Each electron may also be thought of as spinning around an axis; the other mag-
netic moment originates from this electron spin, which is directed along the spin axis as shown in Figure 20.4b. Spin magnetic moments may be only in an “up” direction or in an antiparallel “down” direction. Thus each electron in an atom may be thought of as being a small magnet having permanent orbital and spin magnetic moments. The most fundamental magnetic moment is the Bohr magneton 𝜇
B, which is of 
magnitude 9.27 × 10−24 A ·m2. For each electron in an atom, the spin magnetic moment is 
±𝜇B (plus for spin up, minus for spin down). Furthermore, the orbital magnetic moment 
contribution is equal to ml𝜇B, ml being the magnetic quantum number of the electron, 
as mentioned in Section 2.3. In each atom, orbital moments of some electron pairs cancel each other; this also holds true for the spin moments. For example, the spin moment of an electron with spin up cancels that of one with spin down. The net magnetic moment, then, for an atom is just the sum of the magnetic moments of each of the constituent electrons, including both orbital and spin contributions, and taking into account moment cancellation. For an atom having completely filled electron shells or subshells, when all electrons are considered, there is total cancellation of both orbital and spin moments. Thus, materials composed of atoms having completely filled electron shells are not capable of being per-manently magnetized. This category includes the inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.) as well as some ionic materials. The types of magnetism include diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and ferromagnetism; in addition, antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism are consid-ered to be subclasses of ferromagnetism. All materials exhibit at least one of these types, and the behavior depends on the response of electron and atomic magnetic dipoles to the application of an externally applied magnetic field.Bohr magneton
Diamagnetism is a very weak form of magnetism that is nonpermanent and persists only while an external field is being applied. It is induced by a change in the orbital motion of electrons due to an applied magnetic field. The magnitude of the induced magnetic mo-ment is extremely small and in a direction opposite to that of the applied field. Thus, the relative permeability 𝜇
r is less than unity (however, only very slightly), and the magnetic 
susceptibility is negative—that is, the magnitude of the B field within a diamagnetic solid is less than that in a vacuum. The volume susceptibility 𝜒
m for diamagnetic solid materi-
als is on the order of −10−5. When placed between the poles of a strong electromagnet, 
diamagnetic materials are attracted toward regions where the field is weak. Figure 20.5a illustrates schematically the atomic magnetic dipole configurations for a diamagnetic material with and without an external field; here, the arrows represent atomic dipole moments, whereas for the preceding discussion, arrows denoted only elec-tron moments. The dependence of B on the external field H for a material that exhibits 
diamagnetic behavior is presented in Figure 20.6. Table 20.2 gives the susceptibilities of several diamagnetic materials. Diamagnetism is found in all materials, but because it is so weak, it can be observed only when other types of magnetism are totally absent. There are very few practical applications for this form of magnetism. For some solid materials, each atom possesses a permanent dipole moment by virtue of incomplete cancellation of electron spin and/or orbital magnetic moments. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the orientations of these atomic magnetic moments are random, such that a piece of material possesses no net macroscopic mag-netization. These atomic dipoles are free to rotate, and paramagnetism results when 
they preferentially align, by rotation, with an external field as shown in Figure 20.5 b. 
These magnetic dipoles are acted on individually with no mutual interaction between diamagnetism

adjacent dipoles. Inasmuch as the dipoles align with the external field, they enhance it, 
giving rise to a relative permeability 𝜇r that is greater than unity and to a relatively small 
but positive magnetic susceptibility. Susceptibilities for paramagnetic materials range from about 10
−5 to 10−2 (Table 20.2). A schematic B-versus-H curve for a paramagnetic 
material is shown in Figure 20.6. Both diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials are considered nonmagnetic because they exhibit magnetization only when in the presence of an external field. Also, for both, the flux density B within them is almost the same as it would be in a vacuum.Figure 20.5  (a) The atomic dipole con-

20.4 Ferromagnetism  •   721
Certain metallic materials possess a permanent magnetic moment in the absence of 
an external field and manifest very large and permanent magnetizations. These are the characteristics of ferromagnetism, and they are displayed by the transition metals 
iron (as BCC 𝛼-ferrite), cobalt, nickel, and some rare earth metals such as gadolinium 
(Gd). Magnetic susceptibilities as high as 10
6 are possible for ferromagnetic materials. 
Consequently, H < < M, and from Equation 20.5 we write
 B≅𝜇0M (20.8)
 Permanent magnetic moments in ferromagnetic materials result from atomic mag-netic moments due to uncanceled electron spins as a consequence of the electron struc-ture. There is also an orbital magnetic moment contribution that is small in comparison to the spin moment. Furthermore, in a ferromagnetic material, coupling interactions cause net spin magnetic moments of adjacent atoms to align with one another, even in the absence of an external field. This is schematically illustrated in Figure 20.7. The origin of these coupling forces is not completely understood, but they are thought to arise from the electronic structure of the metal. This mutual spin alignment exists over relatively large-volume regions of the crystal called domains (see Section 20.7).
 The maximum possible magnetization, or saturation magnetization, M
s, of a fer-
romagnetic material represents the magnetization that results when all the magnetic dipoles in a solid piece are mutually aligned with the external field; there is also a corresponding saturation flux density, B
s. The saturation magnetization is equal to the 
product of the net magnetic moment for each atom and the number of atoms present. For each of iron, cobalt, and nickel, the net magnetic moments per atom are 2.22, 1.72, and 0.60 Bohr magnetons, respectively.ferromagnetism

Saturation Magnetization and Flux Density Computations for Nickel
Calculate (a) the saturation magnetization and (b) the saturation flux density for nickel, which 
has a density of 8.90 g/cm3.

(0.60, as given above), the magnitude of the Bohr magneton 𝜇B, and the number N  of atoms 
per cubic meter, or
 Ms=0.60 𝜇BN (20.9)

and Avogadro’s number NA, as follows:

Antiferromagnetism
Magnetic moment coupling between adjacent atoms or ions also occurs in materials 
other than those that are ferromagnetic. In one such group, this coupling results in an antiparallel alignment; the alignment of the spin moments of neighboring atoms or ions in exactly opposite directions is termed antiferromagnetism. Manganese oxide (MnO) is 
one material that displays this behavior. Manganese oxide is a ceramic material that is ionic in character, having both Mn
2+ and O2− ions. No net magnetic moment is associated 
with the O2− ions because there is a total cancellation of both spin and orbital moments. 
However, the Mn2+ ions possess a net magnetic moment that is predominantly of spin 
origin. These Mn2+ ions are arrayed in the crystal structure such that the moments of 
adjacent ions are antiparallel. This arrangement is represented schematically in Figure 20.8. The opposing magnetic moments cancel one another, and, as a consequence, the solid as a whole possesses no net magnetic moment.
Ferrimagnetism
Some ceramics also exhibit a permanent magnetization, termed ferrimagnetism. The macroscopic magnetic characteristics of ferromagnets and ferrimagnets are similar; the distinction lies in the source of the net magnetic moments. The principles of ferrimag-netism are illustrated with the cubic ferrites.
2 These ionic materials may be represented 
by the chemical formula MFe2O4, in which M represents any one of several metallic 
elements. The prototype ferrite is Fe3O4—the mineral magnetite, sometimes called 
lodestone. The formula for Fe
3O4 may be written as Fe2+O2−–(Fe3+)2(O2−)3, in which the Fe 
ions exist in both +2 and +3 valence states in the ratio of 1:2. A net spin magnetic mo-ment exists for each Fe
2+ and Fe3+ ion, which corresponds to 4 and 5 Bohr magnetons, 
respectively, for the two ion types. Furthermore, the O2− ions are magnetically neutral. 
There are antiparallel spin-coupling interactions between the Fe ions, similar in char-acter to antiferromagnetism. However, the net ferrimagnetic moment arises from the incomplete cancellation of spin moments. Cubic ferrites have the inverse spinel crystal structure, which is cubic in symmetry and is similar to the spinel structure (Section 12.2). The inverse spinel crystal structure might be thought of as having been generated by the stacking of close-packed planes antiferromagnetism
ferrimagnetism20.5 ANTIFERROMAGNETISM AND FERRIMAGNETISM
2Ferrite in the magnetic sense should not be confused with the ferrite 𝛼-iron discussed in 
Section 9.18; in the remainder of this chapter, the term ferrite  indicates the magnetic ceramic. ferrite

of O2− ions. Again, there are two types of positions that may be occupied by the iron 
cations, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. For one, the coordination number is 4 (tetrahedral 
coordination)—that is, each Fe ion is surrounded by four oxygen nearest neighbors. For the other, the coordination number is 6 (octahedral coordination). With this inverse spinel structure, half the trivalent (Fe
3+) ions are situated in octahedral positions and 
the other half in tetrahedral positions. The divalent Fe2+ ions are all located in octa-
hedral positions. The critical factor is the arrangement of the spin moments of the Fe ions, as represented in Figure 20.9 and Table 20.3. The spin moments of all the Fe
3+ 
ions in the octahedral positions are aligned parallel to one another; however, they are directed oppositely to the Fe
3+ ions disposed in the tetrahedral positions, which are also 
aligned. This results from the antiparallel coupling of adjacent iron ions. Thus, the spin moments of all Fe
3+ ions cancel one another and make no net contribution to the 
magnetization of the solid. All the Fe2+ ions have their moments aligned in the same 
direction; this total moment is responsible for the net magnetization (see Table 20.3). Thus, the saturation magnetization of a ferrimagnetic solid may be computed from the product of the net spin magnetic moment for each Fe
2+ ion and the number of Fe2+ 
ions; this corresponds to the mutual alignment of all the Fe2+ ion magnetic moments in 
the Fe3O4 specimen.
 Cubic ferrites having other compositions may be produced by adding metallic ions that substitute for some of the iron in the crystal structure. Again, from the ferrite chem-ical formula M
2+O2−–(Fe3+)2(O2−)3, in addition to Fe2+, M2+ may represent divalent ions Figure 20.8  Schematic

such as Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, each of which possesses a net spin magnetic moment 
different from 4; several are listed in Table 20.4. Thus, by adjustment of composition, 
ferrite compounds having a range of magnetic properties may be produced. For exam-ple, nickel ferrite has the formula NiFe
2O4. Other compounds may also be produced 
containing mixtures of two divalent metal ions such as (Mn, Mg)Fe2O4, in which the 
Mn2+:Mg2+ ratio may be varied; these are called mixed ferrites.
 Ceramic materials other than the cubic ferrites are also ferrimagnetic and include the hexagonal ferrites and garnets. Hexagonal ferrites have a crystal structure similar to the inverse spinel crystal structure, with hexagonal symmetry rather than cubic. The chemical formula for these materials may be represented by AB

divalent metal such as barium, lead, or strontium, and B is a trivalent metal such as alu-minum, gallium, chromium, or iron. The two most common examples of the hexagonal ferrites are PbFe
12O19 and BaFe12O19.
 The garnets have a very complicated crystal structure, which may be represented by the general formula M

europium, gadolinium, or yttrium. Yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12), sometimes denoted 
YIG, is the most common material of this type. The saturation magnetizations for ferrimagnetic materials are not as high as for ferromagnets. However, ferrites, being ceramic materials, are good electrical insulators. For some magnetic applications, such as high-frequency transformers, a low electrical conductivity is most desirable.

20.5 Antiferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism  •   725
 The saturation magnetization is equal to the product of the number N′ of Bohr magnetons 
per cubic meter of Fe3O4 and the magnetic moment per Bohr magneton 𝜇B,
 Ms=N′𝜇B (20.11)
Now, N′ is just the number of Bohr magnetons per unit cell nB divided by the unit cell volume 
VC, or
 N′=nB
VC (20.12)
Again, the net magnetization results from the Fe2+ ions only. Because there are 8 Fe2+ ions per 
unit cell and 4 Bohr magnetons per Fe2+ ion, nB is 32. Furthermore, the unit cell is a cube, and 
VC = a3, a being the unit cell edge length. Therefore.

Solution
According to Example Problem 20.2, the saturation magnetization for Fe3O4 is 5.0 × 105 A/m. 
In order to increase the magnitude of Ms, it is necessary to replace some fraction of the Fe2+ 
with a divalent metal ion that has a greater magnetic moment—for example, Mn2+; from Table 
20.4, note that there are 5 Bohr magnetons/Mn2+ ion as compared to 4 Bohr magnetons/Fe2+. 
Let us first use Equation 20.13 to compute the number of Bohr magnetons per unit cell ( nB), 
assuming that the Mn2+ addition does not change the unit cell edge length (0.839 nm). Thus,

If we let x  represent the fraction of Mn2+ that substitute for Fe2+, then the remaining unsubsti-
tuted Fe2+ fraction is equal to (1 − x). Furthermore, inasmuch as there are 8 divalent ions per 
unit cell, we may write the following expression:
8[5x+4(1−x)]=33.45
which leads to x = 0.181. Thus, if 18.1 at% of the Fe2+ in Fe3O4 are replaced with Mn2+, the 
saturation magnetization will be increased to 5.25 × 105 A/m.
726  •   Chapter 20  /  Magnetic Properties
Temperature can also influence the magnetic characteristics of materials. Recall that 
raising the temperature of a solid increases the magnitude of the thermal vibrations of atoms. The atomic magnetic moments are free to rotate; hence, with rising temperature, the increased thermal motion of the atoms tends to randomize the directions of any mo-ments that may be aligned. For ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic materials, the atomic thermal motions counteract the coupling forces between the adjacent atomic dipole moments, causing some dipole misalignment, regardless of whether an external field is present. This results in a decrease in the saturation magnetization for both ferro- and ferrimagnets. The saturation magnetization is a maximum at 0 K, at which temperature the thermal vibrations are at a minimum. With increasing temperature, the saturation magnetization decreases gradually and then abruptly drops to zero at what is called the 
Curie temperature T
c. The magnetization–temperature behavior for iron and Fe3O4 
is represented in Figure 20.10. At Tc, the mutual spin-coupling forces are completely 
destroyed, such that for temperatures above Tc, both ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials 
are paramagnetic. The magnitude of the Curie temperature varies from material to ma-terial; for example, for iron, cobalt, nickel, and Fe
3O4, the respective values are 768 °C, 
1120 °C, 335 °C, and 585 °C.
 Antiferromagnetism is also affected by temperature; this behavior vanishes at what is called the Néel temperature. At temperatures above this point, antiferromagnetic ma-terials also become paramagnetic.Curie temperature20.6  THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON

20.7 Domains and Hysteresis  •   727
Any ferro- or ferrimagnetic material at a temperature below Tc is composed of 
small-volume regions in which there is a mutual alignment in the same direction of 
all magnetic dipole moments, as illustrated in Figure 20.11. Such a region is called a domain, and each one is magnetized to its saturation magnetization. Adjacent 
domains are separated by domain boundaries or walls across which the direction of magnetization gradually changes (Figure 20.12). Normally, domains are microscopic in size, and for a polycrystalline specimen, each grain may consist of more than a single domain. Thus, in a macroscopic piece of material, there are a large number of domains, and all may have different magnetization orientations. The magnitude of the M  field for the entire solid is the vector sum of the magnetizations of all the 
domains, each domain contribution being weighted by its volume fraction. For an unmagnetized specimen, the appropriately weighted vector sum of the magnetiza-tions of all the domains is zero. Flux density B and field intensity H are not proportional for ferro- and ferrimag-
nets. If the material is initially unmagnetized, then B varies as a function of H, as shown 
in Figure 20.13. The curve begins at the origin, and as H is increased, the B field begins 
to increase slowly, then more rapidly, finally leveling off and becoming independent of H. This maximum value of B is the saturation flux density B
s, and the correspond-
ing magnetization is the saturation magnetization Ms mentioned previously. Because 
the permeability 𝜇  from Equation 20.2 is the slope of the B-versus-H curve, note from 
Figure 20.13 that the permeability is dependent on H. On occasion, the slope of the 20.7 DOMAINS AND HYSTERESIS

728  •   Chapter 20  /  Magnetic Properties
B-versus-H curve at H = 0 is specified as a material property, which is termed the initial 
permeability 𝜇i, as indicated in Figure 20.13.
 As an H field is applied, the domains change shape and size by the movement of 
domain boundaries. Schematic domain structures are represented in the insets (labeled 
U through Z) at several points along the B-versus-H curve in Figure 20.13. Initially, the moments of the constituent domains are randomly oriented such that there is no net B 
(or M) field (inset U). As the external field is applied, the domains that are oriented 
in directions favorable to (or nearly aligned with) the applied field grow at the expense of those that are unfavorably oriented (insets V through X). This process continues with increasing field strength until the macroscopic specimen becomes a single domain, which is nearly aligned with the field (inset Y). Saturation is achieved when this domain, by means of rotation, becomes oriented with the H field (inset Z).
 From saturation—point S in Figure 20.14—as the H  field is reduced by reversal of 
field direction, the curve does not retrace its original path. A hysteresis effect is produced 
in which the B  field lags behind the applied H  field, or decreases at a lower rate. At zero 
H field (point R  on the curve), there exists a residual B  field called the remanence, or 
remanent flux density, B
r, the material remains magnetized in the absence of an external 
H field.
 Hysteresis behavior and permanent magnetization may be explained by the motion of domain walls. Upon reversal of the field direction from saturation (point S in Figure 
20.14), the process by which the domain structure changes is reversed. First, there is a rotation of the single domain with the reversed field. Next, domains having magnetic moments aligned with the new field form and grow at the expense of the former do-mains. Critical to this explanation is the resistance to movement of domain walls that occurs in response to the increase of the magnetic field in the opposite direction; this accounts for the lag of B with H, or the hysteresis. When the applied field reaches zero, there is still some net volume fraction of domains oriented in the former direction, which explains the existence of the remanence B
r.
 To reduce the B  field within the specimen to zero (point C on Figure 20.14), an H 
field of magnitude − Hc must be applied in a direction opposite to that of the original 
field; Hc is called the coercivity, or sometimes the coercive force. Upon continuation of 
the applied field in this reverse direction, as indicated in the figure, saturation is ultimately achieved in the opposite sense, corresponding to point S′. A second reversal of the field to 
the point of the initial saturation (point S ) completes the symmetrical hysteresis loop and 
also yields both a negative remanence (− B
r) and a positive coercivity (+ Hc).
 The B-versus-H curve in Figure 20.14 represents a hysteresis loop taken to satura-
tion. It is not necessary to increase the H field to saturation before reversing the field 
direction; in Figure 20.15, loop NP is a hysteresis curve corresponding to less than 
saturation. Furthermore, it is possible to reverse the direction of the field at any point along the curve and generate other hysteresis loops. One such loop is indicated on the saturation curve in Figure 20.15: For loop LM, the H field is reversed to zero. One 
method of demagnetizing a ferro- or ferrimagnet is to repeatedly cycle it in an H field 
that alternates direction and decreases in magnitude.
 At this point, it is instructive to compare the B-versus-H behaviors of paramagnetic, 
diamagnetic, and ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic materials; such a comparison is shown in Figure 20.16. The linearity of paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials may be noted in the small inset plot, whereas the behavior of a typical ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic is nonlinear. The rationale for labeling paramagnetics and diamagnetics as nonmagnetic materials is verified by comparing the B scales on the vertical axes of the two plots: At 
an H field strength of 50 A/m, the ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic materials flux density is 
on the order of 1.5 tesla, whereas for the paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials it is on the order of 5 × 10
−5 tesla.

730  •   Chapter 20  /  Magnetic Properties
The magnetic hysteresis curves discussed in Section 20.7 have different shapes depending 
on various factors: (1) whether the specimen is a single crystal or polycrystalline; (2) if it is polycrystalline, whether there is any preferred orientation of the grains; (3) the pres-ence of pores or second-phase particles; and (4) other factors such as temperature and, if a mechanical stress is applied, the stress state. For example, the B- (or M-) versus-H curve for a single crystal of a ferromagnetic material depends on its crystallographic orientation relative to the direction of the applied H field. This behavior is demonstrated in Figure 20.17 for single crystals of 
nickel (FCC) and iron (BCC), where the magnetizing field is applied in [100], [110], and [111] crystallographic directions, and in Figure 20.18 for cobalt (HCP) in [0001] and [101
0]/[112 0] directions. This dependence of magnetic behavior on crystallographic 
orientation is termed magnetic (or sometimes magnetocrystalline) anisotropy. For each of these materials, there is one crystallographic direction in which mag-netization is easiest—that is, saturation (of M ) is achieved at the lowest H  field; this is 
termed a direction of easy magnetization. For example, for Ni (Figure 20.17), this direc-tion is [111] inasmuch as saturation occurs at point A; for [110] and [100] orientations, saturation points correspond, respectively, to points B and C. Correspondingly, easy magnetization directions for Fe and Co are [100] and [0001], respectively (Figures 20.17 and 20.18). Conversely, a hard crystallographic direction is that direction for which satu-ration magnetization is most difficult; hard directions for Ni, Fe, and Co are [100], [111], and [101
0]/[112 0].
 As noted in Section 20.7, the insets of Figure 20.13 represent domain configura-tions at various stages along the B- (or M-) versus-H  curve during the magnetization 
of a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic material. Here, each of the arrows represents a domain’s direction of easy magnetization; domains whose directions of easy mag-netization are most closely aligned with the H  field grow at the expense of the other 
domains, which shrink (insets V through X). Furthermore, the magnetization of the single domain in inset Y also corresponds to an easy direction. Saturation is achieved as the direction of this domain rotates away from the easy direction into the direction of the applied field (inset Z).20.8 MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY

The size and shape of the hysteresis curve for ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials are of 
considerable practical importance. The area within a loop represents a magnetic energy loss per unit volume of material per magnetization–demagnetization cycle; this energy loss is manifested as heat that is generated within the magnetic specimen and is capable of raising its temperature. Both ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials are classified as either soft or hard on the 
basis of their hysteresis characteristics. Soft magnetic materials are used in devices that 
are subjected to alternating magnetic fields and in which energy losses must be low; one familiar example consists of transformer cores. For this reason, the relative area within the hysteresis loop must be small; it is characteristically thin and narrow, as represented in Figure 20.19. Consequently, a soft magnetic material must have a high initial perme-ability and a low coercivity. A material possessing these properties may reach its satura-tion magnetization with a relatively low applied field (i.e., may be easily magnetized and demagnetized) and still have low hysteresis energy losses. The saturation field or magnetization is determined only by the composition of the material. For example, in cubic ferrites, substitution of a divalent metal ion such as Ni
2+ 
for Fe2+ in FeO–Fe2O3 changes the saturation magnetization. However, susceptibility 
and coercivity ( Hc), which also influence the shape of the hysteresis curve, are sensitive 
to structural variables rather than to composition. For example, a low value of coercivity corresponds to the easy movement of domain walls as the magnetic field changes magni-tude and/or direction. Structural defects such as particles of a nonmagnetic phase or voids in the magnetic material tend to restrict the motion of domain walls and thus increase the coercivity. Consequently, a soft magnetic material must be free of such structural defects.soft magnetic

An Iron–Silicon Alloy Used in Transformer CoresMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 20.1
As mentioned earlier in this section, transformer 
cores require the use of soft magnetic materials, 
which are easily magnetized and demagnetized (and also have relatively high electrical resistivities). One alloy commonly used for this application is the iron–silicon alloy listed in Table 20.5 (97 wt% Fe–3 wt% Si). Single crystals of this alloy are magnet-ically anisotropic, as are also single crystals of iron (as explained previously). Consequently, energy losses of transformers could be minimized if their cores were fabricated from single crystals such that a [100]-type direction [the direction of easy magnetization (Figure 20.17)] is oriented parallel to the direction of an ap-plied magnetic field; this configuration for a trans-former core is represented schematically in Figure 20.20. Unfortunately, single crystals are expensive to prepare, and, thus, this is an economically unpracti-cal situation. A better, more economically attractive alternative—one used commercially—is to fabricate cores from polycrystalline sheets of this alloy that are anisotropic.
Often, the grains in polycrystalline materials are 
oriented randomly, with the result that their proper-ties are isotropic (Section 3.15). However, one way of developing anisotropy in polycrystalline metals is via plastic deformation, for example by rolling (Sec-tion 11.4, Figure 11.9b); rolling is the technique by which sheet transformer cores are fabricated. A flat sheet that has been rolled is said to have a rolling (or 
sheet) texture, or there is a preferred crystallographic 
orientation of the grains. For this type of texture, dur-ing the rolling operation, for most of the grains in the sheet, a specific crystallographic plane (hkl) becomes aligned parallel (or nearly parallel) to the surface of the sheet, and, in addition a direction [uvw] in that plane lies parallel (or nearly parallel) to the rolling direction. Thus, a rolling texture is indicated by the plane–direction combination, (hkl)[uvw]. For body-centered cubic alloys (to include the iron–silicon alloy mentioned earlier), the rolling texture is (110)[001], which is represented schematically in Figure 20.21. Thus, transformer cores of this iron–silicon alloy are fabricated so that the direction in which the sheet was rolled (corresponding to a [001]-type direction for most of the grains) is aligned parallel to the direction of the magnetic field application.

The magnetic characteristics of this alloy may be 
further improved through a series of deformation and heat-treating procedures that produce a (100)[001] texture.

20.10 Hard Magnetic Materials  •   733
 Another property consideration for soft magnetic materials is the electrical resistiv-
ity. In addition to the hysteresis energy losses described previously, energy losses may result from electrical currents that are induced in a magnetic material by a magnetic field that varies in magnitude and direction with time; these are called eddy currents. It 
is most desirable to minimize these energy losses in soft magnetic materials by increas-ing the electrical resistivity. This is accomplished in ferromagnetic materials by forming solid solution alloys; iron–silicon and iron–nickel alloys are examples. The ceramic fer-rites are commonly used for applications requiring soft magnetic materials because they are intrinsically electrical insulators. Their applicability is somewhat limited, however, inasmuch as they have relatively small susceptibilities. The properties of some soft mag-netic materials are shown in Table 20.5. The hysteresis characteristics of soft magnetic materials may be enhanced for some applications by an appropriate heat treatment in the presence of a magnetic field. Using such a technique, a square hysteresis loop may be produced, which is desirable in some magnetic amplifier and pulse transformer applications. In addition, soft magnetic ma-terials are used in generators, motors, dynamos, and switching circuits.Table 20.5  Typical Properties for Several Soft Magnetic Materials

Hard magnetic materials are used in permanent magnets, which must have a high resis-
tance to demagnetization. In terms of hysteresis behavior, a  hard magnetic material has 
high remanence, coercivity, and saturation flux density, as well as low initial perme-ability and high hysteresis energy losses. The hysteresis characteristics for hard and soft magnetic materials are compared in Figure 20.19. The two most important character-istics relative to applications for these materials are the coercivity and what is termed the energy product, designated as (BH)
max. This (BH)max corresponds to the area of the 
largest B–H rectangle that can be constructed within the second quadrant of the hyster-
esis curve, Figure 20.22; its units are kJ/m3 (MGOe).4 The value of the energy product is hard magnetic

representative of the energy required to demagnetize a permanent magnet—that is, the 
larger (BH)max, the harder the material in terms of its magnetic characteristics.
 Hysteresis behavior is related to the ease with which the magnetic domain bounda-ries move; by impeding domain wall motion, the coercivity and susceptibility are en-hanced, such that a large external field is required for demagnetization. Furthermore, these characteristics are related to the microstructure of the material.Figure 20.22  Schematic magnetization curve that

(Cu–Ni–Fe) alloys, and alnico (Al–Ni–Co) alloys—as well as the hexagonal ferrites (BaO–6Fe
2O3). Table 20.6 presents some critical properties of several of these hard 
magnetic materials. The hard magnetic steels are normally alloyed with tungsten and/or chromium. Under the proper heat-treating conditions, these two elements readily combine with carbon in the steel to form tungsten and chromium carbide precipitate particles, which are especially effective in obstructing domain wall motion. For the other metal alloys, an appropriate heat treatment forms extremely small single-domain and strongly magnetic iron–cobalt particles within a nonmagnetic matrix phase.Concept Check 20.6 It is possible, by various means (e.g., alteration of microstructure 
and impurity additions), to control the ease with which domain walls move as the magnetic fi eld is changed for ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. Sketch a schematic B-versus-H

High-Energy Hard Magnetic Materials
Permanent magnetic materials having energy products in excess of about 80 kJ/m3 
(10 MGOe) are considered to be of the high-energy type. These are recently developed 
intermetallic compounds that have a variety of compositions; the two that have found 
commercial exploitation are SmCo5 and Nd2Fe14B. Their magnetic properties are also 
listed in Table 20.6.
Samarium–Cobalt Magnets
 Samarium–cobalt, SmCo5, is a member of a group of alloys that are combinations of 
cobalt or iron and a light rare earth element; a number of these alloys exhibit high-energy, hard magnetic behavior, but SmCo
5 is the only one of commercial significance. The 
energy product of these SmCo5 materials [typically between 120 and 240 kJ/m3 (15 and 
30 MGOe)] are considerably higher than those of the conventional hard magnetic materials (Table 20.6); in addition, they have relatively large coercivities. Powder metallurgical tech-niques are used to fabricate SmCo
5 magnets. The appropriately alloyed material is first 
ground into a fine powder; the powder particles are aligned using an external magnetic field and then pressed into the desired shape. The piece is then sintered at an elevated temperature, followed by another heat treatment that improves the magnetic properties.
Neodymium–Iron–Boron Magnets
 Samarium is a rare and relatively expensive material; furthermore, the price of cobalt is variable, and its sources are unreliable. Consequently, the neodymium–iron–boron, Nd
2Fe14B, alloys have become the materials of choice for a large number and 
wide diversity of applications requiring hard magnetic materials. Coercivities and energy products of these materials rival those of the samarium–cobalt alloys (Table 20.6). The magnetization–demagnetization behavior of these materials is a function of do-main wall mobility, which is controlled by the final microstructure—that is, the size, shape, and orientation of the crystallites or grains, as well as the nature and distribution of any Table 20.6   Typical Properties for Several Hard Magnetic Materials

second-phase particles that are present. Microstructure depends on how the material is 
processed. Two different processing techniques are available for the fabrication of Nd2Fe14B 
magnets: powder metallurgy (sintering) and rapid solidification (melt spinning). The powder metallurgical approach is similar to that used for the SmCo
5 materials. For rapid solidifica-
tion, the alloy in molten form is quenched very rapidly such that either an amorphous or very fine-grained and thin solid ribbon is produced. This ribbon material is then pulverized, compacted into the desired shape, and subsequently heat-treated. Rapid solidification is the more involved of the two fabrication processes; nevertheless, it is continuous, whereas powder metallurgy is a batch process, which has its inherent disadvantages.
 These high-energy hard magnetic materials are used in a host of different devices 
in a variety of technological fields. One common application is in motors. Permanent magnets are far superior to electromagnets in that their magnetic fields are maintained continuously and without the necessity to expend electrical power; furthermore, no heat is generated during operation. Motors using permanent magnets are much smaller than their electromagnetic counterparts and are used extensively in fractional horsepower units. Familiar motor applications include cordless drills and screwdrivers; in automo-biles (starters; window winders, wipers, and washers; fan motors); in audio and video recorders; clocks; speakers in audio systems, lightweight earphones, and hearing aids; and computer peripherals.
Magnetic materials are important in the area of information storage; in fact, magnetic 
recording
5 has become virtually the universal technology for the storage of electronic 
information. This is evidenced by the preponderance of disk storage media [e.g., com-puters (both desktop and laptop), and high-definition camcorder hard drives], credit/debit cards (magnetic stripes), and so on. Whereas in computers, semiconductor ele-ments serve as primary memory, magnetic hard disks are normally used for secondary memory because they are capable of storing larger quantities of information and at a lower cost; however, their transfer rates are slower. Furthermore, the recording and television industries rely heavily on magnetic tapes for the storage and reproduction of audio and video sequences. In addition, tapes are used with large computer systems to back up and archive data. In essence, computer bytes, sound, or visual images in the form of electrical signals are recorded magnetically on very small segments of the magnetic storage medium—a tape or disk. Transference to (i.e., “writing”) and retrieval from (i.e., “reading”) the tape or disk is accomplished by means of a recording system that consists of read and write heads. For hard drives, this head system is supported above and in close proximity to the magnetic medium by a self-generating air bearing as the medium passes beneath at relatively high rotational speeds.
6 In contrast, tapes make physical contact with the 
heads during read and write operations. Tape velocities run as high as 10 m/s. As noted previously, there are two principal types of magnetic media— hard disk 
drives ( HDDs) and magnetic tapes —both of which we now briefly discuss.
Hard Disk Drives
Hard disk magnetic storage hard drives consist of rigid circular disks with diameters that range between about 65 mm (2.5 in.) and 95 mm (3.75 in.). During read and write 20.11 MAGNETIC STORAGE
5The term magnetic recording is often used to denote the recording and storage of audio or video-and-audio signals, 
whereas in the field of computing, magnetic storage is frequently preferred.
6It is sometimes stated that the head “flies” over the disk.

processes, disks rotate at relatively high velocities; 5400 and 7200 revolutions per min-
ute are common. Rapid rates of data storage and retrieval are possible using HDDs, as are high storage densities. For the current HDD technology, “magnetic bits” point up or down perpendicular to the plane of the disk surface; this scheme is appropriately called perpendicular mag-
netic recording (PMR), and is represented schematically in Figure 20.23. Data (or bits) are introduced (written) into the storage medium using an inductive write head. For one head design, shown in Figure 20.23, a time-varying write magnetic flux is generated at the tip of the main pole—a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic core ma-terial around which a wire coil is wound—by an electric current (also time variable) that passes through the coil. This flux penetrates through the magnetic storage layer into a magnetically soft underlayer and then reenters the head assembly through a return pole (Figure 20.23). A very intense magnetic field is concentrated in the storage layer beneath the tip of the main pole. At this point, data are written as a very small region of the storage layer becomes magnetized. Upon removal of the field (i.e., as the disk continues its rotation), the magnetization remains—that is, the signal (i.e., data) has been stored. Digital data storage (i.e., as 1s and 0s) is in the form of minute magnetiza-tion patterns; the 1s and 0s correspond to the presence or absence of magnetic reversal directions between adjacent regions. Data retrieval from the storage medium is accomplished using a magnetoresistive read head (Figure 20.23). During read-back, magnetic fields from the written magnetic patterns are sensed by this head; these fields produce changes in electrical resistance. The resulting signals are then processed so as to reproduce the original data. The storage layer is composed of granular media —a thin film (15 to 20 nm thick) 
consisting of very small (~10-nm diameter) and isolated grains of an HCP cobalt–chromium alloy that are magnetically anisotropic. Other alloying elements (notably Pt and Ta) are added to enhance the magnetic anisotropy as well as to form oxide grain-boundary segregants that isolate the grains. Figure 20.24 is a transmission electron micrograph that shows the grain structure of an HDD storage layer. Each grain is a single domain that is oriented with its c -axis (i.e., [0001] crystallographic 
direction) perpendicular (or nearly perpendicular) to the disk surface. This [0001] direction is the direction of easy magnetization for Co (Figure 20.18); thus, when magnetized, the direction of magnetization of each grain has this desired perpen-dicular orientation. Reliable storage of data requires that each bit written on the disk Figure 20.23  Schematic

encompasses approximately 100 grains. Furthermore, there is a lower limit to the 
grain size; for grain sizes below this limit, there is the possibility that the direction of magnetization will spontaneously reverse because of the effects of thermal agitation (Section 20.6), which causes a loss of stored data. The current storage capacities of perpendicular HDDs are in excess of 100 Gbit/in.

(1011 bit/in.2); the ultimate goal for HDDs is a storage capacity of 1 Tbit/in.2 (1012 bit/in.2).
Magnetic Tapes
The development of magnetic tape storage preceded that for the hard disk drives. Today, tape storage is less expensive than HDD; however, areal storage densities are lower for tape (by a factor of on the order of 100). Tapes [of standard 0.5-in. (12.7-mm) width] are wound onto reels and enclosed within cartridges for protection and to facilitate handling. During operation, a tape drive, using precision-synchronized motors, winds the tape from one reel onto another past a read/write head system in order to access a point of interest. Typical tape speeds are 4.8 m/s; some systems run as high as 10 m/s. Head systems for tape storage are similar to those employed for HDDs, as described previously. For the latest tape-memory technology, storage media are particulates of magnetic materials that have dimensions on the order of tens of nanometers: ferromagnetic metal particles that are acicular (needle-shaped), and hexagonal and tabular (plate-
shaped) ferrimagnetic barium–ferrite particles. Photomicrographs of both media types are shown in Figure 20.25. Tape products use one particle type or the other (not both Figure 20.24  Transmission electron 
micrograph showing the microstructure 
of the perpendicular magnetic record-ing medium used in hard disk drives. This “granular medium” consists of small grains of a cobalt–chromium alloy (darker regions) that are isolated from one another by an oxide grain-boundary segregant (lighter regions).

together), depending on application. These magnetic particles are thoroughly and 
uniformly dispersed in a proprietary high-molecular-weight organic binder material to form a magnetic layer approximately 50 nm thick. Beneath this layer is nonmagnetic thin-film support substrate between about 100 and 300 nm thick that is attached to the tape. Either poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is used for the tape. Both particle types are magnetically anisotropic —that is, they have an “easy” or 
preferential direction along which they may be magnetized; for example, for the metal particles, this direction is parallel to their long axes. During manufacture, these particles are aligned such that this direction parallels the direction of motion of the tape past the write head. Inasmuch as each particle is a single domain that may be magnetized only in one direction or its opposite by the write head, two magnetic states are possible. These two states allow for the storage of information in digital form, as 1s and 0s. Using the plate-shaped barium–ferrite medium, a tape-storage density of 6.7 Gbit/in.

has been achieved. For the industry-standard LTO tape cartridge, this density corresponds to a storage capacity of 8 Tbytes of uncompressed data.
Superconductivity is basically an electrical phenomenon; however, its discussion has been deferred to this point because there are magnetic implications relative to the su-perconducting state, and, in addition, superconducting materials are used primarily in magnets capable of generating high fields. As most high-purity metals are cooled down to temperatures nearing 0 K, the electrical resistivity decreases gradually, approaching some small yet finite value characteristic of the particular metal. There are a few materials, however, for which the resistivity abruptly plunges at a very low temperature, from a finite value to one that is virtually zero and remains there upon further cooling. Materials that display this behavior are called superconductors, and the temperature at which they attain 
superconductivity is called the critical temperature T
C.7 The resistivity–temperature 
behaviors for superconductive and nonsuperconductive materials are contrasted in 
Figure 20.26. The critical temperature varies from superconductor to superconductor but lies between less than 1 K and approximately 20 K for metals and metal alloys. Recently, it has been demonstrated that some complex oxide ceramics have critical temperatures of greater than 100 K. At temperatures below T
C, the superconducting state ceases upon application of 
a sufficiently large magnetic field, termed the critical field HC, which depends on tem-
perature and decreases with increasing temperature. The same may be said for current density—that is, a critical applied current density J
C exists below which a material is su-
perconductive. Figure 20.27 shows schematically the boundary in temperature-magnetic field-current density space separating normal and superconducting states. The position of this boundary depends on the material. For temperature, magnetic field, and current density values lying between the origin and this boundary, the material is superconduc-tive; outside the boundary, conduction is normal. The superconductivity phenomenon has been satisfactorily explained by means of a rather involved theory. In essence, the superconductive state results from attractive interactions between pairs of conducting electrons; the motions of these paired electrons become coordinated such that scattering by thermal vibrations and impurity atoms is superconductivity20.12 SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

perature in the scientific literature. They are different entities and should not be confused. In this discussion, they are

highly inefficient. Thus, the resistivity, being proportional to the incidence of electron 
scattering, is zero. On the basis of magnetic response, superconducting materials may be divided into two classifications, type I and type II. Type I materials, while in the superconducting state, are completely diamagnetic—that is, all of an applied magnetic field is excluded from the body of material, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect, which is illus-trated in Figure 20.28. As H is increased, the material remains diamagnetic until the critical magnetic field H
C is reached. At this point, conduction becomes normal, and 
complete magnetic flux penetration takes place. Several metallic elements, including aluminum, lead, tin, and mercury, belong to the type I group. Type II superconductors are completely diamagnetic at low applied fields, and field exclusion is total. However, the transition from the superconducting state to the normal state is gradual and occurs between lower critical and upper critical fields, designated H
C1 and HC2, respectively. The magnetic flux lines begin to penetrate into the body of 
material at HC1, and with increasing applied magnetic field, this penetration continues; 
at HC2, field penetration is complete. For fields between HC1 and HC2, the material exists 
in what is termed a mixed state —both normal and superconducting regions are present.
 Type II superconductors are preferred over type I for most practical applications by virtue of their higher critical temperatures and critical magnetic fields. The three Figure 20.26  Temperature dependence of the

most commonly used superconductors are niobium–zirconium (Nb–Zr) and niobium–
titanium (Nb–Ti) alloys and the niobium–tin intermetallic compound Nb3Sn. Table 20.7 
lists several type I and II superconductors, their critical temperatures, and their critical magnetic flux densities. Recently, a family of ceramic materials that are normally electrically insulative have been found to be superconductors with inordinately high critical temperatures. Initial research has centered on yttrium barium copper oxide, YBa
2Cu3O7, which has a 
critical temperature of about 92 K. This material has a complex perovskite-type crystal structure (Section 12.2). New superconducting ceramic materials reported to have even higher critical temperatures have been and are currently being developed. Several of these materials and their critical temperatures are listed in Table 20.7. The technological potential of these materials is extremely promising because as their critical temperatures are above 77 K, which permits the use of liquid nitrogen, a very inexpensive coolant in comparison to liquid hydrogen and liquid helium. These new ceramic superconductors are not without drawbacks, chief of which is their brittle nature. This characteristic limits the ability of these materials to be fabricated into useful forms such as wires. The phenomenon of superconductivity has many important practical implications. Superconducting magnets capable of generating high fields with low power consump-tion are being used in scientific test and research equipment. In addition, they are also used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the medical field as a diagnostic tool. Abnormalities in body tissues and organs can be detected on the basis of the production of cross-sectional images.

resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Numerous other potential applications of superconduct-
ing materials also exist. Some of the areas being explored include (1) electrical power transmission through superconducting materials—power losses would be extremely low, and the equipment would operate at low voltage levels; (2) magnets for high-energy par-ticle accelerators; (3) higher-speed switching and signal transmission for computers; and (4) high-speed magnetically levitated trains, for which the levitation results from magnetic field repulsion. The chief deterrent to the widespread application of these superconduct-ing materials is the difficulty in attaining and maintaining extremely low temperatures. It can be hoped that this problem will be overcome with the development of the new genera-tion of superconductors with reasonably high critical temperatures.
SUMMARY
• The macroscopic magnetic properties of a material are a consequence of interactions 
between an external magnetic field and the magnetic dipole moments of the constituent atoms.
• The magnetic field strength (H) within a coil of wire is proportional to the number 
of wire turns and the magnitude of the current and inversely proportional to the coil length (Equation 20.1).
• Magnetic flux density and magnetic field strength are proportional to one another.
In a vacuum, the constant of proportionality is the permeability of a vacuum 
(Equation 20.3).
When some material is present, this constant is the permeability of the material 
(Equation 20.2).
• Associated with each individual electron are both orbital and spin magnetic moments.
The magnitude of an electron’s orbital magnetic moment is equal to the prod- 
uct of the value of the Bohr magneton and the electron’s magnetic quantum number.
An electron’s spin magnetic moment is plus or minus the value of the Bohr mag-
neton (plus for spin up and minus for spin down).
• The net magnetic moment for an atom is the sum of the contributions of each of its 
electrons, in which there is spin and orbital moment cancellation of electron pairs. When cancellation is complete, the atom possesses no magnetic moment.
• Diamagnetism results from changes in electron orbital motion that are induced by an external field. The effect is extremely small (with susceptibilities on the order of −10
−5) and in opposition to the applied field. All materials are diamagnetic.
• Paramagnetic materials are those having permanent atomic dipoles, which are acted on individually and aligned in the direction of an external field.
• Diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials are considered nonmagnetic because the 
magnetizations are relatively small and persist only while an applied field is present.
• Large and permanent magnetizations may be established within the ferromagnetic 
metals (Fe, Co, Ni).
• Atomic magnetic dipole moments, which are of spin origin, are coupled and mutually 
aligned with moments of adjacent atoms.
• Antiparallel coupling of adjacent cation spin moments is found for some ionic ma-
terials. Those in which there is total cancellation of spin moments are termed antifer-
romagnetic.Basic Concepts

Paramagnetism

and Ferrimagnetism
Summary  •   743
• With ferrimagnetism, permanent magnetization is possible because spin moment can-
cellation is incomplete.
• For cubic ferrites, the net magnetization results from the divalent ions (e.g., Fe2+) 
that reside on octahedral lattice sites, the spin moments of which are all mutually 
aligned.
• With rising temperature, increased thermal vibrations tend to counteract the dipole 
coupling forces in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. Consequently, the satu-ration magnetization gradually decreases with temperature, up to the Curie tempera-ture, at which point it drops to near zero (Figure 20.10).
• Above T
c, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are paramagnetic.
• Below its Curie temperature, a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material is composed of 
domains —small-volume regions in which all net dipole moments are mutually aligned 
and the magnetization is saturated (Figure 20.11).
• The total magnetization of the solid is just the appropriately weighted vector sum of 
the magnetizations of all these domains.
• As an external magnetic field is applied, domains having magnetization vectors 
oriented in the direction of the field grow at the expense of domains that have unfa-vorable magnetization orientations (Figure 20.13).
• At total saturation, the entire solid is a single domain and the magnetization is aligned 
with the field direction.
• The change in domain structure with increase or reversal of a magnetic field is accom-
plished by the motion of domain walls. Both hysteresis (the lag of the B field behind 
the applied H field) and permanent magnetization (or remanence) result from the resistance to movement of these domain walls.
• From a complete hysteresis curve for a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic material, the 
following may be determined:
Remanence—value of the B field when H = 0 (B
r, Figure 20.14)
Coercivity—value of the H field when B = 0 (Hc, Figure 20.14)
• The M- (or B-) versus-H  behavior for a ferromagnetic single crystal is anisotropic —
that is, it depends on the crystallographic direction along which the magnetic field is applied.
• The crystallographic direction for which M
s is achieved at the lowest H field is an easy 
magnetization direction.
• For Fe, Ni, and Co, easy magnetization directions are, respectively, [100], [111], and 
[0001].
• Energy losses in transformer cores made of magnetic ferrous alloys may be minimized 
by taking advantage of anisotropic magnetic behavior.
• For soft magnetic materials, domain wall movement is easy during magnetization 
and demagnetization. Consequently, they have small hysteresis loops and low energy losses.
• Domain wall motion is much more difficult for the hard magnetic materials, which 
results in larger hysteresis loops; because greater fields are required to demagnetize these materials, the magnetization is more permanent.
• Information storage is accomplished by using magnetic materials; the two principal 
types of magnetic media are hard disk drives and magnetic tapes.The Influence of

• The storage medium for hard disk drives is composed of nanometer-size grains of an 
HCP cobalt–chromium alloy. These grains are oriented such that their direction of 
easy magnetization (i.e., [0001]) is perpendicular to the plane of the disk.
• For tape-memory storage, either needle-shape ferromagnetic metal particles or plate-
shape ferromagnetic barium–ferrite particles are used. Particle size is on the order of tens of nanometers.
• Superconductivity has been observed in a number of materials; upon cooling and 
in the vicinity of absolute zero temperature, the electrical resistivity vanishes (Figure 20.26).
• The superconducting state ceases to exist if temperature, magnetic field, or current 
density exceeds a critical value.
• For type I superconductors, magnetic field exclusion is complete below a critical field, 
and field penetration is complete once H
C is exceeded. This penetration is gradual 
with increasing magnetic field for type II materials.
• New complex oxide ceramics are being developed with relatively high critical tem-
peratures that allow inexpensive liquid nitrogen to be used as a coolant.Superconductivity

  •  747When materials are exposed to electromagnetic 
 radiation, it is sometimes important to be able to 
 predict and alter their responses. This is possible when we are familiar with their optical properties and  understand the mechanisms responsible for their  optical behaviors. For example, in Section 21.14 on optical fiber materials in communications, we note that the performance of optical fibers is increased by introducing a gradual variation of the index of refrac-tion (i.e., a graded index) at the outer surface of the fiber. This is accomplished by the addition of specific 
impurities in controlled concentrations.WHY STUDY the Optical Properties of Materials?
Optical property refers to a material’s response to exposure to electromagnetic radiation 
and, in particular, to visible light. This chapter first discusses some of the basic principles and concepts relating to the nature of electromagnetic radiation and its possible interactions with solid materials. Then it explores the optical behaviors of metallic and nonmetal-lic  materials in terms of their absorption, reflection, and transmission characteristics. 
The final sections outline luminescence, photoconductivity, and light amplification by  stimulated emission of radiation (laser), the practical use of these phenomena, and the use of optical fibers in communications.21.1 INTRODUCTIONLearning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Compute the energy of a photon given its 
 frequency and the value of Planck’s constant.
2.  Briefly describe the electronic polarization that 
results from electromagnetic radiation–atomic 
interactions, and cite two consequences of elec-tronic polarization.
3.  Briefly explain why metallic materials are opaque 
to visible light.
4. Define index of refraction.5.  Describe the mechanism of photon absorption 
for (a) high-purity insulators and semiconductors and (b) insulators and semiconductors that con-tain electrically active defects.
6.  For inherently transparent dielectric materials, 
note three sources of internal scattering that can lead to translucency and opacity.
7.  Briefly describe the construction and operation 
of ruby and semiconductor lasers.
In the classical sense, electromagnetic radiation is considered to be wavelike, consisting of 
electric and magnetic field components that are perpendicular to each other and also to the direction of propagation (Figure 21.1). Light, heat (or radiant energy), radar,  radio waves, and x-rays are all forms of electromagnetic radiation. Each is  characterized primarily by a specific range of wavelengths and also according to the technique by which it is generated. The electromagnetic spectrum of radiation spans the wide range from 𝛾-rays (emitted by ra-
dioactive materials) having wavelengths on the order of 10
−12 m (10−3 nm) through x-rays, 
ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and finally radio waves with wavelengths as long as 105 m. This 
spectrum is shown on a logarithmic scale in Figure 21.2.Basic Concepts
21.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION
748  •   Chapter 21  /  Optical Properties
 Visible light lies within a very narrow region of the spectrum, with wavelengths 
ranging between about 0.4 μm (4 × 10−7 m) and 0.7 μm. The perceived color is deter-
mined by wavelength; for example, radiation having a wavelength of approximately 0.4 μm appears violet, whereas green and red occur at about 0.5 and 0.65 μm, respec-
tively. The spectral ranges for several colors are included in Figure 21.2. White light is simply a mixture of all colors. The ensuing discussion is concerned primarily with this visible radiation, by definition the only radiation to which the eye is sensitive. All electromagnetic radiation traverses a vacuum at the same velocity, that of light—namely, 3 × 10
8 m/s (186,000 miles/s). This velocity, c, is related to the electric 
permittivity of a vacuum 𝜀0 and the magnetic permeability of a vacuum 𝜇0 through

Thus, there is an association between the electromagnetic constant c and these electrical 
and magnetic constants.
 Furthermore, the frequency 𝜈 and the wavelength λ  of the electromagnetic radiation 
are a function of velocity according to
 c=𝜆𝜈 (21.2)
Frequency is expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), and 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. Ranges 
of frequency for the various forms of electromagnetic radiation are also included in the 
spectrum (Figure 21.2). Sometimes it is more convenient to view electromagnetic radiation from a quantum-mechanical perspective, in which the radiation, rather than consisting of waves, is  composed of groups or packets of energy called photons. The energy E of a photon is 
said to be quantized, or can only have specific values, defined by the relationship
 
E=h𝜈=hc
𝜆 (21.3)
where h is a universal constant called Planck’s constant, which has a value of 6.63 ×  10−34 J·s. 
Thus, photon energy is proportional to the frequency of the radiation, or inversely pro-
portional to the wavelength. Photon energies are also included in the electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 21.2). When describing optical phenomena involving the interactions between radiation and matter, an explanation is often facilitated if light is treated in terms of photons. On other occasions, a wave treatment is preferred; both approaches are used in this discus-sion, as appropriate.For electromagnetic

When light proceeds from one medium into another (e.g., from air into a solid 
 substance), several things happen. Some of the light radiation may be transmitted through the medium, some will be absorbed, and some will be reflected at the interface between the two media. The intensity I
0 of the beam incident to the surface of the solid 
medium must equal the sum of the intensities of the transmitted, absorbed, and reflected beams, denoted as I
T, IA, and IR, respectively, or
 I0=IT+IA+IR (21.4)
Radiation intensity, expressed in watts per square meter, corresponds to the energy  being transmitted per unit of time across a unit area that is perpendicular to the  direction of propagation.Intensity of an 
 incident beam at an interface is equal to the sum of the  intensities 
of  transmitted,  absorbed, and  reflected beams21.3 LIGHT INTERACTIONS WITH SOLIDSConcept Check 21.1 Briefl  y discuss the similarities and differences between photons and

 An alternate form of Equation 21.4 is
 T+A+R=1 (21.5)
where T, A, and R represent, respectively, the transmissivity (IT/I0), absorptivity (IA/I0), 
and reflectivity (IR/I0), or the fractions of incident light that are transmitted, absorbed, 
and reflected by a material; their sum must equal unity because all the incident light is 
transmitted, absorbed, or reflected. Materials that are capable of transmitting light with relatively little absorption and reflection are transparent —one can see through them. Translucent materials are 
those through which light is transmitted diffusely; that is, light is scattered within the interior to the degree that objects are not clearly distinguishable when viewed through a  specimen of the material. Materials that are impervious to the transmission of visible light are termed opaque.
 Bulk metals are opaque throughout the entire visible spectrum—that is, all light ra-diation is either absorbed or reflected. However, electrically insulating materials can be made to be transparent. Furthermore, some semiconducting materials are transparent, whereas others are opaque.transparent

The optical phenomena that occur within solid materials involve interactions 
 between the electromagnetic radiation and atoms, ions, and/or electrons. Two of the most important of these interactions are electronic polarization and electron energy transitions.
Electronic Polarization
One component of an electromagnetic wave is simply a rapidly fluctuating electric field (Figure 21.1). For the visible range of frequencies, this electric field interacts with the electron cloud surrounding each atom within its path in such a way as to induce elec-tronic polarization or to shift the electron cloud relative to the nucleus of the atom with each change in direction of electric field component, as demonstrated in Figure 18.31 a. 
Two consequences of this polarization are as follows: (1) Some of the radiation energy may be absorbed, and (2) Light waves are decreased in velocity as they pass through the medium. The second consequence is manifested as refraction, a phenomenon to be discussed in Section 21.5.
Electron Transitions
The absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation may involve electron tran-sitions from one energy state to another. For the sake of this discussion, consider an isolated atom, the electron energy diagram for which is represented in Figure 21.3. An electron may be excited from an occupied state at energy E
2 to a vacant and higher-lying 
one, denoted E4, by the absorption of a photon of energy. The change in energy experi-
enced by the electron, ΔE, depends on the radiation frequency as follows:
 ΔE=h𝜈 (21.6)
where, again, h is Planck’s constant. At this point, it is important to understand several concepts: First, because the energy states for the atom are discrete, only specific ΔEs 
exist between the energy levels; thus, only photons of frequencies corresponding to the possible ΔEs for the atom can be absorbed by electron transitions. Furthermore, all of 
a photon’s energy is absorbed in each excitation event.For an electron 
transition, change in energy equals the product of Planck’s constant and the  frequency of  radiation absorbed (or emitted)21.4 ATOMIC AND ELECTRONIC INTERACTIONS
21.4 Atomic and Electronic Interactions   •  751
 A second important concept is that a stimulated electron cannot remain in an 
 excited state indefinitely; after a short time, it falls or decays back into its ground state, 
or unexcited level, with reemission of electromagnetic radiation. Several decay paths 
are possible, and these are discussed later. In any case, there must be a conservation of energy for absorption and emission electron transitions. As the ensuing discussions show, the optical characteristics of solid materials that relate to absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation are explained in terms of the electron band structure of the material (possible band structures are discussed in Section 18.5) and the principles relating to electron transitions, as outlined in the  preceding two paragraphs.excited state

Optical Properties of Metals
Consider the electron energy band schemes for metals as illustrated in Figures 18.4 a and 
18.4b ; in both cases, a high-energy band is only partially filled with electrons. Metals are 
opaque because the incident radiation having frequencies within the visible range excites 
electrons into unoccupied energy states above the Fermi energy, as demonstrated in Figure 21.4a ; as a consequence, the incident radiation is absorbed, in accordance with 
Equation 21.6. Total absorption is within a very thin outer layer, usually less than 0.1 μ m; 
thus only metallic films thinner than 0.1 μ m are capable of transmitting visible light.
 All frequencies of visible light are absorbed by metals because of the continuously available empty electron states, which permit electron transitions as in Figure 21.4 a. In 
fact, metals are opaque to all electromagnetic radiation on the low end of the frequency

spectrum, from radio waves, through infrared and the visible, and into about the middle of 
the ultraviolet radiation. Metals are transparent to high-frequency (x- and γ -ray) radiation.
 Most of the absorbed radiation is reemitted from the surface in the form of visible light of the same wavelength, which appears as reflected light; an electron transition accompanying reradiation is shown in Figure 21.4 b. The reflectivity for most metals is 
between 0.90 and 0.95; some small fraction of the energy from electron decay processes is dissipated as heat. Because metals are opaque and highly reflective, the perceived color is determined by the wavelength distribution of the radiation that is reflected and not absorbed. A bright silvery appearance when exposed to white light indicates that the metal is highly reflective over the entire range of the visible spectrum. In other words, for the reflected beam, the composition of these reemitted photons, in terms of frequency and number, is approximately the same as for the incident beam. Aluminum and silver are two metals that exhibit this reflective behavior. Copper and gold appear red-orange and yellow, respectively, because some of the energy associated with light photons having short wavelengths is not reemitted as visible light.
Light that is transmitted into the interior of transparent materials experiences a  decrease in velocity, and, as a result, is bent at the interface; this phenomenon is termed 
refraction. The index of refraction n of a material is defined as the ratio of the velocity 
in a vacuum c to the velocity in the medium 𝜐, or
 
n=c
𝜐 (21.7)
The magnitude of n (or the degree of bending) depends on the wavelength of the light. 
This effect is graphically demonstrated by the familiar dispersion or separation of a beam of white light into its component colors by a glass prism (as shown in the margin photograph on the next page). Each color is deflected by a different amount as it passes into and out of the glass, which results in the separation of the colors. Not only does the index of refraction affect the optical path of light, but also, as explained shortly, it influ-ences the fraction of incident light reflected at the surface. Just as Equation 21.1 defines the magnitude of c, an equivalent expression gives the velocity of light 𝜐 in a medium as

By virtue of their electron energy band structures, nonmetallic materials may be transparent 
to visible light. Therefore, in addition to reflection and absorption, refraction and  transmission phenomena must also be considered.Concept Check 21.3 Why are metals transparent to high-frequency x-ray and γ-ray radiation?

stance. From Equation 21.7, we have
 n=c
𝜐=√𝜀𝜇
√𝜀0𝜇0=√𝜀r 𝜇r (21.9)
where 𝜀r and 𝜇r are the dielectric constant and the relative magnetic permeability, 
respectively. Because most substances are only slightly magnetic, 𝜇r≅1, and
 n ≅√𝜀r (21.10)
Thus, for transparent materials, there is a relation between the index of refraction and 
the dielectric constant. As already mentioned, the phenomenon of refraction is related to electronic polarization (Section 21.4) at the relatively high frequencies for visible light; thus, the electronic component of the dielectric constant may be determined from index of refraction measurements using Equation 21.10. Because the retardation of electromagnetic radiation in a medium results from elec-tronic polarization, the size of the constituent atoms or ions has considerable influence on the magnitude of this effect—generally, the larger an atom or ion, the greater the electronic polarization, the slower the velocity, and the greater the index of refraction. The index of refraction for a typical soda–lime glass is approximately 1.5. Additions of large barium and lead ions (as BaO and PbO) to a glass increase n significantly. For 
example, highly leaded glasses containing 90 wt% PbO have an index of refraction of approximately 2.1. For crystalline ceramics with cubic crystal structures and for glasses, the index of refraction is independent of crystallographic direction (i.e., it is isotropic). Noncubic crystals, however, have an anisotropic n—that is, the index is greatest along the direc-
tions that have the highest density of ions. Table 21.1 gives refractive indices for several Index of refraction of

Nonmetallic materials may be opaque or transparent to visible light; if transparent, they often appear colored. In principle, light radiation is absorbed in this group of materials by two basic mechanisms that also influence the transmission characteristics of these nonmetals. One of these is electronic polarization (Section 21.4). Absorption by  electronic polarization is important only at light frequencies in the vicinity of the relaxation frequency of the constituent atoms. The other mechanism involves valence 21.7 ABSORPTIONWhen light radiation passes from one medium into another having a different index of refraction, some of the light is scattered at the interface between the two media, even if both are transparent. The reflectivity R represents the fraction of the incident light that is reflected at the interface, or

from a vacuum or air into a solid s, then
 R=(ns−1

 (21.13)
because the index of refraction of air is very nearly unity. Thus, the higher the index 
of refraction of the solid, the greater the reflectivity. For typical silicate glasses, the reflectivity is approximately 0.05. Just as the index of refraction of a solid depends on the wavelength of the incident light, so does the reflectivity vary with wavelength. Reflection losses for lenses and other optical instruments are minimized significantly by coating the reflecting surface with very thin layers of dielectric materials such as  magnesium fluoride (MgF
2).Definition of

band–conduction band electron transitions, which depend on the electron energy 
band structure of the material; band structures for semiconductors and insulators are  discussed in Section 18.5. Absorption of a photon of light may occur by the promotion or excitation of an electron from the nearly filled valence band, across the band gap, and into an empty state within the conduction band, as demonstrated in Figure 21.5 a; a free electron in the 
conduction band and a hole in the valence band are created. Again, the energy of ex-citation 
ΔE is related to the absorbed photon frequency through Equation 21.6. These 
excitations with the accompanying absorption can take place only if the photon energy is greater than that of the band gap E
g—that is, if
 hv>Eg (21.14)
or, in terms of wavelength,

 The minimum wavelength for visible light, λ (min), is about 0.4 μ m, and because

 However, the maximum wavelength for visible light, 𝜆(max), is about 0.7 μm;

𝜆(max)
 =(4.13×10−15 eV ·s)(3×108 m∕s)
7×10−7 m=1.8 eV  (21.16b)
This result means that all visible light is absorbed by valence band–conduction band 
electron transitions for semiconducting materials that have band gap energies less than about 1.8 eV; thus, these materials are opaque. Only a portion of the visible spectrum is absorbed by materials having band gap energies between 1.8 and 3.1 eV; consequently, these materials appear colored. Every nonmetallic material becomes opaque at some wavelength, which depends on the magnitude of its E
g. For example, diamond, having a band gap of 5.6 eV, is 
opaque to radiation having wavelengths less than about 0.22 μm.
 Interactions with light radiation can also occur in dielectric solids having wide band gaps, involving other than valence band–conduction band electron transitions. If impuri-ties or other electrically active defects are present, electron levels within the band gap may be introduced, such as the donor and acceptor levels (Section 18.11), except that they lie closer to the center of the band gap. Light radiation of specific wavelengths may be emitted as a result of electron transitions involving these levels within the band gap. For example, consider Figure 21.6 a, which shows the valence band–conduction band 
electron excitation for a material that has one such impurity level. Again, the electro-magnetic energy that is absorbed by this electron excitation must be dissipated in some manner; several mechanisms are possible. For one, this dissipation may occur via direct electron and hole recombination according to the reaction

which is represented schematically in Figure 21.5 b. In addition, multiple-step electron 
transitions may occur that involve impurity levels lying within the band gap. One 
 possibility, as indicated in Figure 21.6b, is the emission of two photons; one is emitted as the electron drops from a state in the conduction band to the impurity level, the other as it decays back into the valence band. Alternatively, one of the transitions may involve the generation of a phonon (Figure 21.6 c), in which the associated energy is dissipated 
in the form of heat. The intensity of the net absorbed radiation is dependent on the character of the medium and the path length within. The intensity of transmitted or nonabsorbed radiation

The phenomena of absorption, reflection, and transmission may be applied to the pas-
sage of light through a transparent solid, as shown in Figure 21.7. For an incident beam of intensity I
0 that impinges on the front surface of a specimen of thickness l and absorp-
tion coefficient 𝛽, the transmitted intensity at the back face IT is
 IT=I0 (1 − R)2e−𝛽l (21.19)
where R is the reflectance; for this expression, it is assumed that the same medium 
exists outside both front and back faces. The derivation of Equation 21.19 is left as a homework problem. Thus, the fraction of incident light that is transmitted through a transparent material depends on the losses that are incurred by absorption and reflection. Again, the sum of the reflectivity R, absorptivity A, and transmissivity T is unity according to Equation 21.5. Also, each of the variables R, A, and T depends on light wavelength. This is  demonstrated 
over the visible region of the spectrum for a green glass in Figure 21.8. For example, for light having a wavelength of 0.4 μm, the fractions transmitted, absorbed, and reflected are approximately 0.90, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively. However, at 0.55 μm, the respective 
fractions shift to about 0.50, 0.48, and 0.02.Intensity of radiation

the material appears colorless; examples include high-purity inorganic glasses and high-
purity and single-crystal diamonds and sapphire. Usually, any selective absorption is by electron excitation. One such situation involves semiconducting materials that have band gaps within the range of photon  energies for visible light (1.8 to 3.1 eV). Thus, the fraction of the visible light having  energies greater than E
g is selectively absorbed by valence band–conduction band electron 
transitions. Some of this absorbed radiation is reemitted as the excited electrons drop back into their original, lower-lying energy states. It is not necessary that this reemission occur at the same frequency as that of the absorption. As a result, the color depends on the frequency distribution of both transmitted and reemitted light beams. For example, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has a band gap of about 2.4 eV; hence, it  absorbs photons having energies greater than about 2.4 eV, which correspond to the blue and violet portions of the visible spectrum; some of this energy is reradiated as light having other wavelengths. Nonabsorbed visible light consists of photons having energies between about 1.8 and 2.4 eV. Cadmium sulfide takes on a yellow–orange color because of the composition of the transmitted beam. With insulator ceramics, specific impurities also introduce electron levels within the forbidden band gap, as discussed previously. Photons having energies less than the band gap may be emitted as a consequence of electron decay processes involving impurity  atoms or ions, as demonstrated in Figures 21.6 b and 21.6c . Again, the color of the material 
is a function of the distribution of wavelengths in the transmitted beam. For example, high-purity and single-crystal aluminum oxide or sapphire is colorless. Ruby, which has a brilliant red color, is sapphire to which has been added 0.5% to 2% chromium oxide (Cr
2O3). The Cr3+ ion substitutes for the Al3+ ion in the Al2O3 
crystal structure and introduces impurity levels within the wide energy band gap of the sapphire. Light radiation is absorbed by valence band–conduction band electron transitions, some of which is then reemitted at specific wavelengths as a consequence of electron transitions to and from these impurity levels. The transmittance as a function of wavelength for sapphire and ruby is presented in Figure 21.9. For the sapphire, transmit-tance is relatively constant with wavelength over the visible spectrum, which accounts 
for the colorlessness of this material. However, strong absorption peaks (or minima) occur for the ruby—one in the blue–violet region (at about 0.4 μm) and the other for 
yellow–green light (at about 0.6 μm). That nonabsorbed or transmitted light mixed with 
reemitted light imparts to ruby its deep red color. Inorganic glasses are colored by incorporating transition or rare earth ions while the glass is in the molten state. Representative color–ion pairs include Cu
2+, blue–green; 
Co2+, blue–violet; Cr3+, green; Mn2+, yellow; and Mn3+, purple. These colored glasses 
are also used as glazes and decorative coatings on ceramic ware.

The extent of translucency and opacity for inherently transparent dielectric materials 
depends to a great degree on their internal reflectance and transmittance characteristics. Many dielectric materials that are intrinsically transparent may be made translucent or even opaque because of interior reflection and refraction. A transmitted light beam is deflected in direction and appears diffuse as a result of multiple scattering events. Opacity results when the scattering is so extensive that virtually none of the incident beam is transmitted undeflected to the back surface. This internal scattering may result from several different sources. Polycrystalline specimens in which the index of refraction is anisotropic normally appear translucent. Both reflection and refraction occur at grain boundaries, which causes a diversion in the incident beam. This results from a slight difference in index of refraction n between 
adjacent grains that do not have the same crystallographic orientation. Scattering of light also occurs in two-phase materials in which one phase is finely dispersed within the other. Again, the beam dispersion occurs across phase boundaries when there is a difference in the refractive index for the two phases; the greater this  difference, the more efficient the scattering. Glass-ceramics (Section 13.3), which may consist of both crystalline and residual glass phases, appear highly transparent if the sizes of the crystallites are smaller than the wavelength of visible light and when the in-dices of refraction of the two phases are nearly identical (which is possible by adjustment of composition). As a consequence of fabrication or processing, many ceramic pieces contain some residual porosity in the form of finely dispersed pores. These pores also effectively  scatter light radiation. Figure 21.10 demonstrates the difference in optical transmission characteristics of single-crystal, fully dense polycrystalline, and porous (~5% porosity) aluminum oxide specimens. Whereas the single crystal is totally transparent, polycrystalline and porous materials are, respectively, translucent and opaque. For intrinsic polymers (without additives and impurities), the degree of translucency is influenced primarily by the extent of crystallinity.

 occurs at the boundaries between crystalline and amorphous regions, again as a result of 
different indices of refraction. For highly crystalline specimens, this degree of scattering is extensive, which leads to translucency and, in some instances, even opacity. Highly amorphous polymers are completely transparent.
Applications of Optical Phenomena
Some materials are capable of absorbing energy and then reemitting visible light in a phenomenon called luminescence.  Photons of emitted light are generated from elec-
tron transitions in the solid. Energy is absorbed when an electron is promoted to an excited energy state; visible light is emitted when it falls back to a lower energy state if 1.8 eV <  h𝜈 < 3.1 eV. The absorbed energy may be supplied as higher-energy electro-
magnetic radiation (causing valence band–conduction band transitions, Figure 21.6a ) 
such as ultraviolet light; other sources such as high-energy electrons; or heat, me-chanical, or chemical energy. Furthermore, luminescence is classified according to the magnitude of the delay time between absorption and reemission events. If reemission occurs for times much less than 1 s, the phenomenon is termed fluorescence; for longer 
times, it is called phosphorescence. A number of materials can be made to fluoresce or 
phosphoresce, including in some sulfides, oxides, tungstates, and a few organic materials. 
Typically, pure materials do not display these phenomena, and to induce them, impuri-ties in controlled concentrations must be added. Luminescence has a number of commercial applications. For example, fluorescent lamps consist of a glass housing coated on the inside with specially prepared tungstates or silicates. Ultraviolet light is generated within the tube from a mercury glow discharge, which causes the coating to fluoresce and emit white light. The new compact fluorescence 
lights (or lamps), or CLFs, are replacing general-service incandescent lights. These CFL bulbs are constructed from a tube that is curved or folded so as to fit into the space for-merly occupied by the incandescent bulb and also to mount in their fixtures. Compact fluorescents emit the same amount of visible light, consume between one-fifth to one-third of the electrical power, and have much longer lifetimes than incandescent bulbs. However, they are more expensive and disposal is more complicated because they contain mercury.luminescence

phosphorescence21.11 LUMINESCENCE
The conductivity of semiconducting materials depends on the number of free electrons 
in the conduction band and the number of holes in the valence band, according to Equation 18.13. Thermal energy associated with lattice vibrations can promote electron excitations in which free electrons and/or holes are created, as described in Section 18.6. Additional charge carriers may be generated as a consequence of photon-induced electron transitions in which light is absorbed; the attendant increase in conductivity is called photoconductivity. Thus, when a specimen of a photoconductive material is 
 illuminated, the conductivity increases. This phenomenon is used in photographic light meters. A photoinduced current is measured, and its magnitude is a direct function of the intensity of the incident light radiation, or the rate at which the photons of light strike the photoconductive material. Visible light radiation must induce electronic transitions in the photoconductive material; cadmium sulfide is commonly used in light meters. Sunlight may be directly converted into electrical energy in solar cells, which also use semiconductors. The operation of these devices is, in a sense, the reverse of that for the light-emitting diode. A p–n junction is used in which photoexcited electrons and 
holes are drawn away from the junction in opposite directions and become part of an external current, as illustrated in chapter-opening diagram ( a).

Light-Emitting DiodesMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 21.1
In Section 18.15 we discussed semiconductor 
p–n junctions, and how they may be used as 
diodes or as rectifiers of an electric current.1 In 
some situations, when a forward-biased potential of relatively high magnitude is applied across a p–n  
junction diode, visible light (or infrared radiation) is emitted. This conversion of electrical energy into light energy is termed electroluminescence, and the 
device that produces it is termed a light-emitting 
diode (LED). The forward-biased potential attracts electrons on the n -side toward the junction, where 
some of them pass into (or are “injected” into) the 
p-side (Figure 21.11a ). Here, the electrons are mi-
nority charge carriers and therefore “recombine” with, or are annihilated by, the holes in the region near the junction, according to Equation 21.17, where the energy is in the form of photons of light (Figure 21.11b ). An analogous process occurs on the 
p-side—holes travel to the junction and recombine 
with the majority electrons on the n -side.
 The elemental semiconductors silicon and  germanium are not suitable for LEDs due to the detailed nature of their band gap structures. Rather, some of the III-V semiconducting com-pounds such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), and indium phosphide (InP), and alloys composed of these materials (e.g., GaAs
xP1–x, where x  is a small 
number less than unity) are frequently used. The wavelength (i.e., color) of the emitted radiation is related to the band gap of the semiconductor (which is normally the same for both n - and p -sides 
of the diode). For example, red, orange, and  yellow colors are possible for the  GaAs–InP system. Blue and green LEDs have also been  developed us-ing (Ga,In)N semiconducting  alloys. Thus, with this complement of colors, full-color  displays are  possible using LEDs. Important applications for semiconductor LEDs include digital clocks and illuminated watch displays, optical mice (computer input devices), and film scan-ners. Electronic remote controls (for televisions, DVD players, etc.) also use LEDs that emit an in-frared beam; this beam transmits coded signals that are picked up by detectors in the receiving devices. In addition, LEDs are being used for light sources. They are more energy efficient than incandescent lights, generate very little heat, and have much longer lifetimes (because there is no filament that can burn out). Most new traffic control signals use LEDs in-stead of incandescent lights. We noted in Section 18.17 that some polymeric materials may be semiconductors (both n- and 
p-type). As a consequence, light-emitting diodes 
made of polymers are possible, of which there are two types: (1) organic light-emitting diodes  (or OLEDs), 
which have relatively low molecular weights; and (2) high-molecular-weight polymer light-emitting diodes  
(or PLEDs). For these LED types, amorphous

 polymers are used in the form of thin layers that 
are sandwiched together with electrical contacts (anodes and cathodes). In order for the light to be emitted from the LED, one of the contacts must be transparent. Figure 21.12 is a schematic illustration that shows the components and configuration of an OLED. A wide variety of colors is possible using OLEDs and PLEDs, and more than a single color may be produced from each device (which is not possible with semiconductor LEDs)—thus, combin-ing colors makes it possible to generate white light. Although the semiconductor LEDs currently have longer lifetimes than these organic emitters, OLEDs/PLEDs have distinct advantages. In addition to generating multiple colors, they are easier to fabri-cate (by “printing” onto their substrates with an ink-jet printer), are relatively inexpensive, have slimmer profiles, and can be patterned to give high-resolution and full-color images. OLED displays are being marketed for use on digital cameras, cell phones, and car audio components. Potential applications include larger displays for televisions, computers, and billboards. In addition, with the right combination of materials, these displays can also be flexible. Imagine having a computer monitor or television that can be rolled up like a projection screen, or a lighting fixture that is wrapped around an architectural column or is mounted on a room wall to make ever-changing wallpaper.

All the radiative electron transitions heretofore discussed are spontaneous —that is, an 
electron falls from a high-energy state to a lower-energy state without any external 
provocation. These transition events occur independently of one another and at random times, producing radiation that is incoherent —that is, the light waves are out of phase 
with one another. With lasers, however, coherent light is generated by electron transitions initiated by an external stimulus— laser is just the acronym for light amplification by 
stimulated emission of radiation.
 Although there are several different varieties of laser, we explain the principles of operation using the solid-state ruby laser. Ruby is a single crystal of Al
2O3 (sapphire) to 
which has been added on the order of 0.05% Cr3+ ions. As previously explained (Section 
21.9), these ions impart to ruby its characteristic red color; more important, they provide electron states that are essential for the laser to function. The ruby laser is in the form of a rod, the ends of which are flat, parallel, and highly polished. Both ends are silvered such that one is totally reflecting and the other partially transmitting. The ruby is illuminated with light from a xenon flash lamp (Figure 21.13). Before this exposure, virtually all the Cr
3+ ions are in their ground states; that is, electrons fill 
the lowest energy levels, as represented schematically in Figure 21.14. However, pho-tons of wavelength 0.56 μm from the xenon lamp excite electrons from the Cr
3+ ions 
into higher-energy states. These electrons can decay back into their ground state by two different paths. Some fall back directly; associated photon emissions are not part of the laser beam. Other electrons decay into a metastable intermediate state (path EM, 
Figure 21.14), where they may reside for up to 3 ms (milliseconds) before spontaneous emission (path MG). In terms of electronic processes, 3 ms is a relatively long time, which means that a large number of these metastable states may become occupied. This situation is indicated in Figure 21.15 b.
 The initial spontaneous photon emission by a few of these electrons is the stimulus that triggers an avalanche of emissions from the remaining electrons in the metastable state (Figure 21.15c). Of the photons directed parallel to the long axis of the ruby rod, some are transmitted through the partially silvered end; others, incident to the totally laser21.13 LASERS

The light beam repeatedly travels back and forth along the rod length, and its intensity increases as more emissions are stimulated. Ultimately, a high-intensity, coherent, and highly collimated laser light beam of short duration is transmitted through the partially silvered end of the rod (Figure 21.15e). This monochromatic red beam has a wavelength of 0.6943 μm. Semiconducting materials such as gallium arsenide may also be used as lasers in compact disc players and in the modern telecommunications industry. One requirement of these semiconducting materials is that the wavelength λ associated with the band gap 
energy E
g must correspond to visible light—that is, from a modification of Equation 21.3, 
namely
 𝜆=hc
Eg (21.20)
we see that the value of 𝜆 must lie between 0.4 and 0.7 μm. A voltage applied to the 
material excites electrons from the valence band, across the band gap, and into the con-
duction band; correspondingly, holes are created in the valence band. This process is dem-
onstrated in Figure 21.16a , which shows the energy band scheme over some region of the 
semiconducting material, along with several holes and excited electrons. Subsequently, a few of these excited electrons and holes spontaneously recombine. For each recombi-nation event, a photon of light having a wavelength given by Equation 21.20 is emitted (Figure 21.16 a). One such photon stimulates the recombination of other excited elec-
tron–hole pairs (Figure 21.16b–f ) and the production of additional photons that have Figure 21.15  Schematic representations

the same wavelength and are all in phase with one another and with the original photon; 
thus, a monochromatic and coherent beam results. As with the ruby laser (Figure 21.15), one end of the semiconductor laser is totally reflecting; at this end, the beam is reflected back into the material so that additional recombinations will be stimulated. The other end of the laser is partially reflecting, which allows for some of the beam to escape. With this type of laser, a continuous beam is produced inasmuch as a constant applied voltage ensures that there is always a steady source of holes and excited electrons. The semiconductor laser is composed of several layers of semiconducting materials that have different compositions and are sandwiched between a heat sink and a metal conductor; a typical arrangement is represented schematically in Figure 21.17. The com-positions of the layers are chosen so as to confine both the excited electrons and holes, as well as the laser beam, to within the central gallium arsenide layer.Figure 21.16  For the semiconductor laser, schematic representations of stimulated recombination of excited

Lasers are also used as light sources for optical communication systems. Furthermore, 
 because the beam is highly coherent, lasers may be used for making very precise  distance measurements.
The communications field recently experienced a revolution with the development of opti-cal fiber technology; virtually all telecommunications now are transmitted via this medium rather than through copper wires. Signal transmission through a metallic wire conductor is electronic (i.e., by electrons), whereas using optically transparent fibers, signal transmission is photonic, meaning that it uses photons of electromagnetic or light radiation. Use of fiber-
optic systems has improved speed of transmission, information density, and transmission distance, with a reduction in error rate; furthermore, there is no electromagnetic interfer-ence with fibers. The bandwidth (i.e., data transfer rate) of optical fibers is amazing; in 1 s, an optical fiber can transmit 15.5 terabits of data over a distance of 7000 km (4350 mi); at this rate it would take approximately 30 s to transmit the entire iTunes catalog from New York to London. A single fiber is capable of transmitting 250 million phone conversations every second. It would require 30,000 kg (33 tons) of copper to transmit the same amount of information over one mile as only 0.1 kg ( 
1
4  lbm) of optical fiber does.
 The present treatment centers on the characteristics of optical fibers; however, it is worthwhile to first briefly discuss the components and operation of the transmission system. A schematic diagram showing these components is presented in Figure 21.18. The information (e.g., a telephone conversation) in electronic form must first be digi-tized into bits—that is, 1s and 0s; this is accomplished in the encoder. It is next necessary to convert this electrical signal into an optical (photonic) one, which takes place in the electrical-to-optical converter (Figure 21.18). This converter is normally a semiconduc-tor laser, as described in the previous section, which emits monochromatic and coherent light. The wavelength normally lies between 0.78 and 1.6 μm, which is in the infrared 
region of the electromagnetic spectrum; absorption losses are low within this range of wavelengths. The output from this laser converter is in the form of pulses of light; a binary 1 is represented by a high-power pulse (Figure 21.19 a), whereas a 0 corresponds 
to a low-power pulse (or the absence of one), (Figure 21.19b). These photonic pulse signals are then fed into and carried through the fiber-optic cable (sometimes called a waveguide) to the receiving end. For long transmissions, repeaters may be required; 
these are devices that amplify and regenerate the signal. Finally, at the receiving end the photonic signal is reconverted to an electronic one and then decoded (undigitized). The heart of this communication system is the optical fiber. It must guide these light pulses over long distances without significant signal power loss (i.e., attenuation) and pulse distortion. Fiber components are the core, cladding, and coating; these are represented in the cross-section profile shown in Figure 21.20. The signal passes through the core, whereas the surrounding cladding constrains the light rays to travel within the core; the outer coating protects core and cladding from damage that might result from abrasion and external pressures. High-purity silica glass is used as the fiber material; fiber diameters normally range between about 5 and 100 μm. The fibers are relatively flaw-free and, thus, remarkably 21.14 OPTICAL FIBERS IN COMMUNICATIONS

strong; during production the continuous fibers are tested to ensure that they meet 
minimum strength standards. Containment of the light to within the fiber core is made possible by total internal reflection—that is, any light rays traveling at oblique angles to the fiber axis are reflected back into the core. Internal reflection is accomplished by varying the index of refraction of the core and cladding glass materials. In this regard, two design types are used. With one type (termed step-index), the index of refraction of the cladding is slightly lower than that of the core. The index profile and the manner of internal reflection are shown in Figures 21.21b and 21.21d. For this design, the output pulse is broader than the input one (Figures 21.21c and 21.21e), a phenomenon that is undesirable because it limits the rate of transmission. Pulse broadening results because various light rays, although injected at approximately the same instant, arrive at the output at different times; they traverse different trajectories and, thus, have a variety of path lengths. Pulse broadening is largely avoided by use of the graded-index design. Here, impu-
rities such as boron oxide (B
2O3) or germanium dioxide (GeO2) are added to the silica 
glass such that the index of refraction is made to vary parabolically across the cross section (Figure 21.22b). Thus, the velocity of light within the core varies with radial position, being greater at the periphery than at the center. Consequently, light rays that traverse longer path lengths through the outer periphery of the core travel faster in this

lower-index material and arrive at the output at approximately the same time as undevi-
ated rays that pass through the center portion of the core. Exceptionally pure and high-quality fibers are fabricated using advanced and  sophisticated processing techniques, which are not discussed here. Impurities and other defects that absorb, scatter, and thus attenuate the light beam must be eliminated. The presence of copper, iron, and vanadium is especially detrimental; their concentrations are reduced to on the order of several parts per billion. Likewise, water and hydroxyl contaminant contents are extremely low. Uniformity of fiber cross-sectional dimen-sions and core roundness is critical; tolerances of these parameters to within 1 μ m over 
1 km (0.6 mile) of length are possible. In addition, bubbles within the glass and surface defects have been virtually eliminated. The attenuation of light in this glass material is imperceptibly small. For example, the power loss through a 16-km (10-mile) thickness of optical-fiber glass is equivalent to the power loss through a 25-mm (1-in.) thickness of ordinary window glass!

SUMMARY
• The optical behavior of a solid material is a function of its interactions with 
 electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths within the visible region of the spectrum (about 0.4 μm to 0.7 μm).
• From a quantum-mechanical perspective, electromagnetic radiation may be considered 
to be composed of photons—groups or packets of energy that are quantized —that is, 
they can have only specific values of energy.
• Photon energy is equal to the product of Planck’s constant and radiation frequency 
(Equation 21.3).Electromagnetic 
Radiation
Light Interactions 
with Solids• Possible interactive phenomena that may occur as light radiation passes from one 
medium to another are refraction, reflection, absorption, and transmission.
• Regarding degree of light transmissivity, materials are classified as follows:
Transparent —light is transmitted through the material with very little absorption 
and reflection.
Translucent —light is transmitted diffusely; there is some scattering within the 
interior of the material.
Opaque —virtually all light is scattered or reflected such that none is transmitted 
through the material.
Summary  •   771
• One possible interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter is electronic 
polarization—the electric field component of a light wave induces a shift of the electron 
cloud around an atom relative to its nucleus (Figure 18.31 a).
• Two consequences of electronic polarization are absorption and refraction of light.
• Electromagnetic radiation may be absorbed by causing the excitation of electrons 
from one energy state to a higher state (Figure 21.3).Atomic and 
Electronic 
Interactions
Optical Properties 
of Metals• Metals appear opaque as a result of the absorption and then reemission of light radiation 
within a thin outer surface layer.
• Absorption occurs via the excitation of electrons from occupied energy states to 
 unoccupied ones above the Fermi energy level (Figure 21.4a). Reemission takes place 
by decay electron transitions in the reverse direction (Figure 21.4 b).
• The perceived color of a metal is determined by the spectral composition of the 
 reflected light.
Refraction • Light radiation experiences refraction in transparent materials—that is, its velocity is 
decreased, and the light beam is bent at the interface.
• The phenomenon of refraction is a consequence of electronic polarization of the 
 atoms or ions. The larger an atom or ion, the greater the index of refraction.
Reflection • When light passes from one transparent medium to another having a different index 
of refraction, some of it is reflected at the interface.
• The degree of the reflectance depends on the indices of refraction of both media, as 
well as the angle of incidence. For normal incidence, reflectivity may be calculated 
using Equation 21.12.
Absorption • Pure nonmetallic materials are either intrinsically transparent or opaque.
Opacity results in relatively narrow-band-gap materials ( Eg < 1.8 eV) as a result 
of absorption whereby a photon’s energy is sufficient to promote valence band–conduction band electron transitions (Figure 21.5).
Transparent nonmetals have band gaps greater than 3.1 eV.For nonmetallic materials that have band gaps between 1.8 and 3.1 eV, only a 
portion of the visible spectrum is absorbed; these materials appear colored.
• Some light absorption occurs in even transparent materials as a consequence of 
 electronic polarization.
• For wide-band-gap insulators that contain impurities, decay processes involving 
 excited electrons to states within the band gap are possible with the emission of  photons having energies less than the band gap energy (Figure 21.6).
Color • Transparent materials appear colored as a consequence of specific wavelength ranges 
of light that are selectively absorbed (usually by electron excitations).
• The color discerned is a result of the distribution of wavelength ranges in the 
 transmitted beam.
Opacity and 
Translucency in 
Insulators• Normally transparent materials may be made translucent or even opaque if the incident 
light beam experiences interior reflection and/or refraction.
• Translucency and opacity as a result of internal scattering may occur as follows:
 (1) in polycrystalline materials that have anisotropic indices of refraction (2) in two-phase materials
772  •   Chapter 21  /  Optical Properties
(3) in materials containing small pores
(4) in highly crystalline polymers
Luminescence • With luminescence, energy is absorbed as a consequence of electron excitations, 
which is subsequently reemitted as visible light.
When light is reemitted less than 1 s after excitation, the phenomenon is called 
fluorescence.
For longer reemission times, the term phosphorescence is used.
• Electroluminescence is the phenomenon by which light is emitted as a result of 
electron–hole recombination events that are induced in a forward-biased diode (Figure 21.11).
• The device that experiences electroluminescence is the light-emitting diode (LED).
Photoconductivity • Photoconductivity is the phenomenon by which the electrical conductivity of some semiconductors may be enhanced by photo-induced electron transitions, by which additional free electrons and holes are generated.
Lasers • Coherent and high-intensity light beams are produced in lasers by stimulated electron 
transitions.
• With the ruby laser, a beam is generated by electrons that decay back into their 
ground Cr
3+ states from metastable excited states.
• The beam from a semiconducting laser results from the recombination of excited 
electrons in the conduction band with valence band holes.
Optical Fibers in 
Communications• Use of fiber-optic technology in modern telecommunications provides for the 
 transmission of information that is interference-free, rapid, and intense.
• An optical fiber is composed of the following elements:
A core through which the pulses of light propagateThe cladding, which provides for total internal reflection and containment of the 
light beam within the core
The coating, which protects the core and cladding from damage

An awareness of environmental and societal issues 
is important for the engineer because, over time, greater demands are being made on the world’s natural resources. Furthermore, levels of pollution 
are ever  increasing. Materials engineering decisions have impacts on the consumption of raw materials and energy, on the contamination of our water and atmosphere, on human health, on global climate change, and on the ability of the consumer to recycle or dispose of spent products. The quality of life for this and future generations depends, to some degree, on 
how these issues are  addressed by the global engineering community.WHY STUDY Environmental and Societal Issues in Materials Science and 
Engineering?
In previous chapters, we dealt with a variety of materials science and materials engineer-
ing issues, including criteria that may be used in the materials selection process. Many of these selection criteria relate to material properties or property combinations— mechanical, electrical, thermal, corrosion, and so on; the performance of some  component depends on the properties of the material from which it is made. Processability or ease of fabrication of the component may also play a role in the  selection process. Virtually all of this book, in one way or another, has addressed these property and fabrication issues. In engineering practice, other important criteria must be considered in the develop-ment of a marketable product. Some of these involve environmental and societal issues such as pollution, disposal, recycling, toxicity, and energy. This final chapter offers a rela-tively brief overview of environmental and societal considerations that are important in engineering practice.22.1 INTRODUCTIONLearning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you should be able to do the following:
1.  Diagram the total materials cycle and briefly 
discuss relevant issues that pertain to each stage 
of this cycle.
2.  List the two inputs and five outputs for the life 
cycle analysis/assessment scheme.3.  Cite issues that are relevant to the “green 
design” philosophy of product design.
4.  Discuss recyclability/disposability issues relative 
to (a) metals, (b) glass, (c) plastics and rubber, and (d) composite materials.
Modern technologies and the manufacturing of their associated products affect society 
in a variety of ways—some are positive, others are adverse. Furthermore, these impacts are economic and environmental in type and international in scope inasmuch as (1) the resources required for a new technology often come from many different countries, (2) the economic prosperity resulting from technological development is global in extent, and (3) environmental impacts may extend beyond the boundaries of a single country. Materials play a crucial role in this technology–economy–environment scheme. A material that is used in some end product and then discarded passes through several stages or phases; these stages are represented in Figure 22.1, which is sometimes termed the total materials cycle or just materials cycle and represents the “cradle-to-grave” life 22.2 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS

circuit of a material. Beginning on the far left side of Figure 22.1, raw materials are 
extracted from their natural earthly habitats by mining, drilling, harvesting, and so on. These raw materials are then purified, refined, and converted into bulk forms such as metals, cements, petroleum, rubber, and fibers. Further synthesis and processing results in products that are what may be termed engineered materials, such as metal alloys,  ceramic powders, glass, plastics, composites, semiconductors, and elastomers. Next, these engineered materials are further shaped, treated, and assembled into products, devices, and appliances that are ready for the consumer—this constitutes the “product design, manufacture, assembly” stage of Figure 22.1. The consumer pur chases these products 
and uses them (the “applications” stage) until they wear out or become obsolete and are discarded. At this time, the product constituents may either be recycled/reused (by which they reenter the materials cycle) or disposed of as waste, normally being  either inciner-ated or dumped as solid waste in municipal landfills—and so they return to the Earth and complete the materials cycle. It has been estimated that worldwide, about 15 billion tons of raw materials are  extracted from the Earth every year; some of these are renewable and some are not. Over time, it is becoming more apparent that the Earth is virtually a closed system relative to its constituent materials and that its resources are finite. In addition, as societies mature and populations increase, the available resources become scarcer, and greater attention must be paid to more effective use of these resources relative to the materials cycle. Energy must be supplied at each cycle stage; in the United States it has been esti-mated that approximately one-half of the energy consumed by manufacturing industries 
goes to produce and fabricate materials. Energy is a resource that, to some degree, is limited in supply, and measures must be taken to conserve and use it more effectively in the production, application, and disposal of materials. Finally, there are interactions with and impacts on the natural environment at all stages of the materials cycle. The condition of the Earth’s atmosphere, water, and land depends to a large extent on how carefully we traverse the materials cycle. Some 
778  •   Chapter 22  /  Environmental and Societal Issues in Materials Science and Engineering
 ecological damage and landscape spoilage undoubtedly result during the extraction of 
raw materials. Pollutants may be generated that are expelled into the air and water during synthesis and processing; in addition, any toxic chemicals that are produced must be disposed of or discarded. The final product, device, or appliance should be designed so that during its lifetime, any impact on the environment is minimal; furthermore, at the end of its life, provision should be made for recycling its component materials, or at least for their disposal with little ecological impact (i.e., it should be biodegradable). Recycling of used products rather than disposing of them as waste is a desirable approach for several reasons. First, using recycled material obviates the need to extract raw materials from the Earth and thus conserves natural resources and eliminates any associated ecological impact from the extraction phase. Second, energy requirements for the refinement and processing of recycled materials are normally less than for their natural counterparts; for example, approximately 28 times as much energy is required to refine natural aluminum ores as to recycle aluminum beverage can scrap. Finally, there is no need to dispose of recycled materials. Thus, the materials cycle (Figure 22.1) is really a system that involves interactions and exchanges among materials, energy, and the environment. Future  engineers, world-wide, must understand the interrelationships among these various stages so as to use the Earth’s resources effectively and minimize adverse ecological  effects on our environment. In many countries, environmental problems and issues are being addressed by the establishment of standards that are mandated by governmental regulatory agencies (e.g., the use of lead in electronic components is being phased out). From an industrial perspective, it becomes incumbent on engineers to propose viable solutions to existing and potential environmental concerns. Correcting any environmental problems associated with manufacturing influences product price. A common misconception is that a more environmentally friendly product or process is inherently more costly than one that is environmentally unfriendly. Engineers who use “out-of-the-box” thinking can generate better and cheaper products/processes. Another consideration relates to how one defines cost; in this regard, it is essential to 
look at the entire life cycle and take into account all relevant factors (including disposal and environmental impact issues). One approach being implemented by industry to improve the environmental  performance of products is termed life cycle analysis/assessment. With this approach to product design, consideration is given to the cradle-to-grave environmental assessment of the product, from material extraction to product manufacture to product use and, finally, to recycling and disposal; sometimes this approach is also labeled green design. One important phase of this approach is to quantify the various inputs (i.e., materials and energy) and out-puts (i.e., wastes) for each phase of the life cycle; this is represented schematically in Figure 22.2. In addition, an assessment is conducted relative to the  impact on both global and local environments in terms of the effects on ecology, human health, and resource reserves. One of the current environmental/economic/societal buzzwords is sustainability. In this context, sustainability represents the ability to maintain an acceptable lifestyle at the present level and into the indefinite future while preserving the environment. This means that over time and as populations increase in size, the Earth’s resources must be used at a rate such that they can be replenished naturally and that emission levels of  pollutants are maintained at acceptable levels. For engineers, this concept of sustainability translates into being responsible for the development of sustainable products. An in-ternationally accepted standard, ISO 14001, has been established to help organizations comply with applicable laws and regulations and address the delicate balance between being profitable and reducing impacts on the environment.

Important stages in the materials cycle where materials science and engineering plays 
a significant role are recycling and disposal. The issues of recyclability and disposabil-ity are important when new materials are being designed and synthesized. During the materials selection process, the ultimate disposition of the materials used should be an important criterion. We conclude this section by discussing briefly several of these re-cyclability/disposability issues. From an environmental perspective, the ideal material should be either  completely recyclable or completely biodegradable. Recyclable means that a material, after 
 completing its life cycle in one component, could be reprocessed, could reenter the materials cycle, and could be reused in another component—a process that could be repeated an indefinite number of times. By completely biodegradable, we mean that, by interactions with the environment (natural chemicals, microorganisms, oxygen, heat, sunlight, etc.), the material deteriorates and returns to virtually the same state in which it existed prior to the initial processing. Engineering materials exhibit varying degrees of recyclability and biodegradability. One significant recycling challenge is the separation of various comingled recycla-ble materials found in multimaterial components—e.g., automobiles, electronics, and appliances. Separation techniques have been devised, most of which involve crushing, shredding, cleaning, and grinding processes designed to produce relatively fine particles. For example, a common source of recyclable materials is the end-of-life automobile. Gigantic pieces of equipment consisting of cranes, conveyor belts, rollers, and ham-mer mills are capable of completing shredding an automobile within about 20 seconds. Furthermore, some rather ingenious techniques have been devised for separating out the various materials from the shredded-particle conglomerates. For example, most ferrous alloys, because they are ferromagnetic, can be removed using magnetic-separation tech-niques. An eddy-current separator (using a strong electromagnet) asserts repulsive forces on and ejects nonferrous alloys from the remaining collection of comingled materials. Items made of low-density materials may be separated from high-density ones  using a gravity table. As the mixed materials move along an inclined platform, a fan blows pressurized air across the platform surface, which lifts the lighter items; vibration of the platform diverts heavy items to one side, lighter items to the other. Still other separation techniques continue the separation processes for the general material types.22.3 RECYCLING ISSUES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
780  •   Chapter 22  /  Environmental and Societal Issues in Materials Science and Engineering
Metals
Most metal alloys (e.g., those with Fe or Cu), to one degree or another experience 
 corrosion and are also biodegradable. However, some metals (e.g., Hg, Pb) are toxic and, when placed in landfills, may present health hazards. Furthermore, whereas alloys of most metals are recyclable, it is not feasible to recycle all alloys of every metal. In ad-dition, the quality of alloys that are recycled tends to diminish with each cycle (i.e., are “down-cycled”). Product designs should allow for the dismantling of components composed of  different alloys. Joining of dissimilar alloys presents contamination problems; for exam-ple, if two similar alloys are to be joined, welding is preferred over bolting or riveting. Coatings (paints, anodized layers, claddings, etc.) may also act as contaminants and render the material nonrecyclable. These examples illustrate why it is so important to consider the entire life cycle of a product at the beginning stages of its design. Aluminum alloys are very corrosion resistant and, therefore, nonbiodegradable. Fortunately, however, they may be recycled; in fact, aluminum is the most important recyclable nonferrous metal. Because aluminum is not easily corroded, it may be totally reclaimed. A low ratio of energy is required to refine recycled aluminum relative to its primary production. In addition, a large number of commercially available alloys have been designed to accommodate impurity contamination. The primary sources of recycled aluminum are used beverage cans and scrapped automobiles.
Glass
The ceramic material consumed by the general public in the greatest quantities is glass, in the form of containers. Glass is a relatively inert material and, as such, does not decompose; thus, it is not biodegradable. A significant proportion of municipal landfills consist of waste glass; this is also true of incinerator residue. Glass is an ideal recyclable material—it can be recycled multiple times without significant depreciation of quality. Waste glass must be sorted by color (e.g., clear, amber, green) and by composition [soda–lime, leaded, and borosilicate (or Pyrex)]
2; this is followed by a washing process 
to remove any contaminants. The next stage involves crushing and grinding the waste glass into small pieces called cullet. Additives may be used to decolor (remove any color 
from) or recolor (change the color of) the cullet. Finally, the cullet can be melted and formed into useful products (e.g., glass containers) or used in other markets to include the following: aggregate in concrete, fiberglass wall insulation, countertops, abrasives, and fluxing agents in bricks (during firing).
Plastics and Rubbers
One reason that synthetic polymers are so popular as engineering materials is their chemical and biological inertness. On the down side, this characteristic is really a liabil-ity when it comes to waste disposal. Most polymers are not biodegradable and, there-fore, do not biodegrade in landfills; major sources of waste are from packaging, junked automobiles, automobile tires, and domestic durable goods. Biodegradable polymers have been synthesized, but they are relatively expensive to produce (see the Materials of Importance box that follows). However, because some polymers are combustible and do not yield appreciable toxic or polluting emissions, they may be disposed of by incineration.
2Heat-resistant glasses such as the borosilicates need to be separated from other types because they (the borosilicates) 
have relatively high melting points and will affect the viscosity of a fluid glass at elevated temperatures (see Figure 13.14).
22.3 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering   •  781
Thermoplastics
 Thermoplastic polymers are amenable to reclamation and recycling because they 
may be re-formed upon heating. In addition to the separation stages noted earlier (i.e., shredding, cleaning, and grinding) it is necessary to sort plastic particles by color and chemistry. Color sorting can be carried out by a photoelectric detector, which identifies particles of a specific color; an air gun then blows away particles of all other colors from the waste stream. One technique for sorting by chemistry uses flotation techniques bor-rowed from the mineral processing industry; plastic materials are also separated from contaminants (e.g., fillers, Section 15.22) using similar techniques. In some countries, type sorting of packaging materials is facilitated by using a num-ber identification code; for example, a 1 denotes poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET or PETE). Table 22.1 presents these recycling code numbers and their associated materials. Also included in the table are uses of virgin and recycled materials.

 A recycled plastic is less costly than the original material, and quality and appear-
ance are typically degraded (i.e., down-cycled) with each recycle.
Rubbers
 Rubber materials present disposal and recycling challenges. When vulcanized, they are thermoset materials, which makes chemical recycling difficult. In addition, they may also contain a variety of fillers. The major source of rubber scrap in the United States is discarded automobile tires, which are highly nonbiodegradable. Disposal in landfills is normally not a viable option because they are bulky and buoyant (float when immersed in water); furthermore, fires that start in mounds of discarded tires are extremely dif-ficult to extinguish. In spite of these challenges, a high proportion of discarded tires in the United States are being recycled into useful and innovative products. Recycling begins by shredding the tires into chunks approximately 20 mm (3/4 in.) in size. At this point steel reinforce-ment wire is separated from the flow stream using magnets and then sold as scrap. The rubber chunks are further reduced in size to form “crumb rubber” particles, which may be as small as 600 µm. Applications for recycled tires include the following:
 • Rubberized asphalt highway-paving material—contains 15 to 22 percent crumb 
rubber, costs less, is longer lasting, and provides a smoother and quieter ride.
 • Sports field surfaces (football, running tracks, and equestrian)—improves cushion-
ing and springiness, reduces presence of mud and dust, surfaces dry quickly, and there is less freezing damage
 • Rubber mulch for landscapes and play areas—long-lasting and does not attract termites.
 • Flip-flop sandals • Fuel for some industrial applications (e.g., cement plants, power plants, and mills)
 • Also used in welcome mats, portable speed bumps, and railroad ties
 The most viable recyclable alternatives to traditional rubber materials are thermo-
plastic elastomers (Section 15.20). Being thermoplastic in nature, they are not chemically crosslinked and, thus, are easily reshaped. Furthermore, production energy requirements are lower than for the thermoset rubbers because a vulcanization step is not required in their manufacture.
Composite Materials
Composites are inherently difficult to recycle because they are multiphase. The two or more phases/materials that constitute the composite are normally intermixed on a very fine scale, and trying to separate them during recycling is a difficult process. Most recycling techniques that have been developed are for polymer-matrix fiber-reinforced composites composed of glass and carbon fibers. The polymer matrix phase may be either a thermoplastic (which softens when heated and hardens when cooled) or a thermoset (which, after hardening, will not soften when heated). Three types of recy-cling processes may be used for both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices, as follows:
 • Mechanical—the composite material is reduced to small particles using shredding/
grinding/milling techniques. The powdered recyclate may then be incorporated into another composite to function as a filler or as a reinforcement phase.
22.3 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering   •  783
 • Thermal—fibers are recovered from the matrix by heat-treating the composite; for 
some techniques the matrix is vaporized. Thus, the objective of thermal recycling 
is to obtain high-quality fibers that may be reused. Recovered fibers will have short lengths and their properties may be depreciated. In addition, useful heat energy may be  generated.
 • Chemical—separation of fibers and matrix is accomplished by a chemical reaction; 
fiber recovery is the primary goal. The matrix may be converted into other  substances, which may be hazardous and require further processing.
Both thermal and chemical techniques may also be preceded by mechanical treatments. Composites having thermoplastic matrices may be remolded without having to be shredded or ground into small particles. On the other hand, powdered thermoplastic-matrix recyclates also may be formed by molding. Molding is not possible for thermoset-matrix fiber-reinforced composites. Two general forms of recycling make use of these materials: (1) Fibers that have been  extracted from these materials (thermally or chemically) may be recycled—that is, reused as reinforcing materials in other applications; and (2) Powdered recyclates may be used as constituents (i.e., fillers and replacement reinforcements) in new composites. Recycled fiberglass composites are used in the following applications: artificial wood materials; concrete floors, curbs, and sidewalks (to decrease shrinkage and in-crease durability); asphalt; roofing tar; and cast countertops. Applications for recycled carbon-fiber reinforced composites include the following: electromagnetic shielding, antistatic paints and coatings, high-temperature insulation, composite tooling, and molded components for automobiles.
Electronic Waste (e-Waste)
The advent of our modern electronic devices has created another type of waste— electronic waste, or e-waste that needs to be disposed of (landfilled or incinerated) or recycled. Obsolete, outdated, discarded, and broken electronic devices (e.g., computers, laptops, cell phones, tablets, televisions, monitors, printers) all become a part of this electronic waste stream. The rapid expansion of technology and ever-increasing appetite for new, better, and cheaper electronic gadgets has resulted in the generation of e-waste at a staggering rate. A large number and wide variety of materials are found in e-waste. Some of these are hazardous and/or toxic and should be prevented from entering the soil, ground-water, and atmosphere; major ones include the following: lead, cadmium, chromium, mercury, brominated flame retardants (BFRs added to polymers), and beryllium oxide. Nonhazardous materials include copper, aluminum, gold, iron, palladium, tin, epoxy resins, poly(vinyl chloride), and fiberglass. Some materials of both types are amenable to recycling. Unfortunately, few and very little of these materials are recycled. Often, electronic waste sent to recyclers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe is exported to developing coun-tries. Here the waste is processed in environments that are virtually unregulated, using primitive technologies (e.g., melting circuit boards, burning cable sheathing, and sepa-rating metals that can be recycled using open-pit leaching). Toxic substances generated using these techniques pose serious health risks to recyclers. In addition, much of this e-waste containing toxic materials is either burned or dumped in landfills, which leads to environmental contamination that is very hazardous to local residents.

Biodegradable and Biorenewable Polymers/PlasticsMATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 2 2 . 1
Most polymers manufactured today are synthetic 
and petroleum based. These synthetic materials 
(e.g., polyethylene, polystyrene) are extremely stable and resistant to degradation, particularly in moist environments. In the 1970s and 1980s it was feared that the large volume of plastic waste being generated would contribute to the filling of all available landfill capacity. Thus, the resistance to degradation of poly-mers was viewed as a liability rather than as an asset. The introduction of biodegradable polymers was perceived as a means to eliminate some of this landfill waste, and the response of the polymer industry was to start developing biodegradable materials. Biodegradable polymers are those that degrade naturally in the environment, normally by microbial action. With regard to degradation mechanism, mi-crobes sever polymer chain bonds, which leads to a decrease in molecular size; these smaller molecules may then be ingested by microbes in a process that is similar to the composting of plants. Of course, natural polymers such as wool, cotton, and wood are bio-degradable inasmuch as microbes can readily digest these materials. The first generation of these degradable  materials was based on common polymers such as polyethylene. Compounds were added to make these materials decompose in sunlight (i.e., photodegrade), to oxidize by reacting with oxygen in the air, and/or to degrade biologically. Unfortunately, this first generation did not measure up to expectations. They degraded slowly (if at all) and the anticipated reduc-tion in landfill waste was not realized. These initial disappointments gave degradable polymers a bad reputation that hindered their development. By way of response, the polymer industry instituted standards that measure degradation rate accurately and charac-terize the mode of degradation. These developments led to a renewed interest in biodegradable polymers. Development of the current generation of 
 biodegradable polymers is frequently directed to niche  applications that take advantage of their short lifetimes. For example, biodegradable leaf and yard waste bags can be used to contain compostable matter, which eliminates the need to debag the material. Another important application of biodegradable plastics is as mulch films for farming (Figure 22.3). In colder regions of the world, covering seedbeds with plastic sheets can extend the growing season so as to increase crop yields and, in addition, reduce costs. The plastic sheets absorb heat, raise the ground tempera-ture, and increase moisture retention. Traditionally, black polyethylene (nonbiodegradable) sheets were 
used. However, at the end of the growing season, these sheets had to be gathered from the field and dis-posed of manually because they did not  decompose/biodegrade. More recently, biodegradable plastics have been developed for use as mulch films. After the crops have been harvested, these films are simply plowed into and enrich the soil as they decompose. Other potential opportunities for this group of materials exist in the fast food industry. For example, if all plates, cups, packaging, and so on were based on biodegradable materials, they could be commingled with food waste and then composted in large-scale operations. Not only would these measures reduce the amount of material entering landfills, but if the polymers were derived from renewable materials, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would result. In order to reduce our dependence on petroleum and the emissions of greenhouse gases, there has been a major effort to develop biodegradable polymers 
that are also biorenewable —based on  plant-derived 
materials (biomass
3). These new materials must be Figure 22.3  Biodegradable plastic mulch films that

cost-competitive with existing polymers and capable 
of being processed using conventional techniques (extrusion, injection molding, etc.). Over the past 30 or so years, a number of bio-renewable polymers have been synthesized that have properties comparable to those of petroleum-derived materials; some are biodegradable, and others are not. Perhaps the best known of these bioderived polymers is poly(l-lactic acid) (abbreviated PLA), which has 
the following repeat unit structure: elevated temperatures generated in commer cial compost-
ing facilities. At room temper ature and normal  ambient 
conditions, it is stable indefinitely . The  degradation 
products consist of water, carbon  dioxide, and organic matter. In its initial stages, the degradation process in which a high-molecular-weight polymer is broken into smaller pieces is not truly one of “biodegradation” as described earlier; rather, it involves hydrolytic cleav-age of the polymer backbone chain, and there is little or no evidence of microbial action. However, the sub-sequent degradation of these lower-molecular-weight fragments is microbial. Poly(lactic acid) is also recyclable—with the right equipment, it can be converted back into the original monomer and then resynthesized to form PLA. A number of other characteristics of PLA make it an especially attractive material, in particular for textile applications. For example, it may be spun into fibers using conventional melt-spinning processes (Section 15.25). In addition, PLA has excellent crimp and crimp retention, is resistant to degradation when exposed to ultraviolet light (i.e., resists fading), and is relatively nonflammable. Other potential applica-tions for this material include household furnishings such as drapes, upholstery, and awnings, as well as diapers and industrial wipes.

industrial feedstock.nO

Commercially, PLA is derived from lactic acid; how-ever, the raw materials for its manufacture are starch-rich renewable products such as corn, sugar beets, and wheat. Mechanically, the modulus of elasticity and ten-sile strength of PLA are comparable to poly(ethylene terephthalate), and copolymerization with other bio-degradable polymers [e.g., poly(glycolic acid) (PGA)] promotes property alterations to allow the use of conventional manufacturing processes such as injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, and fiber forming. Other properties make PLA desirable as a packaging material, especially for beverages and food products—transparency, resistance to attack by moisture and grease, odorlessness, and odor-barrier characteristics. PLA is also bioresorbable, meaning that it is assimilated (or absorbed) in biological systems—for example the human body. Hence, it has been used in a variety of biomedical applications, including resorbable sutures, implants, and controlled release of drugs. The primary obstacle to the widespread use of PLA and other biodegradable polymers has been that of high cost, a common problem associated with the introduc-tion of new materials. However, the development of more efficient and economical synthesis and processing techniques has resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of this class of materials, making them more com-petitive with conventional petroleum-based polymers. Although PLA is biodegradable, it degrades only under carefully controlled circumstances—that is, at

SUMMARY
• Environmental and societal impacts of production are becoming significant engineering 
issues. In this regard, the material cradle-to-grave life cycle is an important consideration.
• The cradle-to-grave cycle consists of extraction, synthesis/processing, product design/
manufacture, application, and disposal stages (Figure 22.1).
• Efficient operation of the materials cycle is facilitated using an input/output inventory 
for the life-cycle assessment of a product. Materials and energy are the input parameters, 
whereas outputs include usable products, water effluents, air emissions, and solid wastes (Figure 22.2).
• The Earth is a closed system, in that its materials resources are finite; to some degree, 
the same may be said of energy resources. Environmental issues involve ecological damage, pollution, and waste disposal.
• Recycling of used products and the use of green design obviate some of these environ-
mental problems.Environmental 
and Societal 
Considerations
Recycling Issues in 
Materials Science 
and Engineering• Recyclability and disposability issues are important in the context of materials science 
and engineering. Ideally, a material should be at best recyclable, and at least biode-gradable or disposable.
• Techniques have been devised to separate comingled recyclable materials in multima-
terial components.
• With regard to the recyclability/disposability of the various material types:
Among metal alloys there are varying degrees of recyclability and biodegradabil-
ity (i.e., susceptibility to corrosion). Some metals are toxic and, therefore, not disposable.
Glass is the most common commercial ceramic. It is not biodegradable; however, 
recycling into a number of commercial products is possible.
Most plastics and rubber are nonbiodegradable. Thermoplastic polymers are re-
cyclable; however, recycling of thermosetting polymers and rubber materials is challenging. Shredded rubber scrap automobile tires are recycled into a number of innovative products.
Composite materials are difficult to recycle because they are composed of two 
or more phases that are normally intermixed on a fine scale. Some composites are ground up into small particles, which are used as fillers in other composites. Thermal and chemical techniques have been devised to separate some fiber–matrix combinations.
• Electronic waste from obsolete, outdated, and discarded electronic products is now 
being generated at a staggering and ever-increasing rate. Some e-waste materials are hazardous and/or toxic and should not be landfilled or incinerated. Other nonhazard-ous materials are amenable to recycling.

CHAPTER 5 QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
Introduction
5.1 Briefly explain the difference between self-
diffusion and interdiffusion.
5.2 Self-diffusion involves the motion of atoms that 
are all of the same type; therefore it is not subject 
to observation by compositional changes, as with interdiffusion. Suggest one way in which self-diffusion may be monitored.

mechanisms for diffusion.
 (b) Cite two reasons why interstitial diffusion is

 applies to diffusion.
5.7 (a) Briefly explain the concept of a driving force.
 (b) What is the driving force for steady-state 
 diffusion?
5.8 The purification of hydrogen gas by diffusion 
through a palladium sheet was discussed in Section 5.3. Compute the number of kilograms of hydrogen that pass per hour through a 5-mm-thick sheet of palladium having an area of 0.20 m
2 
at 500 °C. Assume a diffusion coefficient of 1.0 × 
10−8 m2/s, that the concentrations at the high- and 
low-pressure sides of the plate are 2.4 and 0.6 kg of  hydrogen per cubic meter of palladium, and that steady-state conditions have been attained.
5.9 A sheet of steel 1.5 mm thick has nitrogen 
 atmospheres on both sides at 1200 °C and is 
SS permitted to achieve a steady-state diffusion con-dition. The diffusion coefficient for nitrogen in steel at this temperature is 6 × 10
−11 m2/s, and the 
diffusion flux is found to be 1.2 × 10−7 kg/m2·s. 
Also, it is known that the concentration of nitrogen in the steel at the high-pressure surface is 4 kg/m
3. 
How far into the sheet from this high-pressure side will the concentration be 2.0 kg/m
3? Assume a lin-
ear concentration profile.
5.10 A sheet of BCC iron 1 mm thick was exposed 
to a carburizing gas atmosphere on one side and a decarburizing atmosphere on the other side at 725° C. After having reached steady state, the iron 
was quickly cooled to room temperature. The carbon concentrations at the two surfaces of the sheet were determined to be 0.012 and 0.0075 wt%. Compute the diffusion coefficient if the diffusion flux is 1.4 × 10
−8 kg/m2·s. Hint: Use Equation 4.9 to 
convert the concentrations from weight percent to kilograms of carbon per cubic meter of iron.
5.11 When 𝛼-iron is subjected to an atmosphere of 
hydrogen gas, the concentration of hydrogen in the iron, C
H (in weight percent), is a function of 
hydrogen pressure, PH2 (in MPa), and absolute 
temperature (T) according to
CH=1.34 ×10−2√pH2 exp(−27.2 kJ ∕mol

  Furthermore, the values of D0 and Qd for this dif-
fusion system are 1.4 × 10−7 m2/s and 13,400 J/mol, 
respectively. Consider a thin iron membrane 1 mm thick that is at 250 °C. Compute the diffu-
sion flux through this membrane if the hydrogen pressure on one side of the membrane is 0.15 MPa (1.48  atm), and on the other side 7.5  MPa (74 atm).

achieve a carbon concentration of 0.45 wt% at 
a position 2 mm into an iron–carbon alloy that initially contains 0.20 wt% C. The surface concen-tration is to be maintained at 1.30 wt% C, and the treatment is to be conducted at 1000 °C. Use the 
diffusion data for 𝛾-Fe in Table 5.2.
5.14 An FCC iron–carbon alloy initially containing 
0.35 wt% C is exposed to an oxygen-rich and virtu-ally carbon-free atmosphere at 1400 K (1127 °C). 
Under these circumstances the carbon diffuses from the alloy and reacts at the surface with the oxygen in the atmosphere; that is, the carbon concentration at the  surface position is maintained essentially at 0 wt% C. (This process of carbon depletion is termed decarburization.) At what position will the 
carbon concentration be 0.15 wt% after a 10-h treat-ment? The value of D  at 1400 K is 6.9 × 10
−11 m2/s.
5.15 Nitrogen from a gaseous phase is to be diffused 
into pure iron at 700 °C. If the surface concentra-
tion is maintained at 0.1 wt% N, what will be the concentration 1 mm from the surface after 10 h? The diffusion coefficient for nitrogen in iron at 700°C is 2.5 × 10
−11 m2/s.
5.16 Consider a diffusion couple composed of two 
semi-infinite solids of the same metal, and that each side of the diffusion couple has a different concentration of the same elemental impurity; assume each impurity level is constant throughout its side of the diffusion couple. For this situation, the solution to Fick’s second law (assuming that the diffusion coefficient for the impurity is inde-pendent of concentration), is as follows:
C
x=C2+(C1−C2

2√Dt)] (5.15)
  The schematic diffusion profile in Figure 5.12 
shows these concentration parameters as well as concentration profiles at times t = 0 and t  > 0. 
Please note that at t = 0, the x = 0 position is taken 
as the initial diffusion couple interface, whereas C
1 
is the impurity concentration for x  < 0, and C2 is 
the impurity content for x  > 0.

carburizing heat treatment of 10-h duration will raise the carbon concentration to 0.45 wt% at a point 2.5 mm from the surface. Estimate the time necessary to achieve the same concentration at a 5.0-mm position for an identical steel and at the same carburizing temperature.

DESIGN PROBLEMS
Fick’s First Law
 5.D1 It is desired to enrich the partial pressure of 
hydrogen in a hydrogen–nitrogen gas mixture for 
which the partial pressures of both gases are 0.1013 MPa (1 atm). It has been proposed to accomplish this by passing both gases through a thin sheet of some metal at an  elevated  temperature; inasmuch as hydrogen diffuses through the plate at a higher rate than does nitrogen, the partial pressure of  hydrogen will be higher on the exit side of the sheet. The design calls for partial pressures of 0.0709 MPa (0.7 atm) and 0.02026 MPa (0.2 atm), respectively, for hydrogen and nitrogen. The concentrations of hydrogen and  nitrogen (C
H and CN, in mol/m3) in 
this metal are functions of gas partial pressures ( pH2 
and pN2, in MPa) and absolute temperature and are 
given by the following expressions:

6.13 In Section 2.6 it was noted that the net bonding en-
ergy EN between two isolated positive and negative 
ions is a function of interionic distance r  as follows:
 EN=−A
r+B
rn (6.31)
  where A, B, and n  are constants for the particu-
lar ion pair. Equation 6.31 is also valid for the bonding energy between adjacent ions in solid materials. The modulus of elasticity E  is pro-
portional to the slope of the interionic force-separation curve at the equilibrium interionic separation; that is,
E∝(dF
dr)r0
  Derive an expression for the dependence of the 
modulus of elasticity on these A, B, and n param-
eters (for the two-ion system) using the following procedure:
 1. Establish a relationship for the force F as a 
function of r, realizing that
F=dE
N
dr
 2. Now take the derivative dF/dr.
 3. Develop an expression for r0, the equilibrium 
separation. Because r0 corresponds to the value 
of r at the minimum of the EN-versus-r  curve 
(Figure  2.10b ), take the derivative dEN/dr, set it 
equal to zero, and solve for r , which corresponds 
to r0.
 4. Finally, substitute this expression for r0 into the 
relationship obtained by taking dF/dr.

nitudes of the moduli of elasticity for the following hypothetical X, Y, and Z materials from the great-est to the least. The appropriate A , B, and n  param-

6.42 A tensile test is performed on a metal specimen, 
and it is found that a true plastic strain of 0.20 is 
produced when a true stress of 575 MPa (83,500 psi) is applied; for the same metal, the value of K in 
Equation 6.19 is 860 MPa (125,000 psi). Calculate the true strain that results from the application of a true stress of 600 MPa (87,000 psi).
6.43 For some metal alloy, a true stress of 415 MPa 
(60,175 psi) produces a plastic true strain of 0.475. How much does a specimen of this material elongate when a true stress of 325 MPa (46,125 psi) is applied if the original length is 300 mm (11.8 in.)? Assume a value of 0.25 for the strain-hardening exponent n .
6.44 The following true stresses produce the corre-
sponding true plastic strains for a brass alloy:

 60,000 0.20
  What true stress is necessary to produce a true 
plastic strain of 0.25?
6.45 For a brass alloy, the following engineering 
stresses produce the corresponding plastic engi-
neering strains, prior to necking:

  On the basis of this information, compute the 
engineering stress necessary to produce an engi-neering strain of 0.25.
6.46 Find the toughness (or energy to cause fracture) 
for a metal that experiences both elastic and plas-tic deformation. Assume Equation 6.5 for elastic deformation, that the modulus of elasticity is 172 GPa (25 × 10
6 psi), and that elastic deformation 
terminates at a strain of 0.01. For plastic deforma-tion, assume that the relationship between stress and strain is described by Equation 6.19, in which the values for K and n  are 6900 MPa (1 ×  10

and 0.75, at which point fracture occurs.
6.47 For a tensile test, it can be demonstrated that 
necking begins when
 d𝜎T
d𝜀T=𝜎T (6.32)
  Using Equation 6.19, determine an expression for 
the value of true strain at this onset of necking.
6.48 Taking the logarithm of both sides of Equation 
6.19 yields
 log 𝜎T=log K+n log 𝜀T (6.33)
  Thus, a plot of log 𝜎T versus log 𝜀T in the plastic re-
gion to the point of necking should yield a straight line having a slope of n  and an intercept (at log 𝜎
T = 0) 
of log K.
   Using the appropriate data tabulated in 
Problem 6.29, make a plot of log 𝜎T versus log 𝜀T 
and determine the values of n and K. It will be 
necessary to convert engineering stresses and strains to true stresses and strains using Equations 6.18a and 6.18b.

CHAPTER 7 QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
Basic Concepts
Characteristics of Dislocations
7.1 To provide some perspective on the dimensions 
of atomic defects, consider a metal specimen 
with a dislocation density of 104 mm−2. Suppose 
that all the dislocations in 1000 mm3 (1 cm3) were 
somehow removed and linked end to end. How far (in miles) would this chain extend? Now sup-pose that the density is increased to 10
10 mm−2 by 
cold working. What would be the chain length of dislocations in 1000 mm
3 of material?
7.2 Consider two edge dislocations of opposite sign 
and having slip planes separated by several atomic distances, as indicated in the following diagram. Briefly describe the defect that results when these two dislocations become aligned with each other.

sign to annihilate each other? Explain your answer.

7.13 A single crystal of aluminum is oriented for a 
tensile test such that its slip plane normal makes an angle of 28.1 ° with the tensile axis. Three pos-
sible slip directions make angles of 62.4 °, 72.0°, 
and 81.1 ° with the same tensile axis.

favored?
 (b) If plastic deformation begins at a tensile stress 
of 1.95 MPa (280 psi), determine the critical re-solved shear stress for aluminum.

direction, and is initiated at an applied tensile stress of 1.1 MPa (160 psi), compute the critical resolved shear stress.
7.15 A single crystal of a metal that has the FCC crys-
tal structure is oriented such that a tensile stress is applied parallel to the [110] direction. If the critical resolved shear stress for this material is 1.75 MPa, calculate the magnitude(s) of applied stress(es) necessary to cause slip to occur on the (111) plane in each of the [1 1
0], [10 1 ] and [01 1 ] directions.

of the (110) and (101) planes.

values, which slip system(s) is (are) most favora-bly oriented?
7.17 Consider a single crystal of some hypothetical 
metal that has the FCC crystal structure and is ori-ented such that a tensile stress is applied along a

in a [1 01] direction, compute the stress at which 
the crystal yields if its critical resolved shear stress is 3.42 MPa.

27 MPa (4000 psi). Determine the maximum pos-sible yield strength for a single crystal of Fe pulled

CHAPTER 10 QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
The Kinetics of Phase Transformations
10.1 Name the two stages involved in the formation 
of particles of a new phase. Briefly describe each.
10.2 (a) Rewrite the expression for the total free en-
ergy change for nucleation (Equation 10.1) for the case of a cubic nucleus of edge length a  (instead 
of a sphere of radius r). Now differentiate this expression with respect to a (per Equation 10.2) 
and solve for both the critical cube edge length, a*, and also ΔG*.
 (b) Is ΔG* greater for a cube or a sphere? Why?
10.3 If copper (which has a melting point of 1085
°C) 
homogeneously nucleates at 849 °C, calculate the 
critical radius given values of −1.77 × 109 J/m3 
and 0.200 J/m2, respectively, for the latent heat of 
 fusion and the surface free energy.
10.4 (a) For the solidification of iron, calculate the 
critical radius r* and the activation free energy 
ΔG* if nucleation is homogeneous. Values for the 
latent heat of fusion and surface free energy are 
−1.85 × 109 J/m3 and 0.204 J/m2, respectively. Use 
the supercooling value found in Table 10.1.
 (b) Now calculate the number of atoms found 
in a nucleus of critical size. Assume a lattice pa-
rameter of 0.292 nm for solid iron at its melting temperature.
10.5 (a) Assume for the solidification of iron 
(Problem 10.4) that nucleation is homogeneous, and the number of stable nuclei is 10
6 nuclei per 
cubic meter. Calculate the critical radius and the SS
number of stable nuclei that exist at the following degrees of supercooling: 200 K and 300 K.
 (b) What is significant about the magnitudes of 
these critical radii and the numbers of stable nuclei?
10.6 For some transformation having kinetics that 
obey the Avrami equation (Equation 10.17), the parameter n is known to have a value of 1.7. If, 
after 100 s, the reaction is 50% complete, how long (total time) will it take the transformation to go to 99% completion?
10.7 Compute the rate of some reaction that obeys 
Avrami kinetics, assuming that the constants n and 
k have values of 3.0 and 7 × 10
–3, respect ively, for 
time expressed in seconds.
10.8 It is known that the kinetics of recrystallization 
for some alloy obey the Avrami equation and that the value of n in the exponential is 2.5. If, at some temperature, the fraction recrystallized is 0.40 after 200 min, determine the rate of recrystallization at this temperature.
10.9 It is known that the kinetics of some transforma-
tion obeys the Avrami equation and that the value of k is 6.0 × 10
−8 (for time in minutes). If the frac-
tion transformed is 0.75 after 200 min, determine the rate of this transformation.
10.10 The kinetics of the austenite-to-pearlite trans-
formation obey the Avrami relationship. Using the fraction transformed–time data given here, determine the total time required for 95% of the austenite to transform to pearlite:

Conduction in Ionic Materials

in FeO (wüstite), the iron ions can exist in both Fe
2+ and Fe3+ states. The number of each of these 
ion types depends on temperature and the ambi-ent oxygen pressure. Furthermore, we also note that in order to retain electroneutrality, one Fe
2+ 
vacancy will be created for every two Fe3+ ions 
that are formed; consequently, in order to reflect the existence of these vacancies the formula for wüstite is often represented as Fe
(1−x)O, where x 
is some small fraction less than unity.
In this nonstoichiometric Fe(1−x)O material, 
conduction is electronic, and, in fact, it behaves as a p-type semiconductor—that is, the Fe
3+ ions act 
as electron acceptors, and it is relatively easy to excite an electron from the valence band into an Fe
3+ acceptor state, with the formation of a hole.

  •  A-1Appendix A   The International System 
of Units (SI)
U nits in the International System of Units fall into two classifications: base and derived. 
Base units are fundamental and not reducible. Table A.1 lists the base units of interest in the 
discipline of materials science and engineering. Derived units are expressed in terms of the base units, using mathematical signs for multiplication and division. For example, the SI units for density are kilogram per cubic me-ter (kg/m
3). For some derived units, special names and symbols exist; for example, N is used 
to denote the newton—the unit of force—which is equivalent to 1 kg ∙m/s2. Table A.2 lists a 
number of important derived units. It is sometimes necessary, or convenient, to form names and symbols that are decimal multiples or submultiples of SI units. Only one prefix is used when a multiple of an SI unit is formed, which should be in the numerator. These prefixes and their approved symbols are given in Table A.3.

A-32  •  Appendix C  /  Costs and Relative Costs for Selected Engineering Materials
This appendix contains price information for the set of materials for which Appendix B 
gives the properties. The collection of valid cost data for materials is an extremely difficult 
task, which explains the dearth of materials pricing information in the literature. One reason for this is that there are three pricing tiers: manufacturer, distributor, and retail. Under most circumstances, we cite distributor prices. For some materials (e.g., specialized ceramics, such as silicon carbide and silicon nitride), it is necessary to use manufacturer’s prices. In addition, there may be significant variation in the cost for a specific material. There are several reasons for this. First, each vendor has its own pricing scheme. Furthermore, cost depends on quan-tity of material purchased and, in addition, how it was processed or treated. We endeavored to collect data for relatively large orders—that is, quantities on the order of 900 kg (2000 lb
m) 
for materials that are typically sold in bulk lots—and, also, for common shapes/treatments. When possible, we obtained price quotes from at least three distributors/manufacturers. This pricing information was collected in January 2015. Cost data are in U.S. dollars per kilogram; in addition, these data are expressed as both price ranges and single-price values. The absence of a price range (i.e., when a single value is cited) means that either the variation is small, or that, on the basis of limited data, it is not possible to identify a range of prices. Furthermore, inasmuch as material prices change over time, it was decided to use a relative cost index; this index represents the per-unit-mass cost (or average per-unit-mass cost) of a material divided by the average per-unit mass cost of a common engineering material—A36 plain carbon steel. Although the price of a specific material varies over time, the price ratio between that material and another will, most likely, change more slowly.Appendix  C   Costs and Relative Costs for
