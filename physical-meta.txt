R. J. Bishop
After working in laboratories of the automobile,forging, tube-drawing and razor blade industries(1944–59), Ray Bishop became a Principal Scientistof the British Coal Utilization Research Association(1959–68), studying superheater-tube corrosion andmechanisms of ash deposition on behalf of boilermanufacturers and the Central Electricity GeneratingBoard. He specialized in combustor simulation ofconditions within pulverized-fuel-ﬁred power stationboilers and ﬂuidized-bed combustion systems. He thenbecame a Senior Lecturer in Materials Science atthe Polytechnic (now University), Wolverhampton,acting at various times as leader of C&G, HNC, TECand CNAA honours Degree courses and supervisingdoctoral researches. For seven years he was OpenUniversity Tutor for materials science and processingin the West Midlands. In 1986 he joined theSchool of Metallurgy and Materials, University ofBirmingham as a part-time Lecturer and was involvedin administration of the Federation of EuropeanMaterials Societies (FEMS). In 1995 and 1997 hegave lecture courses in materials science at the Naval
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Currently
he is an Honorary Lecturer at the University ofBirmingham.

Preface
It is less than ﬁve years since the last edition of
Modern Physical Metallurgy was enlarged to include
the related subject of Materials Science and Engi-
neering, appearing under the title Metals and Mate-
rials: Science, Processes, Applications . In its revised
approach, it covered a wider range of metals andalloys and included ceramics and glasses, polymers
and composites, modern alloys and surface engineer-
ing. Each of these additional subject areas was treated
on an individual basis as well as against unifying
background theories of structure, kinetics and phasetransformations, defects and materials characteriza-
tion.
In the relatively short period of time since that
previous edition, there have been notable advances
in the materials science and engineering of biomat-erials and sports equipment. Two new chapters have
now been devoted to these topics. The subject of
biomaterials concerns the science and application ofmaterials that must function effectively and reliably
whilst in contact with living tissue; these vital mat-
erialsfeature increasinglyinmodern surgery,medicine
and dentistry. Materials developed for sports equip-
ment must take into account the demands peculiarto each sport. In the process of writing these addi-
tional chapters, we became increasingly conscious
that engineering aspects of the book were coming
more and more into prominence. A new form of
title was deemed appropriate. Finally, we decidedto combine the phrase ‘physical metallurgy’, which
expresses a sense of continuity with earlier edi-
tions, directly with ‘materials engineering’ in the
book’s title.Overall, as in the previous edition, the book aims to
present the science of materials in a relatively concise
form and to lead naturally into an explanation of the
ways in which various important materials are pro-
cessedandapplied.Wehavesoughttoprovideauseful
surveyofkeymaterialsandtheirinterrelations,empha-sizing, wherever possible,the underlyingscientiﬁc and
engineering principles. Throughout we have indicated
the manner in which powerful tools of characteriza-tion, such as optical and electron microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, etc. are used to elucidate the vital relations
between the structure of a material and its mechani-cal, physicaland/orchemical properties.Control of the
microstructure/property relation recurs as a vital theme
during the actual processing of metals, ceramics and
polymers;productionproceduresforostensiblydissim-
ilar materials frequently share common principles.
We have continued to try and make the subject
area accessible to a wide range of readers. Sufﬁcient
background and theory is provided to assist studentsin answering questions over a large part of a typical
Degree course in materials science and engineering.
Some sections provide a background or point of entryfor research studies at postgraduate level. For the more
general reader, the book should serve as a useful
introduction or occasional reference on the myriad
ways in which materials are utilized. We hope that
we have succeeded in conveying the excitement ofthe atmosphere in which a life-altering range of new
materials is being conceived and developed.

The structure and bonding of atoms
1.1 The realm of materials science
In everyday life we encounter a remarkable range of
engineering materials: metals, plastics and ceramics
are some of the generic terms that we use to describe
them. The size of the artefact may be extremely small,as in the silicon microchip, or large, as in the welded
steel plate construction of a suspension bridge. We
acknowledge that these diverse materials are quite lit-
erally the stuff of our civilization and have a deter-
mining effect upon its character, just as cast iron did
during the Industrial Revolution. The ways in which
we use, or misuse, materials will obviously also inﬂu-
ence its future. We should recognize that the pressing
and interrelated global problems of energy utilization
and environmental control each has a substantial and
inescapable ‘materials dimension’.
The engineer is primarily concerned with the func-
tion of the component or structure, frequently with
its capacity to transmit working stresses without risk
of failure. The secondary task, the actual choice
of a suitable material, requires that the materials
scientist should provide the necessary design data,
synthesize and develop new materials, analyse fail-
ures and ultimately produce material with the desired
shape, form and properties at acceptable cost. This
essential collaboration between practitioners of the
two disciplines is sometimes expressed in the phrase‘Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)’. So far
as the main classes of available materials are con-
cerned, it is initially useful to refer to the type of
diagram shown in Figure 1.1. The principal sectors
represent metals, ceramics and polymers. All these
materials can now be produced in non-crystalline
forms, hence a glassy ‘core’ is shown in the diagram.
Combining two or more materials of very different
properties, a centuries-old device, produces importantcomposite materials: carbon-ﬁbre-reinforced polymers
(CFRP)andmetal-matrixcomposites(MMC)aremod-
ern examples.
Figure 1.1 The principal classes of materials (after Rice,
1983).
Adjectives describing the macroscopic behaviour of
materials naturally feature prominently in any lan-
guage. We write and speak of materials being hard,
strong, brittle, malleable, magnetic, wear-resistant, etc.Despite their apparent simplicity, such terms have
depths of complexity when subjected to scientiﬁc
scrutiny, particularly when attempts are made to relatea given property to the internal structure of a material.In practice, the search for bridges of understanding
between macroscopic and microscopic behaviour is a
central and recurrent theme of materials science. ThusSorby’s metallurgical studies of the structure/property
relations for commercial irons and steel in the late
nineteenth century are often regarded as the beginningof modern materials science. In more recent times, theenhancement of analytical techniques for characteriz-
ing structures in ﬁne detail has led to the development
and acceptance of polymers and ceramics as trustwor-thy engineering materials.
2Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Having outlined the place of materials science in
our highly material-dependent civilization, it is now
appropriate to consider the smallest structural entity inmaterials and its associated electronic states.
1.2 The free atom
1.2.1 The four electron quantum numbers
Rutherford conceived the atom to be a positively-charged nucleus, which carried the greater part of themass of the atom, with electrons clustering around it.
He suggested that the electrons were revolving round
the nucleus in circular orbits so that the centrifugalforce of the revolving electrons was just equal to the
electrostatic attraction between the positively-charged
nucleus and the negatively-charged electrons. In orderto avoid the difﬁculty that revolving electrons should,according to the classical laws of electrodynamics,
emit energy continuously in the form of electromag-
netic radiation, Bohr, in 1913, was forced to concludethat, of all the possible orbits, only certain orbits wereinfact permissible.Thesediscreteorbitswere assumed
to have the remarkable property that when an elec-
tron was in one of these orbits, no radiation could takeplace. The set of stable orbits was characterized by the
criterion that the angular momenta of the electrons in
the orbits were given by the expression nh/2/EM,w h e r e
his Planck’s constant and ncould only have integral
values ( nD1,2,3, etc.). In this way, Bohr was able to
give a satisfactory explanation of the line spectrum of
thehydrogenatomandtolaythefoundationofmodernatomic theory.
In later developments of the atomic theory, by de
Broglie, Schr ¨odinger and Heisenberg, it was realized
thattheclassicallawsofparticledynamicscouldnotbeapplied to fundamental particles. In classical dynamics
it is a prerequisite that the position and momentum of
a particle are known exactly: in atomic dynamics, ifeither the position or the momentum of a fundamentalparticle is known exactly, then the other quantity
cannot be determined. In fact, an uncertainty must
exist in our knowledge of the position and momentumof a small particle, and the product of the degree ofuncertainty for each quantity is related to the value
of Planck’s constant ⊿hD6.6256ð10
/NUL34Js/triangleleft.I nt h e
macroscopic world, this fundamental uncertainty is
too small to be measurable, but when treating the
motionofelectronsrevolvingroundanatomicnucleus,application of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is
essential.
The consequence of the Uncertainty Principle is that
we can no longer think of an electron as moving ina ﬁxed orbit around the nucleus but must consider
the motion of the electron in terms of a wave func-
tion. This function speciﬁes only the probability ofﬁnding one electron having a particular energy in thespace surrounding the nucleus. The situation is fur-
ther complicated by the fact that the electron behaves
not only as if it were revolving round the nucleusbut also as if it were spinning about its own axis.
Consequently, instead of specifying the motion of anelectron in an atom by a single integer n,a sr e q u i r e d
by the Bohr theory, it is now necessary to specifythe electron state using four numbers. These numbers,known as electron quantum numbers, are n,l,mand
s,w h e r e nis the principal quantum number, lis the
orbital(azimuthal) quantumnumber, misthemagnetic
quantum number and sis the spin quantum number.
Another basic premise of the modern quantum theoryoftheatomisthePauliExclusionPrinciple.Thisstates
that no two electrons in the same atom can have the
same numerical values for their set of four quantumnumbers.
If we are to understand the way in which the
Periodic Table of the chemical elements is built upin terms of the electronic structure of the atoms,we must now consider the signiﬁcance of the fourquantum numbers and the limitations placed uponthe numerical values that they can assume. The mostimportant quantum number is the principal quantumnumber since it is mainly responsible for determiningthe energy of the electron. The principal quantum
numbercanhaveintegralvaluesbeginningwith nD1,
which is the state of lowest energy, and electronshaving this value are the most stable, the stabilitydecreasing as nincreases. Electrons having a principal
quantum number ncan take up integral values of
the orbital quantum number lbetween 0 and ⊿n/NUL1/triangleleft.
Thus if nD1,lcan only have the value 0, while for
nD2,lD0o r1 ,a n df o r nD3,lD0, 1 or 2. The
orbital quantum number is associated with the angularmomentum of the revolving electron, and determineswhat would be regarded in non-quantum mechanical
terms as the shape of the orbit. For a given value of
n, the electron having the lowest value of lwill have
the lowest energy, and the higher the value of l,t h e
greater will be the energy.
The remaining two quantum numbers mandsare
concerned, respectively, with the orientation of theelectron’s orbit round the nucleus, and with the ori-entation of the direction of spin of the electron. For agiven value of l, an electron may have integral values
of the inner quantum number mfromClthrough 0
to/NULl. Thus for lD2,mcan take on the values C2,
C1, 0,/NUL1a n d/NUL2. The energies of electrons having
the same values of nand lbut different values of
mare the same, provided there is no magnetic ﬁeld
present. When a magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the energiesof electrons having different mvalues will be altered
slightly,as is shownby the splittingof spectral lines inthe Zeeman effect. The spin quantum number smay,
for an electron having the same values of n,landm,
take one of two values, that is, C
1
2or/NUL1
2. The fact
that these are non-integral values need not concern us
for the present purpose. We need only remember thattwo electrons in an atom can have the same valuesfor the three quantum numbers n,landm,a n dt h a t

1.2.2 Nomenclature for the electronic states
Before discussing the way in which the periodic clas-siﬁcation of the elements can be built up in terms ofthe electronic structure of the atoms, it is necessaryto outline the system of nomenclature which enables
us to describe the states of the electrons in an atom.
Since the energy of an electron is mainly determinedby the values of the principal and orbital quantumnumbers, it is only necessary to consider these in our
nomenclature. The principal quantum number is sim-
ply expressed by giving that number, but the orbitalquantum number is denoted by a letter. These letters,which derive from the early days of spectroscopy, are
s,p,dandf, which signify that the orbital quantum
numbers lare 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

When the principal quantum number nD1,lmust
be equal to zero, and an electron in this state would
be designated by the symbol 1 s. Such a state can
only have a single value of the inner quantum number
mD0, but can have values of C1
2or/NUL1
2for the spin
quantum number s. It follows, therefore, that there
are only two electrons in any one atom which can
be in a 1 s-state, and that these electrons will spin in
opposite directions. Thus when nD1, only s-states
1The letters, s,p,dandfarose from a classiﬁcation of
spectral lines into four groups, termed sharp, principal,diffuse and fundamental in the days before the present
quantum theory was developed.can exist and these can be occupied by only two
electrons. Once the two 1 s-states have been ﬁlled,
the next lowest energy state must have nD2. Here
lmay take the value 0 or 1, and therefore electrons
can be in either a 2 s-or a 2 p-state. The energy of
an electron in the 2 s-state is lower than in a 2 p-
state, and hence the 2 s-states will be ﬁlled ﬁrst. Once
more there are only two electrons in the 2 s-state, and
indeedthisisalwaystrueof s-states,irrespectiveofthe
value of the principal quantum number. The electrons
in the p-state can have values of mDC1, 0,/NUL1,
and electrons having each of these values for mcan
have two values of the spin quantum number, leading
therefore to the possibility of six electrons being in
any one p-state. These relationships are shown more
clearly in Table 1.1.
No further electrons can be added to the state for
nD2a f t e rt w o2 s-a n ds i x2 p-state are ﬁlled, and
the next electron must go into the state for whichnD3, whichisata higherenergy. Here thepossibility
arises for lto have the values 0, 1 and 2 and hence,
besides s-a n d p-states, d-states for which lD2 can
now occur. When lD2,mmay have the values
C2,C1,0,/NUL1,/NUL2 and each may be occupied by two
electrons of opposite spin, leading to a total of ten d-
states. Finally, when nD4,lwill have the possible
values from 0 to 4, and when lD4 the reader may
verify that there are fourteen 4 f-states.
Table 1.1 shows that the maximum number of elec-
trons in a given shell is 2 n

retain an earlier spectroscopic notation and to label thestates for which nD1,2,3,4,5,6 as K-, L-, M- N-,
O- and P-shells, respectively.

1.3 The Periodic Table
The Periodic Table provides an invaluable classiﬁ-
cation of all chemical elements, an element being acollection of atoms of one type. A typical version isshowninTable 1.2.Ofthe107elementswhichappear,about 90 occur in nature; the remainder are produced
in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. The atomic
number ( Z) of each element is stated, together with
its chemical symbol, and can be regarded as eitherthe number of protons in the nucleus or the num-ber of orbiting electrons in the atom. The elements
are naturally classiﬁed into periods (horizontal rows),
depending upon which electron shell is being ﬁlled,and groups (vertical columns). Elements in any onegroup have the electrons in their outermost shell in thesame conﬁguration,and, as a direct result, have similarchemical properties.
The building principle ( Aufbauprinzip ) for the Table
is based essentially upon two rules. First, the PauliExclusion Principle (Section 1.2.1) must be obeyed.Second, in compliance with Hund’s rule of max-imum multiplicity, the ground state should always
develop maximum spin. This effect is demonstrated
diagrammatically in Figure 1.2. Suppose that we sup-ply three electrons to the three ‘empty’ 2 p-orbitals.
They will build up a pattern of parallel spins (a) ratherthan paired spins (b). A fourth electron will causepairing (c). Occasionally, irregularities occur in the
‘ﬁlling’ sequence for energy states because electrons
always enter the lowest available energy state. Thus,4s-states, being at a lower energy level, ﬁll before the
3d-states.
We will now examine the general process by which
the Periodic Table is built up, electron by electron, in
closer detail. The progressive ﬁlling of energy statescan be followed in Table 1.3. The ﬁrst period com-mences with the simple hydrogen atom which has asingle proton in the nucleus and a single orbiting elec-tron ⊿ZD1/triangleleft. The atom is therefore electrically neu-
tral and for the lowest energy condition, the electron
will be in the 1 s-state. In helium, the next element,
the nucleus charge is increased by one proton andan additional electron maintains neutrality ⊿ZD2/triangleleft.
These two electrons ﬁll the 1 s-state and will nec-
essarily have opposite spins. The nucleus of helium
contains two neutrons as well as two protons, henceits mass is four times greater than that of hydrogen.
The next atom, lithium, has a nuclear charge of three⊿ZD3/triangleleftand, because the ﬁrst shell is full, an electron
must enter the 2 s-state which has a somewhat higher
energy. The electron in the 2 s-state, usually referred
to as the valency electron, is ‘shielded’ by the inner
electrons from the attracting nucleus and is therefore
less strongly bonded. As a result, it is relatively easyto separate this valency electron. The ‘electron core’
which remains contains two tightly-bound electrons
and, because it carries a single net positive charge,
is referred to as a monovalent cation. The overall pro-
cess by which electron(s) are lost or gained is knownas ionization.
The development of the ﬁrst short period from
lithium ( ZD3) to neon ( ZD10) can be conveniently
followed by referring to Table 1.3. So far, the sets of
states corresponding to two principal quantum num-
bers ( nD1,nD2) have been ﬁlled and the electrons
in these states are said to have formed closed shells. It
is a consequence of quantum mechanics that, once a
shellisﬁlled,theenergyofthatshellfallstoaverylowvalue and the resulting electronic conﬁguration is very
stable.Thus,helium,neon,argonandkryptonareasso-
ciated with closed shells and, being inherently stable
and chemically unreactive, are known collectively as
the inert gases.
The second short period, from sodium ⊿ZD11/triangleleftto
argon ⊿ZD18/triangleleft, commences with the occupation of
the 3 s-orbital and ends when the 3 p-orbitals are full
(Table 1.3). The long period which follows extends
from potassium ⊿ZD19/triangleleftto krypton ⊿ZD36/triangleleft, and, as
mentioned previously, has the unusual feature of the4s-stateﬁllingbeforethe3 d-state.Thus,potassiumhas
a similarity to sodium and lithium in that the electron
of highest energy is in an s-state; as a consequence,
they have very similar chemical reactivities, forming
the group known as the alkali-metal elements. After
calcium ⊿ZD20/triangleleft, ﬁlling of the 3 d-state begins.
The 4 s-state is ﬁlled in calcium ⊿ZD20/triangleleftand
the ﬁlling of the 3 d-state becomes energetically
favourable to give scandium ⊿ZD21/triangleleft. This belated
ﬁlling of the ﬁve 3 d-orbitals from scandium to its
completion in copper ⊿ZD29/triangleleftembraces the ﬁrst
series of transition elements. One member of this
series, chromium ⊿ZD24/triangleleft, obviously behaves in an
unusual manner. Applying Hund’s rule, we can reason

that maximization of parallel spin is achieved by
locating six electrons, of like spin, so that ﬁve ﬁll
the 3 d-states and one enters the 4 s-state. This mode
of fully occupying the 3 d-states reduces the energy
of the electrons in this shell considerably. Again, in
copper ⊿ZD29/triangleleft, the last member of this transition
series, complete ﬁlling of all 3 d-orbitals also produces
a signiﬁcant reduction in energy. It follows from these
explanations that the 3 d-a n d4 s-levels of energy are
very close together. After copper, the energy states ﬁll
in a straightforward manner and the ﬁrst long period
ﬁnishes with krypton ⊿ZD36/triangleleft. It will be noted that
lanthanides ( ZD57 to 71) and actinides ( ZD89 to
103), because of their state-ﬁlling sequences, have
been separated from the main body of Table 1.2.
Having demonstrated the manner in which quantum
rules are applied to the construction of the Periodic
Table for the ﬁrst 36 elements, we can now examinesome general aspects of the classiﬁcation.
When one considers the small step difference
of one electron between adjacent elements in the
Periodic Table, it is not really surprising to ﬁnd
that the distinction between metallic and non-metallic
elements is imprecise. In fact there is an intermediate
range of elements, the metalloids, which share theproperties of both metals and non-metals. However,
we can regard the elements which can readily lose an
electron, by ionization or bond formation, as strongly
metallic in character (e.g. alkali metals). Conversely,
elements which have a strong tendency to acquire an
electron and thereby form a stable conﬁguration of
two or eight electrons in the outermost shell are non-
metallic (e.g. the halogens ﬂuorine, chlorine, bromine,
iodine). Thus electropositive metallic elements andthe electronegative non-metallic elements lie on the
left- and right-hand sides of the Periodic Table,
respectively. As will be seen later, these and other
aspects of the behaviour of the outermost (valence)
electrons have a profound and determining effect upon
bonding and therefore upon electrical, magnetic and
optical properties.
Prior to the realization that the frequently observed
periodicitiesof chemical behaviour could be expressedin terms of electronic conﬁgurations, emphasis was
placed upon ‘atomic weight’. This quantity, which
is now referred to as relative atomic mass, increases
steadily throughout the Periodic Table as protons
and neutrons are added to the nuclei. Atomic mass
1
determines physical properties such as density, spe-
ciﬁc heat capacity and ability to absorb electromag-
netic radiation: it is therefore very relevant to engi-
neering practice. For instance, many ceramics are
based upon the light elements aluminium, silicon and
oxygen and consequently have a low density, i.e.
<3000 kg m/NUL3.
1Atomic mass is now expressed relative to the datum value
for carbon (12.01). Thus, a copper atom has 63.55/12.01 or5.29 times more mass than a carbon atom.1.4 Interatomic bonding in materials
Matter can exist in three states and as atoms change
directly from either the gaseous state (desublimation)or the liquid state (solidiﬁcation) to the usuallydenser solid state, the atoms form aggregates in three-dimensional space. Bonding forces develop as atomsare brought into proximity to each other. Sometimesthese forces are spatially-directed. The nature of thebonding forces has a direct effect upon the type ofsolid structure which develops and therefore uponthe physical properties of the material. Melting pointprovides a useful indication of the amount of thermalenergyneededtosevertheseinteratomic(orinterionic)bonds. Thus, some solids melt at relatively lowtemperatures (m.p. of tin D232
°C) whereas many
ceramics melt at extremely high temperatures (m.p. ofalumina exceeds 2000
°C). It is immediately apparent
that bond strength has far-reaching implications in all
ﬁelds of engineering.
Customarily we identify four principal types of
bonding in materials, namely, metallic bonding, ionicbonding, covalent bonding and the comparativelymuch weaker van der Waals bonding. However, inmany solid materials it is possible for bonding to bemixed, or even intermediate, in character. We will ﬁrstconsider the general chemical features of each type ofbonding; in Chapter 2 we will examine the resultantdisposition of the assembled atoms (ions) in three-dimensional space.
As we have seen, the elements with the most pro-
nounced metallic characteristics are grouped on theleft-hand side of the Periodic Table (Table 1.2). Ingeneral, they have a few valence electrons, outsidethe outermost closed shell, which are relatively easyto detach. In a metal, each ‘free’ valency electron isshared among all atoms, rather than associated with anindividual atom, and forms part of the so-called ‘elec-trongas’whichcirculatesatrandomamongtheregulararray of positively-charged electron cores, or cations(Figure 1.3a). Application of an electric potential gra-dient will cause the ‘gas’ to drift though the structurewith little hindrance, thus explaining the outstandingelectrical conductivity of the metallic state. The metal-licbondderivesfromtheattractionbetweenthecationsandthefreeelectronsand,aswouldbeexpected,repul-sive components of force develop when cations arebrought into close proximity. However, the bondingforces in metallic structures are spatially non-directedand we can readily simulate the packing and space-ﬁlling characteristics of the atoms with modelling sys-tems based on equal-sized spheres (polystyrene balls,even soap bubbles). Other properties such as ductility,thermal conductivity and the transmittance of electro-magnetic radiation are also directly inﬂuenced by thenon-directionality and high electron mobility of themetallic bond.
The ionic bond develops when electron(s) are trans-
ferred from atoms of active metallic elements to atomsof active non-metallic elements, thereby enabling each

of the resultant ions to attain a stable closed shell.
For example, the ionic structure of magnesia (MgO),
a ceramic oxide, forms when each magnesium atom
⊿ZD12/triangleleftloses two electrons from its L-shell ⊿nD2/triangleleft
and these electrons are acquired by an oxygen atom⊿ZD8/triangleleft, producing a stable octet conﬁguration in its
L-shell (Table 1.3). Overall, the ionic charges balance
and the structure is electrically neutral (Figure 1.3b).Anions are usually larger than cations. Ionic bonding
is omnidirectional, essentially electrostatic in charac-
terandcanbeextremelystrong;forinstance,magnesia
is a very useful refractory oxide ⊿m.p.D2930

lowtomoderate temperatures, suchstructuresare elec-trical insulators but, typically, become conductive at
high temperatures when thermal agitation of the ions
increases their mobility.
Sharing of valence electrons is the key feature of
the third type of strong primary bonding. Covalentbonds form when valence electrons of opposite spin
fromadjacentatomsareabletopairwithinoverlapping
spatially-directed orbitals, thereby enabling each atom
toattainastableelectronicconﬁguration(Figure 1.3c).Being oriented in three-dimensional space, these local-
ized bonds are unlike metallic and ionic bonds. Fur-thermore, the electrons participating in the bonds aretightly bound so that covalent solids, in general, havelow electrical conductivity and act as insulators, some-times as semiconductors (e.g. silicon). Carbon in theform of diamond is an interesting prototype for cova-lent bonding. Its highhardness, low coefﬁcient of ther-mal expansion and very high melting point ⊿3300
°C/triangleleft
bear witness to the inherent strength of the cova-lent bond. First, using the (8 – N) Rule, in which
N is the Group Number
1in the Periodic Table, we
deduce that carbon ⊿ZD6/triangleleftis tetravalent; that is, four
bond-forming electrons are available from the L-shell⊿nD2/triangleleft. In accordance with Hund’s Rule (Figure 1.2),

ducing an overall conﬁguration of 1 s

The structure and bonding of atoms 9
has four valency electrons of like spin available for
pairing. Thus each carbon atom can establish electron-sharing orbitals with four neighbours. For a given
atom, these four bonds are of equal strength and are
set at equal angles ⊿109.5
°/triangleleftto each other and therefore
exhibit tetrahedral symmetry. (The structural conse-
quences of this important feature will be discussed in
Chapter 2.)
This process by which s-orbitals and p-orbitals
combinetoformprojectinghybrid sp-orbitalsisknown
as hybridization. It is observed in elements other thancarbon. For instance, trivalent boron ⊿ZD5/triangleleftforms
three co-planar sp
2-orbitals. In general, a large degree
of overlap of sp-orbitals and/or a high electron density
within the overlap ‘cloud’ will lead to an increase
in the strength of the covalent bond. As indicated
earlier,itispossibleforamaterialtopossessmorethan
one type of bonding. For example, in calcium silicate
⊿Ca2SiO4/triangleleft, calcium cations Ca2Care ionically bonded
to tetrahedral SiO 44/NULclusters in which each silicon
atom is covalently-bonded to four oxygen neighbours.
The ﬁnal type of bonding is attributed to the van-
der Waals forces which develop when adjacent atoms,
or groups of atoms, act as electric dipoles. Suppose
that two atoms which differ greatly in size combine to
form a molecule as a result of covalent bonding. The
resultant electron ‘cloud’ for the whole molecule canbe pictured as pear-shaped and will have an asymmet-
rical distribution of electron charge. An electric dipole
has formed and it follows that weak directed forces
of electrostatic attraction can exist in an aggregate
of such molecules (Figure 1.3d). There are no ‘free’
electrons hence electrical conduction is not favoured.
Although secondary bonding by van der Waals forces
is weak in comparison to the three forms of primary
bonding, it has practical signiﬁcance. For instance,in the technologically-important mineral talc, which
is hydrated magnesium silicate Mg
3Si4O10⊿OH/triangleleft2,t h e
parallelcovalently-bondedlayersofatomsareattracted
toeachotherbyvanderWaalsforces.Theselayerscan
easily be slid past each other, giving the mineral its
characteristically slippery feel. In thermoplastic poly-
mers, van der Waals forces of attraction exist between
the extended covalently-bonded hydrocarbon chains; a
combination of heat and applied shear stress will over-come these forces and cause the molecular chains to
glide past each other. To quote a more general case,
molecules of water vapour in the atmosphere each
have an electric dipole and will accordingly tend to
be adsorbed if they strike solid surfaces possessing
attractive van der Waals forces (e.g. silica gel).
1.5 Bonding and energy levels
If one imagines atoms being brought together uni-formly to form, for example, a metallic structure,
then when the distance between neighbouring atoms
approaches the interatomic value the outer electrons
are no longer localized around individual atoms. Oncethe outer electrons can no longer be considered to be
attached to individual atoms but have become free tomove throughout the metal then, because of the PauliExclusion Principle, these electrons cannot retain thesame set of quantum numbers that they had when theywere part of the atoms. As a consequence, the free
electrons can no longer have more than two electrons
of opposite spin with a particular energy. The energiesof the free electrons are distributed over a range whichincreases as the atoms are brought together to formthe metal. If the atoms when brought together are toform a stable metallic structure, it is necessary that the
mean energy of the free electrons shall be lower than
the energy of the electron level in the free atom fromwhich they are derived. Figure 1.4 shows the broaden-ingofanatomicelectronlevelastheatomsarebroughttogether, and also the attendant lowering of energy ofthe electrons. It is the extent of the lowering in mean
energy of the outer electrons that governs the stability
of a metal. The equilibriumspacing between the atomsin a metal is that for which any further decrease in theatomic spacing would lead to an increase in the repul-sive interaction of the positive ions as they are forcedinto closer contact with each other, which would begreater than the attendant decrease in mean electron
energy.
In a metallic structure, the free electrons must,
therefore, be thought of as occupying a series ofdiscrete energy levels at very close intervals. Eachatomic level whichsplitsintoa bandcontainsthe samenumber of energy levels as the number Nof atoms
in the piece of metal. As previously stated, only two
electrons of oppositespin can occupy any one level, sothat a band can contain a maximum of 2 Nelectrons.
Clearly, in the lowest energy state of the metal all thelower energy levels are occupied.
The energy gap between successive levels is not
constant but decreases as the energy of the levels
increases. This is usually expressed in terms of thedensity of electronic states N(E)as a function of the
energy E. The quantity N⊿E/triangleleftdEgives the number of

free electrons is a parabolic function of the energy, asshown in Figure 1.5.
Because only two electrons can occupy each level,
the energy of an electron occupying a low-energylevel cannot be increased unless it is given sufﬁcientenergy to allow it to jump to an empty level at the
top of the band. The energy
1width of these bands is
commonlyabout5or6 eVand,therefore,considerableenergy would have to be put into the metal to excitea low-lying electron. Such energies do not occur atnormal temperatures, and only those electrons withenergies close to that of the top of the band (known

therefore only a small number of the free electronsin a metal can take part in thermal processes. Theenergy of the Fermi level E
Fdepends on the number
of electrons Nper unit volume V, and is given by
⊿h2/8m/triangleleft⊿3N//EMV/triangleleft2/3.
The electron in a metallic band must be thought
of as moving continuously through the structure withan energy depending on which level of the band itoccupies. In quantum mechanical terms, this motionof the electron can be considered in terms of a wave
with a wavelength which is determined by the energy
of the electron according to de Broglie’s relationship/NAKDh/mv, where his Planck’s constant and mand v
are, respectively, the mass and velocity of the moving
electron. The greater the energy of the electron, the
higherwillbeitsmomentum mv,andhencethesmaller
will be the wavelength of the wave function in termsof which its motion can be described. Because themovement of an electron has this wave-like aspect,
moving electrons can give rise, like optical waves, to
diffraction effects. This property of electrons is usedin electron microscopy (Chapter 5).

Atomic arrangements in materials
2.1 The concept of ordering
When attempting to classify a material it is useful to
decide whether it is crystalline (conventional metals
and alloys), non-crystalline (glasses) or a mixture ofthese two types of structure. The critical distinction
between the crystalline and non-crystalline states
of matter can be made by applying the conceptof ordering. Figure 2.1a shows a symmetrical two-
dimensional arrangement of two different types ofatom. Abasicfeature ofthisaggregateisthenestingof
a small atom within the triangular group of three muchlarger atoms. This geometrical condition is called
short-range ordering. Furthermore, these triangular
groups are regularly arranged relative to each otherso that if the aggregate were to be extended, we
could conﬁdently predict the locations of any added
atoms. In effect, we are taking advantage of the long-range ordering characteristic of this array. The arrayof Figure 2.1a exhibits both short- and long-range
Figure 2.1 Atomic ordering in (a) crystals and (b) glasses of the same composition (from Kingery, Bowen and Uhlmann,
1976; by permission of Wiley-Interscience) .
12Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
ordering and is typical of a single crystal. In the other
array of Figure 2.1b, short-range order is discerniblebutlong-rangeorderisclearlyabsent.Thissecondtype
of atomic arrangement is typical of the glassy state.
1
It is possible for certain substances to exist in
either crystalline or glassy forms (e.g. silica). From
Figure 2.1 we can deduce that, for such a substance,
the glassy state will have the lower bulk density.
Furthermore, incomparingthetwodegrees ofordering
of Figures 2.1a and 2.1b, one can appreciate why thestructures of comparatively highly-ordered crystalline
substances,suchaschemical compounds,minerals and
metals, have tended to be more amenable to scientiﬁc
investigation than glasses.
2.2 Crystal lattices and structures
We can rationalize the geometry of the simple repre-
sentation of a crystal structure shown in Figure 2.1a
by adding a two-dimensional frame of reference, or
space lattice, with line intersections at atom centres.
Extending this process to three dimensions, we can
construct a similar imaginary space lattice in whichtripleintersectionsof three families of parallelequidis-
tant lines mark the positions of atoms (Figure 2.2a).
In this simple case, three reference axes ( x,y,z)a r e
oriented at 90
°to each other and atoms are ‘shrunk’,
for convenience. The orthogonal lattice of Figure 2.2a
deﬁnes eight unit cells, each having a shared atom at
every corner. It follows from our recognition of the
inherent order of the lattice that we can express the
1The terms glassy, non-crystalline, vitreous and amorphous
are synonymous.geometrical characteristics of the whole crystal, con-
taining millions of atoms, in terms of the size, shapeand atomic arrangement of the unit cell, the ultimate
repeat unit of structure.
2
We can assign the lengths of the three cell
parameters ( a,b,c) to the reference axes, using an
internationally-accepted notation (Figure 2.2b). Thus,for the simple cubic case portrayed in Figure 2.2a, xD

only need to quote a single cell parameter ( a)f o rt h e
cubic unit cell. By systematically changing the angles⊿˛, ˇ, /CR/triangleleft between the reference axes, and the cell
parameters ( a,b,c), and by four skewing operations,
we derive the seven crystal systems (Figure 2.3). Anycrystal, whether natural or synthetic, belongs to one
or other of these systems. From the premise that
each point of a space lattice should have identicalsurroundings, Bravais demonstrated that the maximumpossible number of space lattices (and therefore unitcells) is 14. It is accordingly necessary to augmentthe seven primitive (P) cells shown in Figure 2.3 withseven more non-primitive cells which have additionalface-centring, body-centring or end-centring latticepoints. Thus the highly-symmetrical cubic system hasthree possible lattices: primitive (P), body-centred (I;from the German word innenzentrierte ) and face-
centred (F). We will encounter the latter two again inSection 2.5.1. True primitive space lattices, in which
2The notion that the striking external appearance of crystals
indicates the existence of internal structural units with
similar characteristics of shape and orientation wasproposed by the French mineralogist Hauy in 1784. Some
130 years elapsed before actual experimental proof was
provided by the new technique of X-ray diffraction analysis.

sometimes embody awkward angles. In such cases it
is common practice to use a simpler orthogonal non-primitive lattice which will accommodate the atoms of

1Lattices are imaginary and limited in number; crystal
structures are real and virtually unlimited in their variety.2.3 Crystal directions and planes
In a structurally-disordered material, such as fully-
annealed silica glass, the value of a physical property
is independent of the direction of measurement; thematerial is said to be isotropic. Conversely, in many
single crystals, it is often observed that a structurally-
sensitive property, such as electrical conductivity, isstrongly direction-dependent because of variations in

the periodicity and packing of atoms. Such crystals
are anisotropic. We therefore need a precise method
for specifying a direction, and equivalent directions,
within a crystal. The general method for deﬁning a
given direction is to construct a line through the originparallel to the required direction and then to deter-
mine the coordinates of a point on this line in terms
of cell parameters ( a,b,c). Hence, in Figure 2.4a,
the direction/NUL!AB is obtained by noting the transla-
tory movements needed to progress from the origin Oto point C, i.e. aD1,bD1,cD1. These coordinate
valuesareenclosedinsquarebracketstogivethedirec-
tionindices[111]. Insimilarfashion,thedirection/NUL!DE
can be shown to be [
1/211] with the bar sign indi-
cating use of a negative axis. Directions which are
crystallographically equivalent in a given crystal are
represented by angular brackets. Thus, h100irepre-
sents all cube edge directions and comprises [100],
[010], [001], [ 100], [0 10] and [00 1] directions.
Directions are often represented in non-speciﬁc terms
as [uvw]a n dhuvwi.
Physical events and transformations within crystals
often take place on certain families of parallel equidis-
tant planes. The orientation of these planes in three-
dimensional space is of prime concern; their size and
shape is of lesser consequence. (Similar ideas apply to
the corresponding external facets of a single crystal.)In the Miller system for indexing planes, the intercepts
of a representative plane upon the three axes ( x,y,z)
are noted.
1Intercepts are expressed relatively in terms
ofa,b,c.Planesparalleltoanaxisaresaidtointercept

Miller indices (111)
The Miller indices for the planes DEFG and BCHI are
(010) and (110), respectively. Often it is necessary
to ignore individual planar orientations and to specifyall planes of a given crystallographic type, such asthe planes parallel to the six faces of a cube. Theseplanes constitute a crystal form and have the sameatomic conﬁgurations; they are said to be equivalentand can be represented by a single group of indicesenclosed in curly brackets, or braces. Thus, f100g
represents a form of six planar orientations, i.e. (100),
(010), (001), (
100),(0 10)and(00 1). Returning to
the (111) plane ABC of Figure 2.4b, it is instructivetoderivetheothersevenequivalentplanes,centringonthe origin O, which comprise f111g. It will then be
seenwhymaterialsbelongingtothecubicsystemoftencrystallize in an octahedral form in which octahedralf111gplanes are prominent.
It should be borne in mind that the general purpose
of the Miller procedure is to deﬁne the orientation ofa family of parallel equidistant planes; the selectionof a convenient representative plane is a means to thisend. For this reason, it is permissible to shift the originprovided that the relative disposition of a,band cis
maintained.Millerindicesarecommonlywritteninthesymbolic form ( hkl). Rationalization of indices, either
to reduce them to smaller numbers with the same ratioor to eliminate fractions, is unnecessary. This often-recommendedstepdiscardsinformation;afterall,thereis a real difference between the two families of planes(100) and (200).

Figure 2.5 Prismatic, basal and pyramidal planes in hexagonal structures .
As mentioned previously, it is sometimes conve-
nient to choose a non-primitive cell. The hexagonal
structure cell is an important illustrative example. For
reasons which will be explained, it is also appropri-
ate to use a four-axis Miller-Bravais notation ( hkil)
for hexagonal crystals, instead of the three-axis Millernotation ( hkl). In this alternative method, three axes
(a
1,a2,a3) are arranged at 120 °to each other in a
basal plane and the fourth axis ( c) is perpendicular
to this plane (Figure 2.5a). Hexagonal structures are
often compared in terms of the axial ratio c/a.T h e
indices are determined by taking intercepts upon the
axes in strict sequence. Thus the procedural steps for
the plane ABCD, which is one of the six prismatic
planes bounding the complete cell, are:

Miller-Bravais indices (1 100)
Comparison of these digits with those from other pris-
matic planes such as (10 10), (01 10) and (1 100)
immediately reveals a similarity; that is, they are crys-
tallographically equivalent and belong to the f1010 g
form. The three-axis Miller method lacks this advan-
tageous feature when applied to hexagonal structures.For geometrical reasons, it is essential to ensure that
the plane indices comply with the condition ⊿hCk/triangleleftD
/NULi. In addition to the prismatic planes, basal planes

The Miller-Bravais system also accommodates
directions, producing indices of the form [ uvtw]. The
ﬁrst three translations in the basal plane must becarefully adjusted so that the geometrical conditionuC
vD/NUL tapplies. This adjustment can be facilitated
by sub-dividing the basal planes into triangles

revealed; for instance, the close-packed directions in
the basal plane have the indices [2 110], [11 20],
[1210], etc. and can be represented by h2110i.
2.4 Stereographic projection
Projective geometry makes it possible to represent the
relative orientation of crystal planes and directions
in three-dimensional space in a more convenienttwo-dimensional form. The standard stereographic
projection is frequently used in the analysis of crystal
behaviour; X-ray diffraction analyses usually providethe experimental data. Typical applications of the
method are the interpretation of strain markings on
crystalsurfaces,portrayalofsymmetricalrelationships,determination of the axial orientations in a single
crystal and the plotting of property values for
anisotropic single crystals. (The basic method can alsobe adapted to produce a pole ﬁgure diagram which canshow preferred orientation effects in polycrystalline
aggregates.)
A very small crystal of cubic symmetry is assumed
to be located at the centre of a reference sphere, as
shown in Figure 2.7a, so that the orientation of a crys-
tal plane, such as the (111) plane marked, may berepresented on the surface of the sphere by the point
of intersection, or pole, of its normal P. The angle /RS
between the two poles (001) and (111), shown inFigure 2.7b, can then be measured in degrees along
the arc of the great circle between the poles P and P
0.
To represent all the planes in a crystal in this three-dimensional way is rather cumbersome; in the stereo-
graphic projection, the array of poles which represents
the various planes in the crystal is projected from thereference sphere onto the equatorial plane. The pattern
ofpolesprojectedontheequatorial,or primitive,plane
thenrepresentsthestereographicprojectionofthecrys-tal. As shown in Figure 2.7c, poles in the northern half
of the reference sphere are projected onto the equa-
torial plane by joining the pole P to the south poleS, while those in the southern half of the reference
sphere, such as Q, are projected in the same way in the
direction of the north pole N. Figure 2.8a shows thestereographic projection of some simple cubic planes,
f100g,f110gandf111g, from which it can be seen
that those crystallographic planes which have poles in
the southern half of the reference sphere are repre-
sented by circles in the stereogram, while those which
have poles in the northern half are represented by dots.
As shown in Figure 2.7b, the angle between two
poles on the reference sphere is the number of degrees
separating them on the great circle passing through
them. The angle between P and P
0can be determined
by means of a hemispherical transparent cap graduated
and marked with meridian circles and latitude circles,
as in geographical work. With a stereographic rep-
resentation of poles, the equivalent operation can be
performed in the plane of the primitive circle by using
atransparentplanarnet,knownasaWulffnet.Thisnet
is graduated in intervals of 2 °, with meridians in the
projection extending from top to bottom and latitude
lines from side to side.1Thus, to measure the angular
distance between any two poles in the stereogram, the
net is rotated about the centre until the two poles lie
upon the same meridian, which then corresponds to
one of the great circles of the reference sphere. The
angle between the two poles is then measured as the
difference in latitude along the meridian. Some useful
crystallographic rules may be summarized:
1. The Weiss Zone Law: the plane ( hkl) is a member
of the zone [ uvw]i f huCkvClwD0. A set of
planes which all contain a common direction [ uvw]
is known as a zone; [ uvw] is the zone axis (rather
like the spine of an open book relative to the ﬂat
leaves).Forexample,thethreeplanes(1 10),(011)
and (101) form a zone about the [111] direction
(Figure 2.8a). The pole of each plane containing
[uvw] must lie at 90 °to [uvw]; therefore these three
poles all lie in the same plane and upon the same
great circle trace. The latter is known as the zone
circle or zone trace. A plane trace is to a plane as
a zone circle is to a zone. Uniquely, in the cubic

which the N–S axis of the reference sphere is perpendicularto the equatorial plane of projection.

same indices lie on top of one another.

also contains any linear combination of them,
e.g. m⊿h1k1l1/triangleleftCn⊿h2k2l2/triangleleft. For example, the
zone [111] contains (1 10) and (01 1) and it
must therefore contain ⊿110/triangleleftC⊿011/triangleleftD⊿101/triangleleft,
⊿110/triangleleftC2⊿011/triangleleftD⊿112/triangleleft, etc. The same is true
for different directions in a zone, provided that the
crystal is cubic.
3. The Law of Vector Addition: the direction
[u1/ETB1w1]C[u2/ETB2w2] lies between [ u1/ETB1w1]a n d
[u2/ETB2w2].

two directions. Provided that the crystal system is
cubic, the angles between planes may be found by

this expression.
When constructing the standard stereogram of any
crystal it is advantageous to examine the symmetry
elements of that structure. As an illustration, consider
a cubic crystal, since this has the highest symme-
try of any crystal class. Close scrutiny shows that
the cube has thirteen axes of symmetry; these axes
comprise three fourfold (tetrad) axes, four threefold
(triad) axes and six twofold (diad) axes, as indicated in
Figure 2.9a. (This diagram shows the standard square,
triangular and lens-shaped symbols for the three types
of symmetry axis.) An n-fold axis of symmetry oper-
ates in such a way that after rotation through an angle2/EM/n, the crystal comes into an identical or self-
coincident position in space. Thus, a tetrad axis passes
through the centre of each face of the cube parallel to
one of the edges, and a rotation of 90
°in either direc-
tion about one of these axes turns the cube into a new

positionwhichiscrystallographicallyindistinguishable
from the old position. Similarly, the cube diagonalsform a set of four threefold axes, and each of the lines
18Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
passingthroughthe centre of oppositeedges form a set
of six twofold symmetry axes. Some tetrad, triad anddiad axes are marked on the spherical projection of a
cubic crystal shown in Figure 2.8b. The cube also has
nine planes of symmetry (Figure 2.9b) and one centreof symmetry, giving, together with the axes, a total of23 elements of symmetry.
In the stereographic projection of Figure 2.8a,
planes of symmetry divide the stereogram into 24
equivalent spherical triangles, commonly called unittriangles, which correspond to the 48 (24 on the topand 24 on the bottom) seen in the spherical projection.The two-, three- and fourfold symmetry about the
f110g,f111gand f100gpoles, respectively, is
apparent. It is frequently possible to analyse a problemin terms of a single unit triangle. Finally, referenceto a stereogram (Figure 2.8a) conﬁrms rule (2) whichstates that the indices of any plane can be found
merely by adding simple multiples of other planes
which lie in the same zone. For example, the (011)plane lies between the (001) and (010) planes andclearly 011 D001 C010. Owing to the action of the
symmetry elements, it can be reasoned that there must
be a total of 12 f011gplanes because of the respective
three- and fourfold symmetry about the f111gand
f100gaxes. As a further example, it is clear that the
(112) plane lies between the (001) plane and (111)
plane since 112 D001 C111 and that the f112g
form must contain 24 planes, i.e. a icositetrahedron.The plane (123), which is an example of the mostgeneral crystal plane in the cubic system because itshklindices are all different, lies between (112) and
(011) planes; the 48 planes of the f123gform make
up a hexak-isoctahedron.
The tetrahedral form, a direct derivative of the
cubic form, is often encountered in materials science(Figure 2.10a). Its symmetry elements comprise four
triad axes, three diad axes and six ‘mirror’ planes, as
shown in the stereogram of Figure 2.10b.
Concepts of symmetry, when developed systemat-
ically, provide invaluable help in modern structuralanalysis. As already implied, there are three basic ele-
ments, or operations, of symmetry. These operations
involve translation (movement along parameters a,b,
c), rotation (about axes to give diads, triads, etc.) and
reﬂection (across ‘mirror’ planes). Commencing withan atom (or group of atoms) at either a lattice point or
at a small group of lattice points, a certain combina-
tion of symmetry operations will ultimately lead to thethree-dimensional development of any type of crystalstructure. The procedure provides a unique identifyingcode for a structure and makes it possible to locate
it among 32 point groups and 230 space groups of
symmetry. This classiﬁcation obviously embraces theseven crystal systems. Although many metallic struc-turescan bedeﬁned relativelysimplyinterms of spacelattice and one or more lattice constants, complex
structures require the key of symmetry theory.

2.5 Selected crystal structures
2.5.1 Pure metals
We now examine the crystal structures of various
elements (metallic and non-metallic) and compounds,
using examples to illustrate important structure-
building principles and structure/property relations.1
Most elements in the Periodic Table are metallic in
character; accordingly, we commence with them.
Metalionsarerelativelysmall,withdiametersinthe
order of 0.25 nm. A millimetre cube of metal therefore
contains about 1020atoms. The like ions in pure solid
metal are packed together in a highly regular manner
and, in the majority of metals, are packed so that ions
collectively occupy the minimum volume. Metals are
normally crystalline and for all of them, irrespective
of whether the packing of ions is close or open, it
1Where possible, compound structures of engineering
importance have been selected as illustrative examples.Prototype structures, such as NaCl, ZnS, CaF
2, etc., which
appear in standard treatments elsewhere, are indicated asappropriate.
Atomic arrangements in materials 19

is possible to deﬁne and express atomic arrangements
in terms of structure cells (Section 2.2). Furthermore,
because of the non-directional nature of the metallicbond, it is also possibleto simulate these arrangementsby simple ‘hard-sphere’ modelling.
There are two ways of packing spheres of equal
size together so that they occupy the minimum vol-
ume. The structure cells of the resulting arrangements,face-centred cubic (fcc) and close-packed hexagonal(cph),areshowninFigures 2.11aand 2.11b.Theotherstructure cell (Figure 2.11c) has a body-centred cubic
(bcc)arrangement;althoughmore‘open’andnotbased
on close-packing, it is nevertheless adopted by manymetals.
In order to specify the structure of a particular metal
completely, it is necessary to give not only the type
of crystal structure adopted by the metal but also the
dimensionsofthestructurecell.Incubicstructurecellsit is only necessary to give the length of an edge a,
whereas in a hexagonal cell the two parameters aand
cmust be given, as indicated in Figures 2.11a–c. If a
hexagonal structure is ideally close-packed, the ratioc/amust be 1.633. In hexagonal metal structures, the
axial ratio c/ais never exactly 1.633. These structures
are, therefore, never quite ideally closed-packed, e.g.
c/a(Zn) D1.856, c/a(Ti)D1.587. As the axial ratio
approaches unity, the properties of cph metals beginto show similarities to fcc metals.
A knowledge of cell parameters permits the atomic
radius rof the metal atoms to be calculated on the
assumption that they are spherical and that they are
in closest possible contact. The reader should verify
that in the fcc structure r D⊿ap

structure rD⊿ap
3/triangleleft/4, where ais the cell parameter.The coordination number (CN), an important con-
cept in crystal analysis, is deﬁned as the number of
nearest equidistant neighbouring atoms around any
atom in the crystal structure. Thus, in the bcc struc-ture shown in Figure 2.11c the atom at the centre of
the cube in surrounded by eight equidistant atoms,
i.e. CN D8. It is perhaps not so readily seen from
Figure 2.11a that the coordination number for the fcc
structure is 12. Perhaps the easiest method of visu-
alizing this is to place two fcc cells side by side,
and then count the neighbours of the common face-
centring atom. In the cph structure with ideal packing
⊿c/a D1.633/triangleleftthe coordination number is again 12, as
can be seen by once more considering two cells, one
stacked on top of the other, and choosing the centreatom of the common basal plane. This (0001) basal
plane has the densest packing of atoms and has the
same atomic arrangement as the closest-packed plane
in the fcc structure.
1
The cph and fcc structures represent two effective
methods of packing spheres closely; the difference
between them arises from the different way in which
the close-packed planes are stacked. Figure 2.12a
shows an arrangement of atoms in A-sites of a close-
packed plane. When a second plane of close-packed
atoms is laid down, its ﬁrst atom may be placed in
either aB-site or a C-site, which are entirely equiva-
lent. However, once the ﬁrst atom is placed in one of
these two types of site, all other atoms in the second

planes of the fcc structure are f111g; these planes are best
revealed by balancing a ball-and-stick model of the fcc cellon one corner.

plane must be in similar sites. (This is because neigh-
bouringB-a n dCsites are too close together for both
to be occupied in the same layer.) At this stage thereis no difference between the cph and fcc structure; the
difference arises only when the third layer is put in
position. In building up the third layer, assuming thatsites of type Bhave been used to construct the second
layer, as shown in Figure 2.12b, either A-sites orC-
sites may be selected. If A-sites are chosen, then the
atoms in the third layer will be directly above those in
the ﬁrst layer, and the structure will be cph, whereas
ifC-sites are chosen this will not be the case and the
structure will be fcc. Thus a cph structure consists of
layers of close-packed atoms stacked in the sequence
ofABABAB or, of course, equally well, ACACAC .
An fcc structure has the stacking sequence ABCAB-
CABCso that the atoms in the fourth layer lie directly
abovethoseinthebottomlayer.Thedensityofpackingwithin structures is sometimes expressed as an atomic
packing fraction (APF) which is the fraction of the cell
volume occupied by atoms. The APF value for a bcccell is 0.68; it rises to 0.74 for the more closely packed
fcc and cph cells.
Table 2.1 gives the crystal structures adopted by
some typical metals, the majority of which are eitherfcc or bcc. As indicated previously, an atom does not
have precise dimensions; however, it is convenient to
express atomic diameters as the closest distance ofapproach between atom centres. Table 2.1 lists struc-
tures that are stable at room temperature; at other
temperatures, some metals undergo transition and theatoms rearrange to form a different crystal structure,
each structure being stable over a deﬁnite interval of
temperature. This phenomenon is known as allotropy.The best-known commercially-exploitable example is
thatof iron,whichisbccat temperatures below910
°C,
fcc in the temperature range 910–1400 °C and bcc at
temperatures between 1400 °C and the melting point
⊿1535°C/triangleleft. Other common examples include titanium
and zirconium which change from cph to bcc at tem-peratures of 882
°C and 815 °C, respectively, tin, which
changes from cubic (grey) to tetragonal (white) at
13.2°C, and the metals uranium and plutonium. Pluto-
nium is particularly complex in that it has six different
allotropes between room temperature and its melting
point of 640 °C.
These transitions between allotropes are usually
reversible and, because they necessitate rearrangement
of atoms, are accompanied by volume changes andeither the evolution or absorption of thermal energy.
Atomic arrangements in materials 21
The transition can be abrupt but is often sluggish. For-
tunately, tetragonal tin can persist in a metastable stateat temperatures below the nominal transition temper-
ature. However, the eventual transition to the friable
low-density cubic form can be very sudden.

Using the concept of a unit cell, together with data
on the atomic mass of constituent atoms, it is possible
to derive a theoretical value for the density of a puresingle crystal. The parameter afor the bcc cell of pure
iron at room temperature is 0.286 64 nm. Hence the
volume of the unit cell is 0 .02355 nm

ﬁrst impressions, the bcc cell contains two atoms, i.e.

relative atomic mass of iron. The theoretical density
(mass/volume) is thus 7875 kg m/NUL3. The reason for
the slight discrepancy between this value and the
experimentally-determined value of 7870 kg m/NUL3will
become evident when we discuss crystal imperfections
in Chapter 4.
2.5.2 Diamond and graphite
It isremarkable thata singleelement, carbon, can existin two such different crystalline forms as diamondand graphite. Diamond is transparent and one of the

It does not refer to mass andhas been likened to terms such as dozen, score, gross, etc.By deﬁnition, it is the amount of substance which containsas many elementary units as there are atoms in 0.012 kg ofcarbon-12.

We can now progress from the earlier representation
of the diamond structure (Figure 1.3c) to a more real-
istic version. Although the structure consists of two
interpenetrating fcc sub-structures, in which one sub-structure is slightly displaced along the body diagonalof the other, it is sufﬁcient for our purpose to concen-trate on a representative structure cell (Figure 2.13a).Eachcarbonatomiscovalentlybondedtofourequidis-

tetrahedra acted as obstacles on fortiﬁed Normandy beaches
in World War II.

22Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Graphite is less dense and more stable than dia-
mond.Indirectcontrasttothecross-bracedstructureofdiamond, graphite has a highly anisotropic layer struc-ture (Figure 2.13b). Adjacent layers in the ABABAB
sequence are staggered; the structure is not cph. Alessstablerhombohedral ABCABC sequencehasbeen
observed in natural graphite. Charcoal, soot and lamp-black have been termed ‘amorphous carbon’; actuallythey are microcrystalline forms of graphite. Covalent-
bonded carbon atoms, 0.1415 nm apart, are arranged
in layers of hexagonal symmetry. These layers areapproximately 0.335 nm apart. This distance is rel-atively large and the interlayer forces are thereforeweak. Layers can be readily sheared past each other,thus explaining the lubricity of graphitic carbon. (Analternative solid lubricant, molybdenum disulphide,MoS
2, has a similar layered structure.).
The ratio of property values parallel to the a-axis
and the c-axis is known as the anisotropy ratio. (For
cubic crystals, the ratio is unity.) Special synthesis
techniques can produce near-ideal graphite1with an
anisotropy ratio of thermal conductivity of 200.
2.5.3 Coordination in ionic crystals
We have seen in the case of diamond how the joiningof four carbon atoms outlines a tetrahedron which issmaller than the structure cell (Figure 2.13a). Beforeexamining some selected ionic compounds, it is neces-sary to develop this aspect of coordination more fully.This approach to structure-building concerns packingand is essentially a geometrical exercise. It is sub-ordinate to the more dominant demands of covalent
bonding.
Intheﬁrstofasetofconditionalrules,assembledby

1Applications range from rocket nozzles to bowl linings for
tobacco pipes.electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus;
consequently, cations are usually smaller than anions.
Rule 1states that the coordination of anions around
a reference cation is determined by the geometrynecessary for the cation to remain in contact witheach anion. For instance, in Figure 2.14a, a radiusratio r/Rof 0.155 signiﬁes touching contact when
three anions are grouped about a cation. This criticalvalue is readily derived by geometry. If the r/Rratio
for threefold coordination is less than 0.155 then thecation ‘rattles’ in the central interstice, or ‘hole’, andthearrangementisunstable.As r/Rexceeds0.155then
structural distortion begins to develop.
In the next case, that of fourfold coordination,
the ‘touching’ ratio has a value of 0.225 andjoining of the anion centres deﬁnes a tetrahedron(Figure 2.14b). For example, silicon and oxygen ionshave radii of 0.039 nm and 0.132 nm, respectively,hence r/RD0.296. This value is slightly greater than
thecriticalvalueof0.225anditfollowsthattetrahedralcoordination gives a stable conﬁguration; indeed, the
complex anion SiO
44/NULis the key structural feature
of silica, silicates and silica glasses. The quadruplenegative charge is due to the four unsatisﬁed oxygenbonds which project from the group.
In a feature common to many structures, the
tendency for anions to distance themselves from eachotherasmuchaspossibleisbalancedbytheirattractiontowards the central cation. Each of the four oxygenanions is only linked by one of its two bonds tothe silicon cation, giving an effective silicon/oxygenratio of 1:2 and thus conﬁrming the stoichiometric
chemical formula for silica, SiO
2. Finally, as shown in
Figure 2.14c, the next coordination polyhedron is anoctahedronforwhich r/RD0.414.Itfollowsthateach
degree of coordination is associated with a nominalrange of r/Rvalues, as shown in Table 2.2. Caution
is necessary in applying these ideas of geometricalpacking because (1) range limits are approximative,(2) ionic radii are very dependent upon CN, (3) ionscan be non-spherical in anisotropic crystals and

(4) considerations of covalent or metallic bonding can
be overriding. The other four Pauling rules are as
follows:
Rule II. In a stable coordinated structure the total
valency of the anion equals the summated bond
strengths of the valency bonds which extend to thisanion from all neighbouring cations. Bond strength is
deﬁned as the valency of an ion divided by the actual
number of bonds; thus, for Si

nation it is4
4D1. This valuable rule, which expresses
thetendencyof eachiontoachieve localizedneutrality
by surrounding itself with ions of opposite charge, is
useful in deciding the arrangement of cations aroundan anion. For instance, the important ceramic barium

Rule III. An ionic structure tends to have maxi-
mum stability when its coordination polyhedra share
corners; edge- and face-sharing give less stability.Any
arrangement which brings the mutually-repelling cen-tral cations closer together tends to destabilize thestructure. Cations of high valency (charge) and low
CN (poor‘shielding’bysurroundinganions)aggravate
the destabilizing tendency.
Rule IV. In crystals containing different types of
cation, cations of high valency and low CN tend to
limit the sharing of polyhedra elements; for instance,such cations favour corner-sharing rather than edge-
sharing.
Rule V.If several alternative forms of coordination
are possible, one form usually applies throughout thestructure. In this way, ions of a given type are more
likely to have identical surroundings.

Figure 2.15 Zinc blende ( ˛-ZnS) structure, prototype for
cubic boron nitride (BN) (from Kingery, Bowen and
Uhlmann, 1976; by permission of Wiley-Interscience) .
The structure of the mineral zinc blende ( ˛-ZnS)
shown in Figure 2.15 is often quoted as a prototype
for other structures. In accord with the radius ratio
r/RD0.074/0.184D0.4, tetrahedral coordination is
a feature of its structure. Coordination tetrahedra
share only corners (vertices). Thus one species of ion
occupies four of the eight tetrahedral sites within the
cell. These sites have been mentioned previously in
connection with diamond (Section 2.5.2); in that case,
the directional demands of the covalent bonds between
like carbon atoms determined their location. In zinc
sulphide, the position of unlike ions is determined by
geometrical packing. Replacement of the Zn2Cand
S2/NULions in the prototype cell with boron and nitrogen

(BN). This compound is extremely hard and refractory
and, because of the adjacency of boron ⊿ZD5/triangleleftand
nitrogen ⊿ZD7/triangleleftto carbon ⊿ZD6/triangleleftin the Periodic
Table, is more akin in character to diamond than to
zinc sulphide. Its angular crystals serve as an excellent
grinding abrasive for hardened steel. The precursor for
cubic boron nitride is the more common and readily-
prepared form, hexagonal boron nitride.1
This hexagonal form is obtained by replacing
the carbon atoms in the layered graphite structure
(Figure 2.13b) alternately with boron and nitrogen
atoms and also slightly altering the stacking registry
of the layer planes. It feels slippery like graphite and

is sometimes called ‘white graphite’. Unlike graphite,
it is an insulator, having no free electrons.
Anotherabrasive medium, siliconcarbide(SiC), can
be represented in one of its several crystalline forms
by the zinc blende structure. Silicon and carbon are

Figure 2.16 AB-type compounds (from Kingery, Bowen and
Uhlmann, 1976; by permission of Wiley-Interscience) .Generically, MgO is a sodium chloride-type struc-
ture (Figure 2.16a), with Mg2Ccations and O2/NULanions
occupying two interpenetrating1fcc sub-lattices. Many
oxides and halides have this type of structure (e.g.CaO, SrO, BaO, VO, CdO, MnO, FeO, CoO, NiO;NaCl, NaBr, NaI, NaF, KCl, etc.). The ratio of ionicradii r/RD0.065/0.140D0.46 and, as indicated by
Table 2.2, each Mg
2Ccation is octahedrally coordi-
nated with six larger O2/NULanions, and vice versa
⊿CND6:6/triangleleft. Octahedra of a given type share edges.
The‘molecular ’formula MgO indicates that there is
an exact stoichiometric balance between the numbersof cations and anions; more speci ﬁcally, the unit cell
depicted contains ⊿8ð

2/triangleleftD4 cations and
⊿12ð1

The second example of an AB-type compound
is the hard intermetallic compound CuZn ( ˇ-brass)
shown in Figure 2.16b. It has a caesium chloride-type structure in which two simple cubic sub-latticesinterpenetrate. Copper ⊿ZD29/triangleleftand zinc ⊿ZD30/triangleleft
have similar atomic radii. Each copper atom is in
eightfold coordination with zinc atoms; thus CN D
8:8. The coordination cubes share faces. Each unitcell contains ⊿8ð
1
8/triangleleftD1 corner atom and 1 central
atom; hence the formula CuZn. In other words, this
compound contains 50 at.% copper and 50 at.% zinc.
2.5.5 Silica
Compounds of the AB 2-type (stoichiometric ratio
1:2) form a very large group comprising manydifferent types of structure. We will concentrate upon
ˇ-cristobalite, which, as Table 2.3 shows, is the high-
temperature modi ﬁcation of one of the three principal
forms in which silica ⊿SiO
2/triangleleftexists. Silica is a
refractory ceramic which is widely used in the steeland glass industries. Silica bricks are prepared by kiln-
ﬁring quartz of low impurity content at a temperature
of 1450
°C, thereby converting at least 98.5% of it
into a mixture of the more ‘open’, less dense forms,
tridymite and cristobalite. The term ‘conversion ’is
equivalent to that of allotropic transformation in
metallic materials and refers to a transformation which
is reconstructive in character, involving the breakingand re-establishment of inter-atomic bonds. Thesesolid-state changes are generally rather sluggish and,as a consequence, crystal structures frequently persist
in a metastable condition at temperatures outside
the nominal ranges of stability given in Table 2.3.Transformationsfromonemodi ﬁcationtoanotheronly
involve displacement of bonds and reorientation of
bond directions; they are known as inversions. As
these changes are comparatively limited in range,they are usually quite rapid and reversible. However,the associated volume change can be substantial. Forexample, the ˛!ˇtransition in cristobalite at a

array of like atoms (ions) in turn.

temperature of 270 °C is accompanied by a volume
increase of 3% which is capable of disrupting thestructure of a silica brick or shape. In order to avoidthis type of thermal stress cracking, it is necessaryto either heat or cool silica structures very slowly at
temperatures below 700
°C (e.g. at 20 °Ch/NUL1). Above
this temperature level, the structure is resilient and, as
a general rule, it is recommended that silica refractorybe kept above a temperature of 700
°C during its
entire working life. Overall, the structural behaviourof silica during kiln- ﬁring and subsequent service is
a complicated subject,
1particularly as the presence
of other substances can either catalyse or hindertransformations.
Substances which promote structural change in
ceramics are known as mineralizers (e.g. calciumoxide (CaO)). The opposite effect can be producedby associated substances in the microstructure; forinstance, an encasing envelope of glassy materialcan inhibit the cooling inversion of a small volumeofˇ-cristobalite by opposing the associated contrac-
tion. The pronounced metastability of cristobalite and
tridymite at relatively low temperatures is usuallyattributed to impurity atoms which, by their pres-ence in the interstices, buttress these ‘open’structures
andinhibitconversions.However, irrespectiveof these
complications, corner-sharing SiO
44/NULtetrahedra, with
their short-range order, are a common feature of allthese crystalline modi ﬁcations of silica; the essential
difference between modi ﬁcations is therefore one of
long-range ordering. We will use the example of theˇ-cristobalite structure to expand the idea of these ver-
satile tetrahedral building units. (Later we will see thatthey also act as building units in the very large familyof silicates.)
In the essentially ionic structure of ˇ-cristobalite
(Figure 2.17) small Si
4Ccations are located in a cubic
arrangement which is identical to that of diamond. The
muchlargerO2/NULanionsformSiO 44/NULtetrahedraaround
each of the four occupied tetrahedral sites in such a
waythateachSi4Cliesequidistantbetweentwoanions.
1The fact that cristobalite forms at a kiln- ﬁring temperature
which is below 1470 °C illustrates the complexity of the
structural behaviour of commercial-quality silica.
Figure 2.17 Structure of ˇ-cristobalite (from Kingery,
Bowen and Uhlmann, 1976; by permission of
Wiley-Interscience) .
The structure thus forms a regular network of corner-
sharing tetrahedra. The coordination of anions arounda cation is clearly fourfold; coordination around each
anion can be derived by applying Pauling ’s Rule III.
Thus, CN D4:2 neatly summarizes the coordination
inˇ-cristobalite. Oxygen anions obviously occupy
muchmorevolumethancationsandconsequentlytheir
grouping in space determines the essential character
of the structure. In other words, the radius ratio isrelatively small. As the anion and cation becomeprogressively more similar in size in some of the other
AB
2-typecompounds,thepairedcoordinationnumbers
take values of 6:3 and then 8:4. These paired valuesrelate to structure groups for which rutile ⊿TiO
2/triangleleftand
ﬂuorite ⊿CaF2/triangleleft, respectively, are commonly quoted
as prototypes. AB 2-type compounds have their alloy
counterparts and later, in Chapter 3, we will examinein some detail a unique and important family of alloys(e.g. MgCu
2,MgNi2,MgZn2, etc.). In these so-called
Laves phases, two dissimilar types of atoms pack so
closely that the usual coordination maximum of 12,which is associated with equal-sized atoms, is actuallyexceeded.

Smallman and Haworth, 1988) .
2.5.6 Alumina
Alumina exists in two forms: ˛-Al2O3and/CR-Al2O3.
The former, often referred to by its mineral namecorundum, serves as a prototypefor other ionic oxides,such as ˛-Fe
2O3(haematite), Cr 2O3,V2O3,T i2O3,
etc. The structure of ˛-Al2O3(Figure 2.18) can be
visualized as layers of close-packed O2/NULanions with
anABABAB ...sequence in which two-thirds of the
octahedral holes or interstices are ﬁlled symmetrically
with smaller Al3Ccations. Coordination is accordingly
6:4. This partial ﬁlling gives the requisite stoichiomet-ric ratio of ions. The structure is not truly cph becauseall the octahedral sites are not ﬁlled.
˛-A
2O3is the form of greatest engineering inter-
est. The other term, /CR-Al2O3, refers collectively to a
number of variants which have O2/NULanions in an fcc
arrangement. As before, Al3Ccations ﬁll two-thirds of
the octahedral holes to give a structure which is con-veniently regarded as a ‘defect’ spinel structure with
a deﬁcit, or shortage, of Al
3Ccations; spinels will be
described in Section 2.5.7. /CR-Al2O3has very useful
adsorptive and catalytic properties and is sometimesreferred to as ‘activated alumina’, illustratingyet againthewayinwhichstructuraldifferenceswithinthesamecompound can produce very different properties.
2.5.7 Complex oxides
The ABO 3-type compounds, for which the mineral
perovskite ⊿CaTiO 3/triangleleftis usually quoted as prototype,
form an interesting and extremely versatile family.
Barium titanium oxide1⊿BaTiO 3/trianglelefthas been studied
extensively, leading to the development of impor-tant synthetic compounds, notably the new genera-
tion of ceramic superconductors.
2It is polymorphic,
1The structure does not contain discrete TiO 32/NULanionic
groups; hence, strictly speaking, it is incorrect to imply that
the compound is an inorganic salt by referring to it asbarium ‘titanate’.
2K. A. Muller and J. G. Bednorz, IBM Zurich Research
Laboratory, based their researches upon perovskite-type
structures. In 1986 they produced a complex
Figure 2.19 Unit cell of cubic BaTiO3⊿CND6:12/triangleleft(from
Kingery, Bowen and Uhlmann, 1976; by permission ofWiley-Interscience) .
exhibiting at least four temperature-dependent transi-
tions. The cubic form, which is stable at temperatures
below 120 °C, is shown in Figure 2.19. The large bar-
ium cations are located in the ‘holes’, or interstices,
between the regularly stacked titanium-centred oxy-
gen octahedra. Each barium cation is at the centre ofa polyhedron formed by twelve oxygen anions. (Coor-
dination in this structure was discussed in terms of
Pauling’s Rule II in Section 2.5.3).
Above the ferroelectric Curie point (120
°C), the
cubic unit cell of BaTiO 3becomes tetragonal as
Ti4Ccations and O2/NULanions move in opposite
directions parallel to an axis of symmetry. This
slight displacement of approximately 0.005 nm is
accompanied by a change in axial ratio ( c/a) from
unity to 1.04. The new structure develops a dipole
of electric charge as it becomes less symmetrical; it
also exhibits marked ferroelectric characteristics. The
electrical and magnetic properties of perovskite-type
structures will be explored in Chapter 6.
Inorganic compounds with structures similar to that

an extraordinarily versatile range of materials (e.g.
watch bearings, refractories). Numerous alternative
combinations of ions are possible. Normal versions
of these mixed oxides are usually represented by the
general formula AB 2O4; however, other combinations
of the two dissimilar cations, A and B, are also
super-conducting oxide of lanthanum, barium and copper
which had the unprecedentedly-high critical temperature of35 K.
Atomic arrangements in materials 27
possible. Terms such as II-III spinels, II-IV spinels
and I-VI spinels have been adopted to indicate
the valencies of the ﬁrst two elements in theformula; respective examples being Mg
2CAl23CO42/NUL,
Mg22CGe4CO42/NULand Ag21CMo6CO42/NUL. In each spinel
formula, thetotalcationiccharge balancesthe negativecharge of the oxygen anions. (Analogous series ofcompounds are formed when the divalent oxygen
anions are completely replaced by elements from
the same group of the Periodic Table, i.e. sulphur,selenium and tellurium.)
The principle of substitution is a useful device for
explaining the various forms of spinel structure.
Thus, in the case of II-III spinels, the Mg
2Ccations
of the reference spinel structure MgAl2O4can be
replaced by Fe2C,Z n2C,N i2Cand Mn2Cand virtu-
ally any trivalent cation can replace Al3Cions (e.g.
Fe3C,Cr3C,Mn3C,Ti3C,V3C,rareearthions,etc.).The
scope for extreme diversity is immediately apparent.The cubic unit cell, or true repeat unit, of the II-
III prototype MgAl
2O4comprises eight fcc sub-cells
and, overall, contains 32 oxygen anions in almost per-fectfccarrangement.Thecharge-compensatingcationsare distributed among the tetrahedral ⊿CND4/triangleleftand
octahedral ⊿CND6/triangleleftinterstices of these anions. (Each
individualfccsub-cellhaseighttetrahedralsiteswithinit, as explained for diamond, and 12 octahedral ‘holes’
located midway along each of the cube edges.) One
eighth of the 64 tetrahedral ‘holes’ of the large unit
cell are occupied by Mg
2Ccations and one half of the
32 octahedral ‘holes’ are occupied by Al3Ccations.
A similar distribution of divalent and trivalent cationsoccurs in other normal II-III spinels e.g. MgCr
2O4,
ZnCr2Se4. Most spinels are of the II-III type.
Ferrospinels (‘ferrites’), such as NiFe 2O4and
CoFe2O4, form an ‘inverse’ type of spinel structure
in which the allocation of cations to tetrahedral and
octahedral sites tends to change over, producing sig-
niﬁcant and useful changes in physical characteristics(e.g. magnetic and electrical properties). The generic
formula for ‘inverse’ spinels takes the form B(AB)O
4,
with the parentheses indicating the occupancy of octa-hedral sites by both types of cation. In this ‘inverse’arrangement, B cations rather than A cations occupy
tetrahedral sites. In the case of the two ferrospinels
named, ‘inverse’ structures develop during slow cool-ing from sintering heat-treatment. In the ﬁrst spinel,
which we can now write as Fe
3C⊿Ni2CFe3C/triangleleftO4,h a l fo f
theFe3Ccationsareintetrahedralsites.Theremainder,
together with all Ni2Ccations, enter octahedral sites.
Typically, these compounds respond to the conditionsof heat-treatment: rapid cooling after sintering willaffect the distribution of cations and produce a struc-
ture intermediate to the limiting normal and inverse
forms. The partitioning among cation sites is oftenquantiﬁedintermsofthedegreeofinversion ⊿/NAK/triangleleftwhich
states the fraction of B cations occupying tetrahedral
sites. Hence, for normal and inverse spinels respec-
tively, /NAKD0a n d /NAKD0.5. Intermediate values of /NAKbetween these limits are possible. Magnetite, the nav-
igational aid of early mariners, is an inverse spinel
and has the formula Fe
3C⊿Fe2CFe3C/triangleleftO4and/NAKD0.5.
Fe3C⊿Mg2CFe3C/triangleleftO4isknowntohavea /NAKvalueof0.45.
Its structure is therefore not wholly inverse, but this
formula notation does convey structural information.
Other, more empirical, notations are sometimes used;for instance, this particular spinel is sometimes repre-sented by the formulae MgFe
2O4and MgO.Fe2O3.
2.5.8 Silicates
Silicate minerals are the predominant minerals in the
earth’s crust, silicon and oxygen being the most abun-
dant chemical elements. They exhibit a remarkablediversity of properties. Early attempts to classify themin terms of bulk chemical analysis and concepts of
acidity/basicity failed to provide an effective and con-
vincing frame of reference. An emphasis upon stoi-chiometry led to the practice of representing silicates
by formulae stating the thermodynamic components.
Thus two silicates which are encountered in refrac-tories science, forsterite and mullite, are sometimesrepresented by the ‘molecular’ formulae 2MgO.SiO
2
and 3Al 2O3.2SiO2. (A further step, often adopted in
phase diagram studies, is to codify them as M 2Sa n d
A3S2, respectively.) However, as will be shown, the
summated counterparts of the above formulae, namely
Mg2SiO4and Al 6Si2O13, provide some indication of
ionic grouping and silicate type. In keeping with thisemphasisuponstructure,thecharacterizationofceram-
ics usually centres upon techniques such as X-ray
diffraction analysis, with chemical analyses making acomplementary, albeit essential, contribution.
The SiO
4tetrahedron previously described in the
discussion of silica (Section 2.5.5) provides a highly
effective key to the classiﬁcation of the numeroussilicate materials, natural and synthetic. From each ofthefourcorneranionsprojectsabondwhichissatisﬁed
by either (1) an adjacent cation, such as Mg
2C,F e2C,
Fe3C,C a2Cetc., or (2) by the formation of ‘oxygen
bridges’ between vertices of tetrahedra. In the latter
case an increased degree of cornersharing leads fromstructures in which isolated tetrahedra exist to those inwhich tetrahedra are arranged in pairs, chains, sheets
or frameworks (Table 2.4). Let us brieﬂy consider
some examples of this structural method of classifyingsilicates.
In the nesosilicates, isolated SiO
44/NULtetrahedra are
studded in a regular manner throughout the structure.Zircon (zirconium silicate) has the formula ZrSiO
4
which displays the characteristic silicon/oxygen ratio
(1:4) of a nesosilicate. (It is used for the refractory
kiln furniture which supports ceramic ware duringthe ﬁring process.) The large family of nesosilicateminerals known as olivines has a generic formula
⊿Mg,Fe/triangleleft
2SiO4, which indicates that the negatively-
charged tetrahedra are balanced electrically by either

Mg2Cor Fe2Ccations. This substitution, or replace-
ment, among the available cation sites of the struc-
ture forms a solid solution.1This means that the
composition of an olivine can lie anywhere betweenthe compositions of the two end-members, forsterite(Mg
2SiO4) and fayalite ⊿Fe2SiO4/triangleleft. The difference in
high-temperature performance of these two varieties
of olivine is striking; white forsterite (m.p. 1890 °C)
is a useful refractory whereas brown/black fayalite(m.p. 1200
°C), which sometimes forms by interac-
tion between certain refractory materials and a molten
furnace charge, is weakening and undesirable. Substi-
tution commonly occurs in non-metallic compounds(e.g. spinels). Variations in its form and extent can beconsiderableanditisoftenfoundthatsamplescanvary

(Garnet is extremely hard and is used as an abrasive.)
Certain asbestos minerals are important examples of
inosilicates. Their unique ﬁbrous character, or asbesti-
form habit, can be related to the structural disposition
of SiO 44/NULtetrahedra. These impure forms of mag-
nesium silicate are remarkable for their low thermal
conductivity and thermal stability. However, all forms
of asbestos break down into simpler components when
heated in the temperature range 600–1000 °C. The
principal source materials are:
Amosite (brown ⊿Fe22CMg/triangleleft7⊿Si4O11/triangleleft2⊿OH/triangleleft4
asbestos)
Crocidolite (blue Na 2Fe23C⊿Fe2CMg/triangleleft3⊿Si4O11/triangleleft2⊿OH/triangleleft4
asbestos)
Chrysotile (white Mg3Si2O5⊿OH/triangleleft4
asbestos)
Atomic arrangements in materials 29
These chemical formulae are idealized. Amosite and
crocidolite belong to the amphibole group of minerals
in which SiO 44/NULtetrahedra are arranged in double-
strand linear chains (Table 2.4). The term ⊿Si4O11/triangleleft
represents the repeat unit in the chain which is four
tetrahedra wide. Being hydrous minerals, hydroxylions ⊿OH/triangleleft
/NULare interspersed among the tetrahedra.
Bands of cations separate the chains and, in a rather
general sense, we can understand why these structures
cleave to expose characteristic thread-like fracture
surfaces. Each thread is a bundle of solid ﬁbrils or
ﬁlaments, 20–200 nm in breadth. The length/diameter
ratiovariesbutistypically100:1.Amphiboleﬁbresare
used for high-temperature insulation and have usefulacid resistance; however, they are brittle and inﬂexible
(‘harsh’) and are therefore difﬁcult to spin into yarn
and weave. In marked contrast, chrysotile ﬁbres are
strong and ﬂexible and have been used speciﬁcally for
woven asbestos articles, for friction surfaces and for
asbestos/cement composites. Chrysotile belongs to the
serpentineclassofmineralsinwhichSiO
44/NULtetrahedra
are arranged in sheets or layers. It therefore appears
paradoxical for it to have a ﬁbrous fracture. High-
resolution electron microscopy solved the problem by
showing that chrysotile ﬁbrils, sectioned transversely,
were hollow tubes in which the structural layers werecurved and arranged either concentrically or as scrolls
parallel to the major axis of the tubular ﬁbril.
Sincethe1970sconsiderableattentionhasbeenpaid
to the biological hazards associated with the manufac-
ture, processing and use of asbestos-containing mate-
rials. It has proved to be a complicated and highly
emotive subject. Minute ﬁbrils of asbestos are readilyairborneandcancauserespiratorydiseases(asbestosis)
and cancer. Crocidolite dust is particularly dangerous.
Permissible atmospheric concentrations and safe han-
dling procedures have been prescribed. Encapsulation
and/or coating of ﬁbres is recommended. Alternativematerials are being sought but it is difﬁcult to match
the unique properties of asbestos. For instance, glassy
‘wool’ ﬁbres have been produced on a commercial
scale by rapidly solidifying molten rock but they do
not have the thermal stability, strength and ﬂexibil-
ity of asbestos. Asbestos continues to be widely used
by the transportation and building industries. Asbestostextiles serve in protective clothing, furnace curtains,
pipe wrapping, ablative nose cones for rockets, and
conveyorsformoltenglass.Asbestosisusedinfriction
components,
1gaskets, gland packings, joints, pump
seals, etc. In composite asbestos cloth/phenolic resinform, it is used for bearings, bushes, liners and aero-
engine heat shields. Cement reinforced with asbestos
ﬁbres is used for rooﬁng, cladding and for pressure
pipes which distribute potable water.
1Dust from asbestos friction components, such as brake
linings, pads and clutches of cars, can contain 1–2% ofasbestos ﬁbres and should be removed by vacuum or dampcloth rather than by blasts of compressed air.The white mineral kaolinite is an important example
of the many complex silicates which have a layered
structure, i.e. Si:O D2:5. As indicated previously, in
thediscussionofspinels,atomicgrouping(s)withinthe
structuralformulacanindicateactualstructuralgroups.Thus,kaoliniteisrepresentedbyAl
2Si2O5⊿OH/triangleleft4rather
than by Al 2O3.2SiO2.2H2O, an older notation which
uses ‘waters of crystallization’ and disregards the sig-
niﬁcant role of hydroxyl OH/NULions. Sometimes the
formulaiswrittenas[Al 2Si2O5⊿OH/triangleleft4]2inordertogive
a truer picture of the repeat cell. Kaolinite is the com-
monest clay mineral and its small crystals form the
major constituent of kaolin (china-clay), the rock that
is a primary raw material of the ceramics industry. (Itisalsousedforﬁllingandcoatingpaper.)Claysare the
sedimentary products of the weathering of rocks and
when one considers the possible variety of geologicalorigins, the opportunities for the acquisition of impu-
rity elements and the scope for ionic replacement it is
not surprising to ﬁnd that the compositions and struc-tures of clay minerals show considerable variations.
To quote one practical instance, only certain clays, the
so-called ﬁreclays, are suitable for manufacture intorefractory ﬁrebricks for furnace construction.
Structurally, kaolinite provides a useful insight into
the arrangement of ions in layered silicates. Essen-
tially the structure consists of ﬂat layers, several
ions thick. Figure 2.20 shows, in section, adjacentvertically-stackedlayersofkaolinite,eachlayerhaving
ﬁve sub-layers or sheets. The lower side of each layer
consistsofSiO
44/NULtetrahedraarrangedhexagonallyina

are joined by ‘oxygen bridges’ and lie in the lower-most face; the remaining vertices all point upwards.
The central Si4Ccations of the tetrahedra form the sec-
ond sub-layer. The upward-pointing vertices, together
with OH/NULions, form the close-packed third sub-layer.
Al3Ccations occupy some of the octahedral ‘holes’
⊿CND6/triangleleftbetween this third layer and a ﬁfth close-
packed layer of OH/NULions. The coordination of each

aluminium cation with two oxygen ions and four
hydroxyl ions forms an octahedron, i.e. AlO 2⊿OH/triangleleft4.
Thus, in each layer, a sheet of SiO 44/NULtetrahedra lies
parallel to a sheet of AlO 2⊿OH/triangleleft4octahedra, with the
two sheets sharing common O2/NULanions. Strong ionic
andcovalentbondingexistswithineach layer andeach
layer is electrically neutral. However, the uneven dis-
tributionofionicchargeacrosstheﬁvesub-layershasa
polarizing effect, causing opposed changes to developon the two faces of the layer. The weak van der Waals
bonding between layers is thus explicable. This asym-
metry of ionic structure also unbalances the bonding
forces and encourages cleavage within the layer itself.
In general terms, one can understand the softness, easy
cleavage and mouldability (after moistening) of this
mineral. The ionic radii of oxygen and hydroxyl ions
are virtually identical. The much smaller Al
3Ccations
are shown located outside the SiO 44/NULtetrahedra. How-
ever, the radii ratio for aluminium and oxygen ions is
very close to the geometrical boundary value of 0.414
and it is possible in other aluminosilicates for Al3C
cations to replace Si4Ccations at the centres of oxygen
tetrahedra. In such structures, ions of different valencyenter the structure in order to counterbalance the local
decreases in positive charge. To summarize, the coor-
dination of aluminium in layered aluminosilicates can
be either four- or sixfold.
Many variations in layer structure are possible in
silicates. Thus, talc (French chalk), Mg
3Si4O10⊿OH/triangleleft2,
has similar physical characteristics to kaolinite and
ﬁnds use as a solid lubricant. In talc, each layer con-
sists of alternating Mg2Cand OH/NULions interspersed
betweentheinwardly-pointingverticesoftwosheetsof
SiO44/NULtetrahedra. Thistetrahedral-tetrahedrallayering
thus contrasts with the tetrahedral-octahedral layering
of kaolinite crystals.
Finally, in our brief survey of silicates, we come to
the framework structures in which the SiO 44/NULtetrahe-
dra share all four corners and form an extended and
regular three-dimensional network. Feldspars, whicharemajor constituentsinigneousrocks,arefairlycom-
pact but other framework silicates, such as the zeolites
and ultramarine, have unusually ‘open’ structures with
tunnels and/or polyhedral cavities. Natural and syn-
thetic zeolites form a large and versatile family of
compounds. As in other framework silicates, many of
the central sites of the oxygen tetrahedra are occupied
by Al
3Ccations. The negatively charged framework of
⊿Si,Al/triangleleftO4tetrahedraisbalancedbyassociatedcations;
being cross-braced in three dimensions,the structure is
rigid and stable. The overall ⊿Al3CCSi4C/triangleleft:O2/NULratio
is always 1:2 for zeolites. In their formulae, ⊿H2O/triangleleft
appears as a separate term, indicating that these water
molecules are loosely bound. In fact, they can be read-

and can also be re-absorbed. Alternatively, dehydrated
zeolites can be used to absorb gases, such as carbondioxide ⊿CO2/triangleleftand ammonia ⊿NH3/triangleleft. Zeolites are well-
known for their ion-exchange capacity1but synthetic
resins now compete in this application. Ion exchangecan be accompanied by appreciable absorption so thatthenumberofcationsenteringthezeoliticstructurecan

Dehydrated zeolites have a large surface/mass ratio,
like many other catalysts, and are used to promotereactions in the petrochemical industry. Zeolites canalsoserveas‘molecularsieves’.Bycontrollingthesizeof the connecting tunnel system within the structure, it
is possible to separate molecules of different size from

2.6 Inorganic glasses
2.6.1 Network structures in glasses
Having examined a selection of important crystallinestructures, we now turn to the less-ordered glassystructures. Boric oxide (B
2O3; m.p. 460 °C) is one of
the relatively limited number of oxides that can existin either a crystalline or a glassy state. Figure 2.1,which was used earlier to illustrate the concept of
ordering (Section 2.1), portrays in a schematic man-
ner the two structural forms of boric oxide. In thisﬁgure, each planar triangular group ⊿CND3/triangleleftrepre-
sents three oxygen anions arranged around a much
smaller B
3Ccation. Collectively, the triangles form
a random network in three dimensions. Similar mod-
elling can be applied to silica (m.p. 1725 °C), the most
important and common glass-forming oxide. In silica
glass, SiO 44/NULtetrahedra form a three-dimensional net-
workwithoxygen‘bridges’joiningvertices.Likeboricoxide glass, the ‘open’ structure contains many ‘holes’
of irregular shape. The equivalent of metallic alloying
is achieved by basing a glass upon a combination oftwoglass-formers, silicaandboricoxide.Theresultingnetwork consists of triangular and tetrahedral anionicgroups and, as might be anticipated, is less cohesiveand rigid than a pure SiO
2network. B 2O3therefore
has a ﬂuxing action. By acting as a network-former, it
also has less effect upon thermal expansivity than con-
ventional ﬂuxes, such as Na 2Oa n dK 2O, which break
up the network. The expansion characteristics can thusbe adjusted by control of the B
2O3/Na2O ratio.
Apart from chemical composition, the main variable
controlling glass formation from oxides is the rate of
cooling from the molten or fused state. Slow cooling
provides ample time for complete ordering of atomsandgroupsofatoms.Rapidcoolingrestrictsthisphysi-
calprocessandthereforefavoursglassformation.

regenerated by contact with brine (NaCl) solution.

carefully arranged bricks (crystal) and a disordered heap ofbricks (glass).
Atomic arrangements in materials 31
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
deﬁnes glass as an inorganic product of fusion that has
cooled to a rigid condition without crystallizing. The
cooling rate can be inﬂuenced by a ‘mass effect’ with
the chances of glass formation increasing as the size
of particle or cross-section decreases. Accordingly, a
more precise deﬁnition of a glass-former might also
specify a minimum mass, say 20 mg, and free-cooling
of the melt. As a consequence of their irregular andaperiodic network structures, glasses share certain dis-
tinctive characteristics. They are isotropic and have
properties that change gradually with changing tem-
perature. Bond strengths vary from region to region
within the network so that the application of stress at
an elevated temperature causes viscous deformation or
ﬂow. This remarkable ability to change shape without
fractureisusedtomaximumadvantageinthespinning,
drawing, rolling, pressing and blowing operations of
the glass industry (e.g. production of ﬁlaments, tubes,
sheets, shapes and containers). Glasses do not cleave,because there are no crystallographic planes, and frac-
turetoproducenewsurfacesthatare smoothandshell-
like (conchoidal). It is usually impossible to represent
a glass by a stoichiometric formula. Being essentially
metastable, the structure of a glass can change with
the passage of time. Raising the temperature increases
ionic mobility and hastens this process, being some-
times capable of inducing the nucleation and growth
of crystalline regions within the glassy matrix. Con-trolled devitriﬁcation of special glasses produces the
heat- and fracture-resistant materials known as glass-
ceramics (Section 10.4.4). Finally, glasses lack a deﬁ-
nite melting point. This feature is apparent when spe-
ciﬁc volume ⊿m
3kg/NUL1/triangleleft, or a volume-related property,
is plotted against temperature for the crystalline and
glassy forms of a given substance (Figure 2.21). Oncooling, the melt viscosity rapidly increases. Simul-
taneously, the speciﬁc volume decreases as a result
of normal thermal contraction and contraction due to
structural (conﬁgurational) rearrangement within the
liquid. After supercooling below the crystalline melt-
ing point, a curved inﬂexion over a temperature range
of roughly 50
°C marks the decrease and eventual ces-
sation of structural rearrangement. The ﬁnal portion
of the curve, of lesser slope, represents normal ther-mal contraction of the rigid glass structure. The ﬁctive
(imagined)temperature T
fshowninFigure 2.21serves
as an indexof transition;however, itincreases in value
as the cooling rate is increased. Being disordered, a
glass has a lower density than its corresponding crys-
talline form.
2.6.2 Classiﬁcation of constituent oxides
After considering the relation of oxides to glass struc-
ture, Zachariasen categorized oxides as (1) network-
formers, (2) intermediates and (3) network-modiﬁers.
Oxides other than boric oxide and silica have the
ability to form network structures. They are listed in

This particular method of classiﬁcation primarily
concerns the glass-forming ability of an oxide; thusoxides classed as network-modiﬁers have little or no
tendency to form network structures. Modiﬁers can
have very important practical effects. For instance, thealkali-metal oxides of sodium and potassium are usedto modify the glasses based on silica which account
for 90% of commercial glass production. Sodium car-

2.7.1 Thermoplastics
Having examined the key role of silicon in crystalline
silicatesandglasses,wenowturntoanothertetravalentelement, carbon, and examine its central contributionto the organic structures known as polymers, or, in a
moregeneralcommercialsense,‘plastics’.Thesestruc-
tures are based upon long-chain molecules and can bebroadly classiﬁed in behavioural terms as thermoplas-tics, elastomers and thermosets. In order to illustrate
somegeneralprinciplesof‘molecularengineering’,we
will ﬁrst consider polyethylene (PE), a linear thermo-plastic which can be readily shaped by a combinationof heat and pressure. Its basic repeat unit of struc-
ture (mer) is derived from the ethene, or ethylene,
2
molecule C 2H4and has a relative mer mass Mmonof
28,i.e. ⊿12ð2/triangleleftC⊿1ð4/triangleleft.Thismonomerhastwofree
bonds and is said to be unsaturated and bifunctional;
these mers can link up endwise to form a long-chainmolecule ⊿C
2H4/triangleleftn,w h e r e nis the degree of polymer-
ization or number of repeat units per chain. Thus the
relative mass3of a chain molecule is MDnMmon.
The resultant chain has a strong spine of covalently-bonded carbon atoms that are arranged in a three-
dimensional zigzag form because of their tetrahedral
bonding. Polyethylene in bulk can be visualized as atangledmass of very large numbersof individualchainmolecules. Each molecule may contain thousands of
mers, typically 10
3to 105. The carbon atoms act rather
like ‘universal joints’ and allow it to ﬂex and twist.
The mass and shape of these linear molecules
have a profound effect upon the physical, mechani-
cal and chemical properties of the bulk polymer. Asthe length of molecules increases, the melting points,strength, viscosity and chemical insolubility also tend
to increase. For the idealized and rare case of a

3It is common practice to use relative molecular masses or
‘molecular weights’. Strictly speaking, one should use
molar masses; that is, amounts of substance containing asmany elementary entities (molecules, mers), as there are
atoms in 0.012 kg of the carbon isotope
6C12.

monodisperse polymer, all the chain molecules are of
equal length and Mis constant. However, in practice,
polymersareusuallypolydispersewithastatisticaldis-
tribution of chain lengths (Figure 2.23). The average
molecular mass Mand the ‘spread’ in values between
short and long chains are important quantitative indi-
cators of behaviour during processing.
A polymer sample may be regarded as a collection
of fractions, or sub-ranges, of molecular size, with
each fraction having a certain mid-value of molecularmass. Let us suppose that the ith fraction contains
N
imolecules and that the mid-value of the fraction
isMi. Hence the total number of molecules for all
fractions of the sample is/summationtextNi. In calculating a single
numericalvalue,theaveragemolecularmass M,which
will characterize the distribution of chain sizes, it
is necessary to distinguish between number-averagefractions and mass-average fractions of molecules in
the sample. Thus, in calculating the number-average
molecular mass
MNof the sample, let the number
fraction be ˛i.T h e n ˛iDNi//summationtextNiand:

MNis very sensitive to the presence of low-mass
molecules; accordingly, it is likely to correlate with
any property that is sensitive to the presence of short-length molecules (e.g. tensile strength).
In similar fashion, the mass-average molecular mass
Mwcan be calculated from mass fractions /RSi.S i n c e

Using the Avogadro constant NA, we can relate mass

average molecular mass becomes:

The full molecular mass distribution, showing its
‘spread’, any skewness, as well as the two average
values MWandMN, can be determined by gel per-
meation chromatography (GPC). This indirect methodis calibrated with data obtained from direct physicalmeasurements on solutions of polymers (e.g. osmom-etry, light scattering, etc.). For the routine control ofproduction processes, faster and less precise methods,
such as melt ﬂow index (MFI) measurement, are used
to gauge the average molecular mass.
MWis particularly sensitive to the long-chain
molecules and therefore likely to relate to propertieswhich are strongly inﬂuenced by their presence (e.g.
viscosity).
MWalways exceeds MN. (In a hypothetical
monodisperse system, MWDMN.) This inequality
occurs because a given mass of polymer at one endof the distribution contains many short moleculeswhereas, at the other end, the same mass need
only contain a few molecules.
MWis generally
more informative than MNso far as bulk properties
are concerned. The ratio MW/MNis known as
the polydispersivity index; an increase in its valueindicates an increase in the ‘spread’, or dispersion,of the molecular mass distribution (MMD) in apolydisperse. In a relatively simple polymer, this ratiocan be as low as 1.5 or 2 but, as a result of complexpolymerization processes, it can rise to 50, indicatinga very broad distribution of molecular size.
The development of engineering polymers usually
aims at maximizing molecular mass. For a particularpolymer, there is a threshold value for the averagedegree of polymerization ⊿
n/triangleleftbeyond which properties
such as strengthand toughnessdevelop in a potentially
useful manner. (Either MWorMNcan be used to cal-
culate n.) It is apparent that very short molecules of
low mass can slip past each other fairly easily, to thedetriment of mechanical strength and thermal stability.On the other hand, entanglement of chains becomes
more prevalent as chains lengthen. However, improve-
ment in properties eventually becomes marginal andthe inevitable increase in viscosity can make process-ingverydifﬁcult.Thus,formanypracticalpolymers,
n
values lie in the range 200–2000, roughly correspond-ing to molecular masses of 20000 to 200000.

conditions of polymerization (e.g. pressure, tempera-ture,catalysttype)andencouragesidereactionsatsitesalong the spine of each discrete chain molecule. Theresultant branches can be short and/or long, even mul-tiple. Polyethylene provides an important commercial
example of this versatility. The original low-density
form (LDPE) has a high degree of branching, withabout 15–30 short and long branches per thousand
carbon atoms, and a density less then 940 kg m
/NUL3.
34Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
The use of different catalysts permitted lower poly-
merization pressures and led to the development ofa high-density form (HDPE) with just a few short
branchesandadensitygreaterthan940 kg m
/NUL3.Being
more linear and closely-packed than LDPE, HDPE isstronger, more rigid and has a melting point ⊿135
°C/triangleleft
which is 25 °C higher.
Weak forces exist between adjacent chain molecules
in polyethylene. Heating, followed by the applicationof pressure, causes the molecules to straighten and
slide past each other easily in a viscous manner.
Molecular mobility is the outstanding feature ofthermoplastics and they are well suited to melt-
extrusion and injection-moulding. These processes
tend to align the chain molecules parallel to the
direction of shear, producing a pronounced preferred
orientation (anisotropy) in the ﬁnal product. If thepolymer is branched, rather than simply linear,
Table 2.6 Repeat units of typical thermoplastics

Atomic arrangements in materials 35
branches on adjacent chains will hook on to each
other and reduce their relative mobility. This effect
underlines the fundamental importance of molecularshape.
In the important vinyl family of thermoplastics, one
of the four hydrogen atoms in the C
2H4monomer of
polyethylene is replaced by either a single atom (chlo-
rine) or a group of atoms, such as the methyl radical
CH3, the aromatic benzene ring C 6H6and the acetate
radical C 2H3O2. These four polymers, polyvinyl chlo-
ride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) andpolyvinyl acetate (PVAc), are illustrated in Table 2.6.
Introduction of a different atom or group alongside
the spine of the molecule makes certain alternative
symmetries possible. For instance, when all the chlo-
rideatomsofthePVCmoleculeliealongthesamesideof each chain, thepolymer issaid tobe isotactic.In thesyndiotactic form, chlorine atoms are disposed sym-metrically around and along the spine of the molecule.A fully-randomized arrangement of chlorine atoms isknown as the atactic form. Like side-branching, tac-
ticity can greatly inﬂuence molecular mobility. During
addition polymerization, it is possible for two or morepolymers to compete simultaneously during the join-ing of mers and thereby form a copolymer with itsownuniqueproperties.Thus,a vinylcopolymer ispro-duced by combining mers of vinyl chloride and vinyl
acetate in a random sequence.
1In some copolymers,
each typeofconstituentmer may form alternateblocksof considerable length within the copolymeric chains.
Branching can, of course, occur in copolymers as well
in ‘straight’ polymers.
2.7.2 Elastomers
The development of a relatively small number ofcrosslinking chains between linear molecules can pro-duce an elastomeric material which, according to an
ASTM deﬁnition, can be stretched repeatedly at room
temperature to at least twice its original length andwhich will, upon sudden release of the stress, returnforciblytoitsapproximateoriginallength.AsshowninFigure 2.24, the constituent molecules are in a coiledand kinked condition when unstressed; during elastic
strain, they rapidly uncoil. Segments of the structure
are locally mobile but the crosslinks tend to preventany gross relative movement of adjoining molecules,i.e. viscous deformation. However, under certain con-ditions it is possible for elastomers, like most poly-mers, tobehave in a viscoelasticmanner when stressedand to exhibit both viscous (time-dependent) and elas-
tic (instantaneous) strain characteristics. These two
effects can be broadly attributed, respectively, to the

from polycarbonate thermoplastics of very high purity.

relative movement and the uncoiling and/or unravel-
ling of molecular segments.
Elastomers include natural polymers, such as poly-
isoprene and polybutadiene in natural rubbers, and
synthetic polymers, such as polychloroprene ( Neo-
prene), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and silicone
rubbers. The structural repeat units of some impor-
tant elastomers are shown in Table 2.7. In the orig-
inal vulcanization process, which was discovered by
C. Goodyear in 1839 after much experimentation, iso-
prene was heated with a small amount of sulphur toa temperature of 140
°C, causing primary bonds or
crosslinks to form between adjacent chain molecules.
Individual crosslinks take the form C–(S) n–C, where
nis equal to or greater than unity. Monosulphide links
⊿nD1/triangleleftare preferred because they are less likely to
break than longer links. They are also less likely to
allow slowdeformation under stress(creep). Examples
of the potentially-reactive double bonds that open up
and act as a branching points for crosslinking are
shown in Table 2.7. Nowadays, the term vulcaniza-tion is applied to any crosslinking or curing process
which improves elasticity and strength; it does not
necessarily involve the use of sulphur. Hard rubber(Ebonite)contains 30–50%sulphurand is accordingly
heavilycrosslinkedandnolongerelastomeric.Itslong-
established use for electrical storage battery cases is
now being challenged by polypropylene (PP).
Themajorityofpolymersexhibitastructuralchange
known as the glass transition point, T

perature value is speciﬁc to each polymer and is of
great practical and scientiﬁc signiﬁcance. (Its impli-cations will be discussed more fully in Chapter 11.)
In general terms, it marks a transition from hard, stiff
and brittle behaviour (comparable to that of an inor-ganic glass) to soft, rubbery behaviour as the tempera-
ture increases. The previously-given ASTM deﬁnition
described mechanical behaviour at room temperature;
it follows that the elastomeric condition refers to tem-
peratures well above T
g. Table 2.7 shows that typi-
cal values for most elastomers lie in the range /NUL50°
to/NUL80°C. When an elastomeric structure is heated
through Tg, the segments between the linkage or
branching points are able to vibrate more vigorously.
36Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Table 2.7 Repeat units of typical elastomers
A simple linear equation expresses the temperature-
dependence of an elastomer’s response to shear stress:
/SYNDNkT
where /SYNis the shear modulus, Nis the number
of segments per unit volume of structure (betweensuccessive points of crosslinking), kis the Boltzmann
constant and Tis absolute temperature. Segments are
typically about 100 repeat units long. Clearly, for a
given polymer, the stiffness under shear conditions isdirectly proportional to the absolute temperature. Astemperature increases, deﬂection under load becomes
less. This rather unusual feature has raised engineering
problems in suspension systems.
At higher temperatures, well above T
g, the poly-
meric structure is likely to deform slowly under
applied stress (creep) and ultimately to break downintosmaller chemical entities,or degrade. Asindicated
in Figure 2.24, unstressed elastomers are disordered
and non-crystalline. Interestingly, stressing to producea high elastic strain, say 200% or more, will inducea signiﬁcant amount of crystallinity. Stress aligns thechains and produces regions in which repeat units
form ordered patterns. (This effect is readily demon-
strated by projecting a monochromatic beam of X-raysthrough relaxed and stretched membranes of an elas-tomer and comparing the diffraction patterns formed
upon photographic ﬁlm.)2.7.3 Thermosets
In the third and remaining category of polymers,
known generally as thermosets or network polyme ˇrs,
the degree of crosslinking is highly developed. As aresult, these structures contain many branching points.They are rigid and strong, being inﬁnitely bracedin three dimensions by numerous chain segments ofrelatively short length. Unlike thermoplastics, molec-ular mobility is virtually absent and T
gis accord-
ingly high, usually being above 50 °C. Thermosets are
therefore regarded generally as being hard and brittle(‘glassy’) materials. Examples of thermoset resins incommon use include phenol-formaldehyde (P-F resin;Bakelite),epoxyresins(structuraladhesives; Araldite),
urea formaldehyde (U-F resin; Beetle) and polyester
resins. A resin is a partially-polymerized substancewhich requires further treatment.
The utilization of thermosets typically involves two
stages of chemical reaction. In the ﬁrst stage, a liq-uid or solid prepolymer form or precursor is producedwhich is physically suitable for casting or moulding.Resins are well-known examples of this intermedi-ate state. Their structures consist mostly of linearmolecules and they are potentially reactive, having aspeciﬁable shelf-life. In the second stage, extensivecrosslinking is promoted by heating, pressure applica-tion or addition of a hardening agent, depending upon
Atomic arrangements in materials 37
the type of polymer. This stage is commonly referred
to as curing. The resultant random network possessesthe desired stiffness and strength. When heated, thisstructure does not exhibit viscoelastic ﬂow and, being
both chemically and physically stable, remains unal-
tered and hard until the decomposition temperatureis reached. The formation of a thermoset may thusbe regarded as an irreversible process. With pheno-
lic resins, ﬁnal crosslinking is induced by heating, as
implied by the term thermoset. The latter term is alsoapplied, in a looser sense, to polymers in which ﬁnalcrosslinking occurs as the result of adding a hard-
ener; for example, in epoxy resin adhesives and in
the polyester resin-based matrix of glass-reinforcedpolymer (GRP; Fibreglass ). In these substances, an
increase in the ratio of hardener to resin tends to
increase the T
gvalue and the modulus.
Many thermoset structures develop by condensa-
tion polymerization. This process is quite different inchemical character to the process of addition polymer-
ization by which linear molecules grow in an endwise
manner in thermoplastics. Although it is one of the
oldest synthetic polymers, having appeared as Bake-
litein the early 1900s, phenolformaldehyde retains its
industrial importance. It is widely used for injection-
mouldings in the automotive and electrical industries,
for surface coatings and as a binder for moulding
sands in metal foundries. It is therefore appropriate to
use phenolformaldehyde as an illustrative example of
the condensation reaction, focusing upon the novolac
resin route. In the ﬁrst stage (Figure 2.25a), phenol
and formaldehyde groups react to form an addition
compound (methylol derivative). Figure 2.25b shows
these derivatives joining with phenol groups in a con-
densation reaction. Methylene bridges ⊿CH2/triangleleftbegin to
form between adjacent phenol groups and molecules
of water are released. The two reactions shown dia-
grammatically in Figures 2.25a and 2.25b produce a

relatively unreactive novolac resin. (Control of the ini-
tialphenol/formaldehyderatioaboveunityensuresthata deﬁciency of formaldehyde will inhibit crosslinking
during this ﬁrst stage.) After drying, grinding and the
addition of ﬁllers and colourants, the partly-condensed
resin is treated with a catalysed curing agent which
acts as a source of formaldehyde. Network formationthen proceeds during hot-moulding at a temperature
of 200–300
°C. Each phenol group is said to be tri-
functional because it can contribute three links to thethree-dimensional random network (Figure 2.25c).
Another type of phenolic resin, the resole, is pro-
duced by using an initial phenol/formaldehyde ratio
of less than unity and a different catalyst. Because of
the excess of formaldehyde groups, it is then possibleto form the network structure by heating without the
addition of a curing agent.
2.7.4 Crystallinity in polymers
So far, we have regarded thermoplastic polymers as
essentially disordered (non-crystalline) structures in
which chain molecules of various lengths form a tan-
gled mass. This image is quite appropriate for somepolymers e.g. polystyrene and polymethyl methacry-
late (Perspex). However, as indicated in the case of
stressed elastomers (Section 2.7.2), it is possible forchain molecules to form regions in which repeat units
are alignedinclose-packed,ordered arrays. Crystalline
regions in polymers are generally lamellar in form and
often small, with their smallest dimension in the order
of 10–20 nm. Inevitably, because of the complexity ofthe molecules, crystallized regions are associated with
amorphous regions and defects. However, the degree
of crystallinity attainable can approach 80–85% by
volume of the structure. Thus, in polyethylene (PE),
a simple ‘linear’ thermoplastic that has been the sub-ject of much investigation, crystalline regions nucleate
and grow extremely rapidly during polymerization,
their formation being virtually unpreventable. Values
of 50% and 80%, respectively, are quoted for the crys-
tallinity of its low- and high-density forms, LDPE andHDPE. A medium-density form provides an appropri-
ate balance of strength and ﬂexibility and has beenused for the yellow distribution pipes which conveynatural gas in the UK. Crystalline regions are close-
packed and act as barriers to the diffusion of gases
and small molecules. This impermeability favours theuse of LDPE for food wrappings. HDPE, being evenmore crystalline, has a lower permeability to gases andvapours than LDPE.
A typical chain molecule contains hundreds, often
thousands, of single primary bonds along its zigzag-shaped backbone. Rotation about these bonds enablesthe molecule to bend, fold, coil and kink. Under cer-
tain circumstances, it is possible for it to adopt an
overall shape, or conformation, and then interlockin a close-packed manner alongside other molecules(or even itself) to form a three-dimensional crys-
talline region. Figure 2.26 shows a small portion of
a crystalline region in polyethylene. Segments of ﬁvechain molecules, composed of CH
2groups, are packed
together and said to be in extended conformation. (For
convenience, the carbon and hydrogen atoms have
been ‘shrunk’.) The orthorhombic unit cell,1with its
unequal axes, has been superimposed.
The criteria which determine the extent to which a
polymer can crystallize are (1) the conditions under
which the polymer forms or is processed, and (2) thestructuralcharacter of itsmolecules. Withregard totheconditions, crystallization is favoured by slow coolingrates. Industrially, rapid cooling usually prevails and
there is relatively little time available for molecular
packingandordering.Applicationofstresscanbeusedto induce crystallization either during or after poly-merization. As the degree of crystallization increases,
the polymer becomes denser; it also becomes more
resistant to thermal degradation. This important fea-ture is reﬂected in the crystalline melting point T
m.
1PE can also exist in a less stable monoclinic form. Cubic
forms, with their high symmetry, do not appear inpolymeric systems; consequently, crystalline polymersfrequently exhibit pronounced anisotropy.

At this temperature, which is higher in value than Tg,
the crystalline components of the structure break down
completely on heating (Figure 2.27). For a given poly-mer, T
mincreases with the degree of crystallinity; for
example, its values for LDPE and HDPE are 110 °C
and 135 °C, respectively. Holding a polymer at a tem-
perature between TgandTm(annealing) is sometimes
used as a method for increasing existing crystallinity.
Turning now to the matter of structural complex-
ity, crystallization is less likely as molecules becomelonger and more complex. Thus the presence ofside-branching is a steric hindrance to crystallization,particularly if the molecules are atactic in character.Iso- and syndio-tacticity are more readily accommo-
dated; for example, isotactic polypropylene (iPP) is
a material with useful engineering strength whereasatactic PP is a sticky gum. Scrutiny of the variousrepeat units shown earlier in Table 2.6 shows that theyare usually asymmetrical and may be said to possessa ‘head’ and a ‘tail’. Various combinations, or con-ﬁgurations, can result from addition polymerization,such as ‘head to tail’ ( XYXYXYXY ...) or ‘head to
head’ (XYYXXYYXX ...), etc. If the molecules have
asimilarandconsistentconﬁguration,crystallizationisfavoured.Forinstance,thepreviously-mentionedpoly-
mer, isotactic PP, has a ‘head to tail’ conﬁguration
throughout and can develop a high degree of crys-tallinity. Matching conﬁgurations favour crystallinity.Crystallinity is therefore more likely in copolymerswith regular block patterns of constituents than in ran-dom copolymers.
Summarizing, regular conformations and/or regular
conﬁgurationsfavourcrystallization.Eachofthesetwocharacteristics is manipulated in a different way. Con-formations are changed by physical means (annealing,application of stress): changes in conﬁguration require
the breaking of bonds and are achieved by chemical
means.The ﬁne structure of crystalline regions in commer-
cial polymers and their relation to associated amor-
phous regions have been the subject of much research.
An important advance was made in the 1950s whensingle crystals of polyethylene were produced for
the ﬁrst time. A typical method of preparation is
to dissolve <0.01% PE in xylene at a temperature
of 135–138
°C and then cool slowly to 70–80 °C.
The small PE crystals that precipitate are several
microns across and only 10–20 nm thick. The thick-
ness of these platey crystals (lamellae) is temperature-
dependent.Diffractionstudiesbytransmissionelectron
microscope showed that, surprisingly, the axes of thechain molecules were approximately perpendicular to
the two large faces of each lamella. In view of the
smallness of the crystal thickness relative to the aver-
age length of molecules, it was deduced that multiple
chain-folding had occurred during crystallization from
the mother liquor. In other words, a molecule could
exhibit an extended and/or folded conformation. The
chain-folding model has been disputed but is now
generally accepted. The exact nature of the fold sur-face has also been the subject of much debate; typical
modelsfor foldingare showninFigure 2.28.Themea-
sured density of these single crystals is less than the
theoretical value; this feature indicates that irregular
arrangements exist at fold surfaces and that the crystal
itself contains defects. Most of the folds or loops are

molecular structure. ‘Loose’ loops of larger radius and
chain ends (cilia) project from the surfaces of lamel-lae. These fundamental studies on single crystals had
a far-reaching effect upon polymer physics, compara-
ble in importance to that of single metal crystals upon
metallurgical science.
In contrast to the relatively uncongested conditions
that exist at the surface of an isolated crystal
growing from a dilute solution, entanglement of
chain molecules is more likely when a polymer

crystallizes from the molten state. Consequently, melt-
grown crystallites are more complex in physical
character. Microscopical examination of thin sections
of certain crystallizable polymers (PE, PS ornylon) can reveal a visually-striking spherulitic state
of crystalline aggregation. In Figure 2.29, three-
dimensional spherulites have grown in a radial
manner from a number of nucleating points scattered
throughout the melt. Nucleation can occur if a fewmolecular segments chance to order locally at a point
(homogeneous nucleation). However, it is more likely
that nucleation is heterogeneous, being initiated by thepresence of particles of foreign matter or deliberately-
added nucleating agents. Radial growth continues until
spherulites impinge upon each other. Spherulites are
much larger thanthe isolatedsinglecrystals previouslydescribed and range in diameter from microns to
millimetres, depending upon conditions of growth.Thus crystallization at a temperature just below T
m
will proceed from relatively few nucleating points and
will ultimately produce a coarse spherulitic structure.However, this prolonged ‘annealing’, or very slow
cooling from the molten state, can produce cracks
between the spherulites (over-crystallization).
Internally, spherulites consist of lamellae. During
crystallization, the lamellae grow radially from thenucleus. As with solution-grown single crystals, theselamellaedevelopbychain-foldingandareabout10nm
thick. Space-ﬁlling lamellar branches also form. Fre-
quently, a chain molecule extends within one lamellaand then leaves to enter another. The resultant inter-lamellar ties or links have an important role duringdeformation, as will be discussed later. Inevitably, theoutward growth of lamellae traps amorphous material.
Spherulites are about 70–80% crystalline if the con-
stituent molecules are simple. The layered mixture ofstronglamellaeandweakeramorphousmaterialisrem-iniscent of pearlite in steel and, as such, is sometimesregarded as a self-assembled ( in situ) composite.
Thedistinctivepatternsseenwhenspheruliticaggre-
gates are examined between crossed polars in a light
microscope (Figure 2.29) provide evidence that the
lamellae radiating from the nucleus twist in synchro-nism. For orthorhombic PE, the c-axes of lamellae lie
parallel to the length of the extended chain moleculesand are tangential to the spherulite (Figure 2.30). Thea-o rb-axes are radial in direction. Lamellae twist as
they grow and the c-axes remain normal to the growth
direction. The refractive index gradually changes foreach lamella, causing incident plane-polarized lightto become elliptically polarized in four quadrants ofeach spherulite and to form the characteristic ‘Mal-tese cross’ ﬁgure. The grain boundary structures of

polycrystalline metals and alloys are reminiscent of
spherulitic structures in polymers. Indeed, control ofspherulite size in partially-crystallized polymers and
of grain (crystal) size in fully-crystallized metals and
alloys are well-known means of manipulating strength
and deformability.
The mechanism of molecular movement in a poly-
meric melt haspresenteda puzzlingscientiﬁcproblem.
In particular, itwas notknown exactly how a molecule
isabletomoveamongentangledmoleculesandtopar-ticipate in the progressive chain-folding action that is
the outstanding feature of crystallization. Clearly, it is
completely different from atomic and ionic diffusionin metals and ceramics. This long-standing problem
Figure 2.31 Movement of a polymer molecule by reptation .was convincingly resolved by de Gennes,1who pio-
neered the idea of reptation, a powerful concept that
serves to explain various viscous and elastic effects
in polymers. He proposed that a long-chain molecule,acting as an individual, is able to creep lengthwise
in snake-like movements through the entangled mass
of molecules. It moves within a constraining ‘reptation
tube’ (Figure 2.31) which occupies free space between
molecules;thediameter ofthisconvoluted‘tube’istheminimum distance between two entangling molecules.
The reptant motion enables a molecule to shift its cen-
tre of mass along a ‘tube’ and to progress through a
tangled polymeric structure. Reptation is more difﬁcult
for the longer molecules. At the surface of a growing
crystalline lamella, a molecule can be ‘reeled in from
its tube’ and become part of the chain-folding process.

Structural phases: their formation and
transitions
3.1 Crystallization from the melt
3.1.1 Freezing of a pure metal
At some stage of production the majority of metals
and alloys are melted and then allowed to solidify asa casting. The latter may be an intermediate product,such as a large steel ingot suitable for hotworking,
or a complex ﬁnal shape, such as an engine cylinder
block of cast iron or a single-crystal gas-turbine bladeof superalloy. Solidiﬁcation conditions determine thestructure, homogeneity and soundness of cast productsand the governing scientiﬁc principles ﬁnd applicationover a wide range of ﬁelds. For instance, knowledge
of the solidiﬁcation process derived from the study
of conventional metal casting is directly relevantto many fusionwelding processes, which may beregarded as ‘casting in miniature’, and to the fusion-castingofoxiderefractories. Theliquid/solidtransitionis obviously of great scientiﬁc and technologicalimportance.
First, in order to illustrate some basic principles,
we will consider the freezing behaviour of a melt oflike metal atoms. The thermal history of a slowlycooling metal is depicted in Figure 3.1; the plateauon the curve indicates the melting point (m.p.), whichis pressure-dependent and speciﬁc to the metal. Its
value relates to the bond strength of the metal. Thus,
the drive to develop strong alloys for service at hightemperatures has stimulated research into new andimproved ways of casting high-m.p. alloys based uponiron, nickel or cobalt.
The transition from a highly-disordered liquid to an
ordered solid is accompanied by a lowering in the
energy state of the metal and the release of thermalenergy (latent heat of solidiﬁcation),forming the arreston the cooling curve shown in Figure 3.1. This order-ing has a marked and immediate effect upon otherstructure-sensitivepropertiesofthemetal;forinstance,
the volume typically decreases by 1–6%, the electrical

conductivity rises and the diffusivity, or ability of the
atoms to migrate, falls.
Solidiﬁcation is a classic example of a nucleation
and growth process. In the general case of freezing
within the bulk of pure molten metal, minute crys-
talline nuclei form independently at random points.
After this homogeneous form of nucleation, contin-ued removal of thermal energy from the system causes
these small crystalline regions to grow independently
at the expense of the surrounding melt. Throughout
the freezing process, there is a tendency for bombard-
ment by melt atoms to destroy embryonic crystals;
only nuclei which exceed a critical size are able to
survive. Rapid cooling of a pure molten metal reduces
the time available for nuclei formation and delays the

onset of freezing by a temperature interval of T.
This thermal undercooling (or supercooling), whichis depicted in Figure 3.1, varies in extent, dependingupon the metal and conditions, but can be as much as0.1–0.3 T
m,w h e r e Tmis the absolute melting point.
However, commercial melts usuallycontainsuspended
insoluble particles of foreign matter (e.g. from therefractory crucible or hearth) which act as seedingnuclei for so-called heterogeneous nucleation. Under-cooling is much less likely under these conditions; in
fact, very pronounced undercooling is only obtainable
when the melt is very pure and extremely small involume. Homogeneous nucleation is not encounteredin normal foundry practice.
The growing crystals steadily consume the melt and
eventually impinge upon each other to form a struc-
ture of equiaxed (equal-sized) grains (Figures 3.2 and3.3). Heterogeneous nucleation, by providing a largerpopulation of nuclei, produces a smaller ﬁnal grainsize than homogeneous nucleation. The resultant grain
(crystal)boundariesare severalatomicdiameterswide.
The angle of misorientation between adjacent grainsis usually greater than 10–15
°. Because of this mis-
ﬁt, such high-angle grain boundaries have a higherenergy content than the bulk grains, and, on reheating,
will tend to melt ﬁrst. (During a grain-contrast etch
of diamond-polished polycrystalline metal, the etchantattacks grain boundaries preferentially by an electro-chemical process, producing a broad ‘canyon’ whichscatters vertically incident light during normal micro-
scopical examination. The boundary then appears as a
black line.)
During the freezing of many metals (and alloys),
nucleated crystals grow preferentially in certain direc-tions,causingeachgrowingcrystaltoassumeadistinc-
tive, non-faceted
1tree-like form, known as a dendrite
(Figure 3.2). In cubic crystals, the preferred axes ofgrowth are h100 idirections. As each dendritic spike
grows, latent heat is transferred into the surroundingliquid, preventing the formation of other spikes in its
immediate vicinity. The spacing of primary dendrites
and of dendritic arms therefore tends to be regular.Ultimately, as the various crystals impinge upon eachother, it is necessary for the interstices of the dendritesto be well-fed with melt if interdendritic shrinkage
cavities are to be prevented from forming. Convection
currentswithinthecoolingmeltareliabletodisturbthedelicate dendritic branches and produce slight angu-lar misalignments in the ﬁnal solidiﬁed structure (e.g.5–10

surface of misﬁt being equivalent to an array of edgedislocations (Chapter 4). Convection currents can also

non-faceted dendritic morphology, e.g. transparentsuccinonitrile-6% camphor has proved a valuable means of
simulating dendrite growth on a hot-stage optical
microscope. Most non-metals grow with a facetedmorphology.

provide thermal pulses which cause dendritic branch
tips to melt off and enter the main body of the melt
where they act as ‘kindred nuclei’. Gentle stirring of
the melt encourages this process, which is known asdendrite multiplication, and can be used to produce a
ﬁne-grained and equiaxed structure (e.g. electromag-
netic stirring of molten steel). Dendrite multiplicationis now recognised as an important source of crystalsin castings and ingots.
3.1.2 Plane-front and dendritic solidiﬁcation
at a cooled surface
The previous section describes random, multidirec-
tional crystallization within a cooling volume of puremolten metal. In practice, freezing oftencommences at
the plane surface of a mould under more complex and
constrained conditions, with crystals growing counterto the general direction of heat ﬂow. The morphologyof the interface, as well as the ﬁnal grain structure of
the casting, are then decided by thermal conditions at
the solid/liquid interface.
44Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Figure 3.4 Plane-front solidiﬁcation (a) and dendritic solidiﬁcation (b) of a pure metal, as determined by thermal conditions .
Figure 3.4a illustrates the case where all the latent
heat evolved at the interface ﬂows into the solid andthe temperature gradients in solid and liquid, G
Sand
GL, are positive. The solidiﬁcation front, which moves
at a velocity R, is stable, isothermal and planar. Any
solid protuberance which chances to form on this frontwill project into increasingly hotter, superheated liquidand will therefore quickly dissolve and be absorbed by
the advancing front. Planar-front solidiﬁcation is char-
acterized by a high G
L/Rratio (e.g. slow cooling). If
the solid is polycrystalline, emerging grain boundarieswill form grooves in the stable planar front.
In the alternative scenario (Figure 3.4b), for which
G
L/Rhas relatively low values, latent heat ﬂows into
both solid and liquid and GLbecomes negative. A
planar interface becomes unstable. Dendritic protu-
berances (spikes) grow rapidly into the undercooled
liquid, which quickly absorbs their evolved latent heat.Thermal undercooling is thus an essential prerequi-site for dendritic growth; this form of growth becomesmore and more likely as the degree of thermal under-cooling increases. Melts almost invariably undercoolslightly before solidiﬁcation so that dendritic mor-phologies are very common. (The ability of dilute
alloy melts to produce a cellular morphology as a
result of constitutional undercooling will be describedin Section 3.2.4.3.)
3.1.3 Forms of cast structure
Because of the interplay of a variety of physical andchemical factors during freezing, the as-cast grain
structure is usually not as uniform and straightforwardas those discussed in the previous two sections.
When solidiﬁcation commences at the ﬂat surface of
a metallic ingot mould there is usually an extreme
undercooling or chilling action which leads to theheterogeneous nucleation of a thin layer of small,randomly-oriented chill crystals (Figure 3.5). The sizeof these equiaxed crystals is strongly inﬂuenced bythe texture of the mould surface. As the thickness ofthe zone of chill crystals increases, the temperaturegradient G
Lbecomes less steep and the rate of cooling
decreases. Crystal growth rather than the nucleationof new crystals now predominates and, in manymetals and alloys, certain favourably-oriented crystalsat the solid/liquid interface begin to grow into themelt. As in the case of the previously-described
Figure 3.5 Chill-cast ingot structure .
Structural phases: their formation and transitions 45
dendrites, the rapid growth directions are h100 ifor
fcc and bcc crystals and lie along the direction of
heat ﬂow. Sideways growth is progressively hinderedso that the crystals develop a preferred orientationand a characteristic columnar form. They thereforeintroduce directionality into the bulk structure; thiseffect will be most pronounced if the metal itselfis strongly anisotropic (e.g. cph zinc). The preferred
growth directions for cph crystals are h10
10i.T h e
growth form of the interface between the columnarcrystals and the liquid varies from planar to dendritic,depending upon the particular metal (or alloy) andthermal conditions.
As the columnar zone thickens, the temperatures
within the liquid become more shallow, undercoolingmore prominent and the presence of kindred nucleifrom dendritic multiplication more likely. Under theseconditions, independent nucleation (Section 3.1.1) isfavoured and a central zone of equiaxed, randomly-oriented crystals can develop (Figure 3.5). Other fac-torssuchasalowpouringtemperature(lowsuperheat),moulds of low thermal conductivity and the presence
of alloying elements also favour the development of
this equiaxed zone. There is a related size effect, withthe tendency for columnar crystals to form decreasingas the cross-section of the mould cavity decreases.However, in the absence of these inﬂuences, growthpredominates over nucleation, and columnar zone mayextend to the centre of the ingot (e.g. pure metals).The balance between the relative proportions of outercolumnarcrystalsandinnerequiaxedcrystalsisimpor-tant and demands careful control. For some purposes,a completely ﬁne-grained stucture is preferred, beingstronger and more ductile. Furthermore, it will notcontain the planes of weakness, shown in Figure 3.5,whichformwhencolumnarcrystalsimpingeuponeachother obliquely. (In certain specialized alloys, how-
ever, such as those for high-power magnets and creep-
resistant alloys, a coarse grain size is prescribed.)
The addition of various ‘foreign’ nucleating agents,
known as inoculants, is a common and effectivemethod for providing centres for heterogeneous nucle-ation within the melt, inhibiting undercooling andproducing a uniform ﬁne-grained structure. Reﬁningthe grain structure disperses impurity elements over agreater area of grain boundary surface and generallybeneﬁts mechanical and founding properties (e.g. duc-tility, resistance to hot-tearing). However, the need forgrain reﬁnement during casting operations is often lesscrucialifthecaststructurecanbesubsequentlyworkedand/or heat-treated. Nucleating agents must remainﬁnely dispersed, must survive and must be wetted by
thesuperheatedliquid.Examples ofinoculantsare tita-
nium and/or boron (for aluminium alloys), zirconiumor rare earth metals (for magnesium alloys) and alu-minium(forsteel).Zirconiumisanextremelyeffectivegrain-reﬁner for magnesium and its alloys. The closesimilarity in lattice parameters between zirconium andmagnesium suggeststhat the oriented overgrowth (epi-taxy) of magnesium upon zirconium is an importantfactor; however, inoculants have largely been devel-
oped empirically.
3.1.4 Gas porosity and segregation
So far we have tended to concentrate upon thebehaviour of pure metals. It is now appropriate to
consider the general behaviour of dissimilar types of
atoms which, broadly speaking, fall into two main
categories: those that have been deliberately added fora speciﬁc purpose (i.e. alloying) and those that are
accidentally present as undesirable impurities. Most
metallic melts, when exposed to a furnace atmosphere,
will readily absorb gases (e.g. oxygen, nitrogen,
hydrogen). The solubility of gas in liquid metal canbe expressed by Sievert’s relation, which states that
the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to
the square root of the partial pressure of the gas in the
contacting atmosphere. Thus, for hydrogen, which is
one of the most troublesome gases:

The constant Kis temperature-dependent. The solu-
bility of gases decreases during the course of freezing,usuallyquiteabruptly,andtheyarerejectedintheform
of gas bubbles which may become entrapped within
and between the crystals, forming weakening blow-
holes. It follows from Sievert’s relation that reducing
the pressure of the contacting atmosphere will reducethegascontentofthemelt;thisprincipleisthebasisof
vacuum melting and vacuum degassing. Similarly, the
passageofnumerousbubblesofaninert,low-solubility
gas through the melt will also favour gas removal (e.g.
scavenging treatment of molten aluminium with chlo-rine). Conversely, freezing under high applied pres-
sure, as in the die-casting process for light alloys,
suppresses the precipitation of dissolved gas and pro-
duces a cast shape of high density.
Dissolvedgas may precipitate as simple gas bubbles
but may, like oxygen, react with melt constituents to
form either bubbles of compound gas (e.g. CO
2,C O ,
SO2,H2Ovap) or insoluble non-metallic particles. The
latter are potential inoculants. Although their presence
may be accidental, as indicated previously, their delib-
erate formation is sometimes sought. Thus, a speciﬁcaddition of aluminium, an element with a high chem-
ical afﬁnity for oxygen, is used to deoxidize molten
steel in the ladle prior to casting; the resultant par-
ticles of alumina subsequently act as heterogeneous
nucleants, reﬁning the grain size.
Segregation almost invariably occurs during solid-
iﬁcation; unfortunately, its complete elimination is
impossible. Segregation, in its various forms, can seri-
ously impair the physical, chemical and mechanical
properties of a cast material. In normal segregation,atoms different to those which are crystallizing can
be rejected into the melt as the solid/liquid interface
advances. These atoms may be impurities or, as in the
case of a solid solution alloy, solute atoms. Insolu-
ble particles can also be pushed ahead of the interface.
46Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Eventually, pronounced macro-segregation can be pro-
duced in the ﬁnal regions to solidify, particularly if
the volume of the cast mass is large. On a ﬁner scale,micro-segregation can occur interdendritically withinboth equiaxed and columnar grains (coring) and at the
surfaces of low- and high-angle grain boundaries. The
modern analytical technique of Auger electron spec-troscopy (AES) is capable of detecting monolayersof impurity atoms at grain boundary surfaces and has
made it possible to study their very signiﬁcant effect
upon properties such as ductility and corrosion resis-tance (Chapter 5).
Intheothermainform ofseparationprocess,
1which
isknownasinversesegregation,thermalcontractionofthe solidiﬁed outer shell forces a residual melt of low
melting point outwards along intergranular channels
until it freezes on the outside of the casting (e.g. ‘tinsweat’ on bronzes, ‘phosphide sweat’ on grey castiron). The direction of this remarkable migration thus
coincides with that of heat ﬂow, in direct contrast
to normal macro-segregation. Inverse segregation canbe prevented by unidirectional solidiﬁcation. Later, inSection 3.2.4.4, it will be shown how the process of
zone-reﬁning, as used in the production of high-purity
materials for the electronics industry, takes positiveadvantage of segregation.
3.1.5 Directional solidiﬁcation
The exacting mechanical demands made upon gas tur-bine blades have led to the controlled exploitation ofcolumnar crystal growthand the developmentof direc-
tional solidiﬁcation (DS) techniques for superalloys.
2
As the turbine rotor rotates, the hot blades are subject
to extremely large centrifugal forces and to thermal
excursionsintemperature.Developmenthasproceeded
in two stages. First, a wholly columnar grain struc-ture, without grain boundaries transverse to the majoraxis of the blade, has been produced during preci-
sion investment casting by initiating solidiﬁcation at
a watercooled copper chill plate in the mould baseand then slowly withdrawing the vertically-positionedmouldfrom thehotzoneof anenclosingfurnace. Most
of the heat is removed by the chill plate. A restricted
number of crystals is able to grow parallel to the majoraxis of the blade. Transverse grain boundaries, whichhave been the initiation sites for intergranular creep
failuresinequiaxedbladestructures,arevirtuallyelim-
inated. Grain shape is mainly dependent upon (1) thethermal gradient G
Lextending into the melt from the
melt/solid interface and (2) the growth rate Rat which
this interface moves. Graphical plots of GLversus R

separations, it is essentially a physical process.
2Directional solidiﬁcation of high-temperature alloys was
pioneered by F. L. VerSnyder and R. W. Guard at theGeneral Electric Company, Schenectady, USA, in the late
1950s; by the late 1960s, DS blades were being used in gas
turbines of commercial aircraft.

have provided a useful means for predicting the grain
morphology of DS alloys.
Inthesecond,logicalstageofdevelopment,asingle-
crystal (SC) turbine blade is produced by placing a
geometrical restriction between a chilled starter block
and the mould proper (Figure 3.6). This spiral selector
causes several changes in direction and ensures that
only one of the upward-growing columnar crystals in
the starter block survives. A typical production unitis illustrated in Figure 3.7. The orientation of every
blade is checked by means of a computerized X-ray
diffraction procedure (e.g. the SCORPIO system at
Rolls-Royce). In the fcc nickel-based superalloys, the
favoured [100] growth direction coincides with themajor axis of the blade and fortunately offers the best
overall mechanical properties. For instance, the modu-
lus of elasticity is low in the h100idirections; conse-
quently,thermalstressesarereducedandtheresistance

is precisely located close to the chill plate and gives
the desired epitaxial, or oriented, overgrowth. The pro-
duction of single-crystal turbine blades by directional

It has also had a far-reaching effect upon the philoso-phy of alloy design. Previously, certain elements, suchas carbon, boron, hafnium and zirconium, were addedin order to strengthen grain boundary surfaces. Unfor-tunately, their presence lowers the incipient meltingpoint.

3.1.6 Production of metallic single crystals
for research
Development of highly-specialized industrial-scale
techniques, such as the directional solidiﬁcation(DS) of turbine blades and the production ofsilicon, germanium and various compounds forsemiconductors, owes much to expertise gained overmany years in producing small single crystals for
fundamental research. Several methods originally
developed for metals have been adapted for ceramics.Experiments with single crystals of metals (andceramics and polymers) have a special place in thehistory of materials science. The two basic methodsfor preparing single crystals involve (1) solidiﬁcationfrom the melt and (2) grain growth in the solid state.
In the simplest version of the solidiﬁcation method,
the polycrystalline metal to be converted to a single
crystal is supported in a horizontal, non-reactive boat
(e.g. graphite) and made to to freeze progressivelyfrom one end by passing an electric furnace, withits peak temperature set about 10
°C above the melt-
ing point, over the boat. Although several nuclei mayform during initial solidiﬁcation, the sensitivity of the
growth rate to orientation usually results in one of the
crystals swamping the others and eventually formingthe entire growthfront. Themethod is particularlyuse-ful for seeding crystals of a predetermined orientation.A seed crystal is placed adjacent to the polycrystalline
sample in the boat and the junction is melted before
commencing the melting/solidiﬁcation process. Wirespecimens may be grown in silica or heat-resistantglass tubes internally coated with graphite ( Aquadag).
In a modern development of these methods, the sam-
ple is enclosed in an evacuated silica tube and placed
in a water-cooled copper boat; passage through a high-frequency heating coil produces a melt zone.
Most solidiﬁcation techniques for single crystals are
derived from the Bridgman and Czochralski methods.
In the former, a pure metal sample is loaded in a
vertical mould of smooth graphite, tapered to a pointat the bottom end. The mould is lowered slowly downa tubular furnace which produces a narrow melt zone.
The crystal grows from the point of the mould. In
the Czochralski method, often referred to as ‘crystal-pulling’, a seed crystal is withdrawn slowly from thesurface of a molten metal, enabling the melt to solidifywith the same orientation as the seed. Rotation of the
crystalasitiswithdrawnproducesacylindricalcrystal.
This technique is used for the preparation, in vacuo,
of Si and Ge crystals.
Crystals may also be prepared by a ‘ﬂoating-zone’
technique(e.g.metalsofhighmeltingpointsuchasW,
Mo and Ta). A pure polycrystalline rod is gripped at
the top and bottom in water-cooled grips and rotatedin an inert gas or vacuum. A small melt zone, pro-duced by either a water-cooled radio-frequency coilor electron bombardment from a circular ﬁlament, is
passed up its length. High purity is possible because
the specimen has no contact with any source of con-tamination and also because there is a zone-reﬁningaction (Section 3.2.4.4).

depend upon the annealing of deformed samples. In
the strain-anneal technique, a ﬁne-grained polycrys-talline metal is critically strained approximately 1–2%elongation in tension and then annealed in a moving-gradient furnace with a peak temperature set below
the melting point or transformation temperature. Light
straining produces very few nuclei for crystallization;during annealing, one favoured nucleus grows morerapidly than the other potential nuclei, which it con-sumes. The method has been applied to metals and
alloys of high stacking-fault energy, e.g. Al, silicon-
iron, (see Chapter 4). Single crystals of metals withlow stacking-fault energy, such as Au and Ag, aredifﬁcult to grow because of the ease of formationof annealing twins which give multiple orientations.
Hexagonal metals are also difﬁcult to prepare because

3.2 Principles and applications of
phase diagrams
3.2.1 The concept of a phase
The term ‘phase’ refers to a separate and identiﬁ-
able state of matter in which a given substance mayexist. Being applicable to both crystalline and non-crystalline materials, its use provides a convenientway of expressing a material’s structure. Thus, inaddition to the three crystalline forms mentioned in
Section 2.5.1, the element iron may exist as a liquid
or vapour, giving ﬁve phases overall. Similarly, theimportant refractory oxide silica is able to exist asthree crystalline phases, quartz, tridymite and cristo-balite, as well as a non-crystalline phase, silica glass,andasmoltensilica.Undercertainconditions,itispos-sible for two or more different phases to co-exist. Theglass-reinforced polymer (GRP) known as Fibreglass
is an example of a two-phase structure.
When referring to a particular phase in the structure
of a material, we imply a region comprising a largenumber of atoms (or ions or molecules) and the exis-tence of a bounding surface which separates it fromcontiguous phases. Local structural disturbances andimperfections are disregarded. Thus, a pure metal oran oxide solid solution are each described, by conven-tion, as single-phase structures even though they maycontain grain boundaries, concentration gradients (cor-ing) and microdefects, such as vacancies, dislocationsand voids (Chapter 4). Industrial practice understand-ably favours relatively rapid cooling rates, frequently
causingphasestoexistinametastablecondition.Some
form of ‘triggering’ process, such as thermal activa-tion, is needed before a metastable phase can adoptthe stable, or equilibrium, state of lowest energy (e.g.annealing of metals and alloys). These two features,structural heterogeneity on a micro-scale and non-equilibrium, do not give rise to any untoward scientiﬁcdifﬁculty.
Theproductionofthethermal-shockresistantknown
asVycorprovides an interesting example of the
potential of phase control.
1Although glasses of very
high silica content are eminently suitable for high-temperature applications, their viscosity is very high,making fabrication by conventional methods difﬁcultand costly. This problem was overcome by takingadvantage of phase separation in a workable silicacontaining a high proportion of boric oxide. Aftershaping, this glass is heat-treated at a temperatureof 500–600
°C in order to induce separation of two
distinct and interpenetrating glassy phases. Electronmicroscopy reveals a wormlike boron-rich phase sur-rounded by a porous siliceous matrix. Leaching in hotacid dissolvesaway the former phase, leavinga porous

3.2.2 The Phase Rule
For a given metallic or ceramic material, there isa theoretical condition of equilibrium in which eachconstituent phase is in a reference state of lowestenergy. The independent variables determining this
energy state, which are manipulated by scientists and
technologists, are composition, temperature and pres-sure. The Phase Rule derived by Willard Gibbs fromcomplex thermodynamical theory provides a devicefor testing multi-phase (heterogeneous) equilibria anddeciding the number of variables (degrees of free-
dom) necessary to deﬁne the energy state of a sys-
tem. Its basic equation, PCFDCC2, relates the
number of phases present at equilibrium ⊿P/triangleleftand the
number of degrees of freedom ⊿F/triangleleftto the number of
components ⊿C/triangleleft, which is the smallest number of sub-
stances of independently-variable composition making
up the system. For metallic systems, the components
are metallic elements: for ceramics, the componentsare frequently oxides (e.g. MgO, SiO
2,e t c . ) .
Consider Figure 3.8, which is a single-component
(unary) diagram representing the phase relations for atypical pure metal. Transitions such as melting, subli-
mation and vaporization occur as boundaries between
the three single-phase ﬁelds are crossed. Supposethat conditions are such that three phases of a puremetal co-exist simultaneously, a unique condition rep-resented by the triple-point O. Applying the PhaseRule: PD3,CD1a n d FD0. This system is said
to be invariant with no degrees of freedom. Having
stated that ‘three phases co-exist’, the energy state isfully deﬁned and it is unnecessary to specify valuesfor variables. One or two phases could be caused todisappear, but this would require temperature and/orpressure to be changed. Similarly, at a melting point
on the line between single-phase ﬁelds, a solid and
a liquid phase may co-exist (i.e. PD2,CD1a n d
FD1). Speciﬁcation of one variable (either tempera-
ture or pressure) will sufﬁce to deﬁne the energy stateof a particular two-phase equilibrium. A point withinone of the single-phase ﬁelds represents a system that
is bivariant ⊿FD2/triangleleft. Both temperature and pressure
must be speciﬁed if its state is to be fully deﬁned.
Let us consider some practical implications of
Figure 3.8. The line for the solid/liquid transition isshown with a slight inclination to the right in thisschematic diagram because, theoretically, one may
reason from Le Chatelier’s principle that a pressure
increase on a typical melt, from P
1toP2, will favour
a constraint-removing contraction and therefore leadto freezing. (Bismuth and gallium are exceptions: like
Structural phases: their formation and transitions 49

water, they expand on freezing and the solid/liquid
line has an opposite slope.) The pressure at the critical
point C, beyond which liquid and vapour are indis-
tinguishable, is usually extremely high and consider-
ably greater than one atmosphere. The diagram refers
to an enclosed system. For instance, if molten metalis in a vacuum system, and the pressure is reduced
isothermally from P
1toP3, then vaporization will be
favoured.
For most metals, the pressure value at the
triple point is far below one atmosphere ⊿1a t m D
101.325 kN m/NUL2¾D1b a r/triangleleft. For copper and lead, it is
intheorderof10/NUL6atm. Thepressuresassociatedwith
the solid/vapour line are obviously even lower. Thus,
for most metals, vapour pressure is disregarded and itis customary to use isobaric (constant pressure) phase
diagrams in which the composition (concentration) of
component metals is plotted against temperature. As
a consequence of this practice, metallurgists use a
modiﬁedformofthePhaseRuleequationi.e. PCFD
CC1.
Nevertheless, it is possible for vapour pressure to be
a highly signiﬁcant factor in alloy systems formed by
volatile components such as mercury, zinc, cadmiumand magnesium: in such cases, it is advisable to takeadvantage of full pressure-temperature diagrams. Fur-
thermore, the partial pressures of certain gases in a
contacting atmosphere can be highly signiﬁcant and at
elevated temperatures can contribute to serious corro-sion of metals (e.g. O
2,S2(Chapter 12)). Again, the
pressure variable must be taken into account.
3.2.3 Stability of phases
3.2.3.1 The concept of free energy
Every material in a given state has a characteristic
heat content or enthalpy, H, and the rate of change of
heat content with temperature is equal to the speciﬁc
heat of the material measured at constant pressure,C
PD⊿dH/dT/triangleleftp. A knowledge of the quantity His
clearly important to understand reactions but it does
not provide a criterion for equilibrium, nor does it
determine when a phase change occurs, as shown bythe occurrence of both exothermic and endothermicreactions. To provide this criterion it is necessary to
consider a second important property of state known
astheentropy, S.Instatisticalterms Smayberegarded
as a measure of the state of disorder of the structure,but from classical thermodynamics it may be shown
that for any material passing through a complete cycle

where d Qis the heat exchanged between the system
and its surroundings during each inﬁnitesimal step andTis the temperature at which the transfer takes place.
It is then convenient to deﬁne a quantity Ssuch that

where Sis the entropy at TK usually measured
in J K/NUL1. The integration constant S0represents the
entropy at absolute zero, which for an ordered crys-talline substance is taken to be zero; this is oftenquoted as the third law of thermodynamics. Clearly,any reaction or transformation within a system will beassociated with a characteristic entropy change givenby
dSDS
ˇ/NULS˛
where d Sis the entropy of transformation and Sˇand
S˛are the entropy values of the new phase ˇand
the old phase ˛, respectively. It is a consequence of
this that any irreversible change which takes place ina system (e.g. the combustion of a metal) must beaccompanied by an increase in the total entropy of thesystem. This is commonly known as the second lawof thermodynamics.
The quantity entropy could be used for deciding the
equilibrium state of a system, but it is much moreconvenient to work in terms of energy. Accordingly,it is usual to deal with the quantity TS, which has
the units of energy, rather than just S, and to separate
the total energy of the system Hinto two components
according to the relation
HDGCTS
where Gis that part of the energy of the system which
causes the process to occur and TSis the energy
requirement resulting from the change involved. ThetermGis known as Gibbs’ free energy and is deﬁned
by the equation
GDH/NULTS
Every material in a given state will have a charac-
teristic value of G. The change of free energy accom-
panying a change represents the ‘driving force’ of thechange, and is given by the expression
dGDdH/NULTdS/DC1dECPdV/NULTdSAll spontaneous changes in a system must be accom-
panied by a reduction of the total free energy of that
system, and thus for a change to occur the free energychange Gmust be negative. It also follows that the
equilibrium condition of a reaction will correspond to
the state where d GD0, i.e. zero driving force.
For solids and liquids at atmospheric pressure the
volume change accompanying changes of state is verysmall and hence PdVis also very small. It is therefore
reasonable to neglect this term in the free energy
equation and use as the criterion of equilibrium d E/NUL
TdSD0. This is equivalent to deﬁning the quantity
⊿E/NULTS/triangleleftto be a minimum in the equilibrium state,
for by differentiation

the symbol F, the Helmholtz free energy ⊿FDE/NUL

state it is thus a reasonable approximation to use Fin

and external energies which reduces to H'Ewhen
the external energy PVis neglected.
3.2.3.2 Free energy and temperature
If a metal undergoes a structural change from phase ˛
to phase ˇat a temperature Ttthen it does so because
above this temperature the free energy of the ˇphase,
Gˇ,becomeslowerthanthefree energyofthe ˛phase,
G˛. For this to occur the free energy curves must vary
with temperature in the manner shown in Figure 3.9a.
It can be seen that at Ttthe free energy of the ˛-phase
is equal to that of the ˇ-phase so that Gis zero; Tt
is, therefore, the equilibrium transformation point.
Figure 3.9a also shows that successive transforma-
tions occur in a given temperature range. The way in
which the absolute value of the free energy of a crystalvarieswithtemperatureisshowninFigure 3.9b,whereHand/NULTSareplottedasafunctionoftemperature.At

energy is the stable phase.

Thisarises because over andabove the entropiesof the
pure components A and B, the solution of B in A has
an extra entropy due to the numerous ways in which
the two kinds of atoms can be arranged amongst each
other.Thisentropyofdisorderormixingisoftheform

As a measure of the disorder of a given state we
can, purely from statistics, consider Wthe number of
distributions which belong to that state. Thus, if the

3.2.4.1 Extended and limited solid solubility
Solid solubility is a feature of many metallic and
ceramic systems,beingfavouredwhenthecomponents
have similarities in crystal structure and atomic (ionic)
diameter. Such solubilitymay be either extended (con-tinuous) or limited. The former case is illustrated bythebinaryphasediagramforthenickel–coppersystem
(Figure 3.12) in which the solid solution ( ˛) extends

abrupt (congruent) melting points of the pure metals,the intervening alloys freeze, or fuse, over a range oftemperatureswhichisassociatedwithaunivarianttwo-phase ⊿˛Cliquid /triangleleftﬁeld. This ‘pasty’ zone is located
between two lines known as the liquidus and solidus.
(The phase diagrams for Ni–Cu and MgO–FeO sys-
tems are similar in form.)
Let us consider the very slow (equilibrating) solidi-
ﬁcation of a 70Ni–30Cu alloy. A commercial versionof this alloy, Monel, also contains small amounts of
iron and manganese. It is strong, ductile and resistscorrosion by all forms of water, including sea-water(e.g. chemical and food processing, water treatment).An ordinate is erected from its average compositiononthe base line. Freezing starts at a temperature T

pleted as the composition ˛3of the crystals coincides
with the average composition of the alloy. It will be
seen that the compositions of the ˛-phase and liquid
have moved down the solidus and liquidus, respec-tively, during freezing.
Each tie-line joins two points which represent two
phase compositions. One might visualize that a two-phase region in a binary diagram is made up of an inﬁ-nite number of horizontal (isothermal) tie-lines. Usingthe average alloy composition as a fulcrum ( x)a n d
applyingtheLeverRule,itisquicklypossibletoderive

mass ratios and fractions. For instance, for equilibrium
at temperature T2in Figure 3.12, the mass ratio of
solid solution crystals to liquid is xL2/˛2x. Similarly,
the mass fraction of solid in the two-phase mixture atthis temperature is xL
2/L2˛2. Clearly, the phase com-
positions are of greater structural signiﬁcance than the
average composition of the alloy. If the volumetricrelations of two phases are required, these being whatwe naturally assess in microscopy, then the above val-
ues must be corrected for phase density.
In most systems, solid solubility is far more
restricted and is often conﬁned to the phase ﬁeldadjacent to the end-component. A portion of a binaryphasediagramforthecopper–berylliumsystem,which
contains a primary, or terminal, solid solution, is
shown in Figure 3.13. Typically, the curving lineknown as the solvus shows an increase in theability of the solvent copper to dissolve beryllium
solute as the temperature is raised. If a typical
‘beryllium–copper’ containing 2% beryllium is ﬁrstheld at a temperature just below the solidus (solution-treated), water-quenched to preserve the ˛-phase and
then aged at a temperature of 425
°C, particles of
a second phase ( /CR) will form within the ˛-phase
matrix because the alloy is equilibrating in the ⊿˛C/CR/triangleleft
ﬁeld of the diagram. This type of treatment, closelycontrolled, is known as precipitation-hardening; the
mechanism of this important strengthening process
will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8. Precipitation-hardening of a typical beryllium–copper, which alsocontains up to 0.5% cobalt or nickel, can raise the
0.1% proof stress to 1200 MN m
/NUL2and the tensile
strength to 1400 MN m/NUL2. Apart from being suitable
for non-sparking tools, it is a valuable spring material,beingprincipallyusedforelectricallyconductivebrushsprings and contact ﬁngers in electrical switches.
A curving solvus is an essential feature of phase
diagrams for precipitation-hardenable alloys (e.g.aluminium–copper alloys ( Duralumin )).
When solid-state precipitation takes place, say
ofˇwithin a matrix of supersaturated ˛grains,
this precipitation occurs in one or more of thefollowing preferred locations: (1) at grain boundaries,(2) around dislocations and inclusions, and (3) onspeciﬁc crystallographic planes. The choice of site
for precipitation depends on several factors, of which
grain size and rate of nucleation are particularlyimportant.Ifthegrainsizeislarge,theamountofgrainboundary surface is relatively small, and deposition
ofˇ-phase within the grains is favoured. When this
precipitation occurs preferentially on certain sets ofcrystallographic planes within the grains, the etchedstructure has a mesh-like appearance which is known
as a Widmanst ¨atten-type structure.
1Widmanst ¨atten
structures have been observed in many alloys (e.g.overheated steels).

discovered this morphology within an iron–nickel meteoritesample in 1808.

3.2.4.2 Coring
It is now possible to consider microsegregation, a phe-
nomenon introduced in Section 3.1.4, in more detail.
Referring again to the freezing process for a Ni–Cu
alloy (Figure 3.12), it is clear that the composition ofthe˛-phase becomes progressively richer in copper
and, consequently, if equilibrium is to be maintained
in the alloy, the two phases must continuously adjust
their compositions by atomic migration. In the liquid
phase such diffusion is relatively rapid. Under indus-trial conditions, the cooling rate of the solid phase is
often too rapid to allow complete elimination of dif-
ferences in composition by diffusion. Each grain ofthe˛-phase will thus contain composition gradients
between the core, which will be unduly rich in the
metal of higher melting point, and the outer regions,
whichwillbeundulyrichinthemetaloflowermelting
point. Such a non-uniform solid solution is said to becored: etching of a polishedspecimen can reveal a pat-
tern of dendritic segregation within each cored grain.
The faster the rate of cooling, the more pronouncedwill be the degree of coring. Coring in chill-cast ingots
is, therefore, quite extensive.
The physical and chemical hetereogeneity produced
by non-equilibrium cooling rates impairs properties.
Cored structures can be homogenized by annealing.For instance, an ingot may be heated to a temperature
just below the solidus temperature where diffusion
is rapid. The temperature must be selected with
54Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
care because some regions might be rich enough in
low melting point metal to cause localized fusion.
However, when practicable, it is more effectiveto cold-work a cored structure before annealing.
This treatment has three advantages. First, dendritic
s t r u c t u r e sa r eb r o k e nu pb yd e f o r m a t i o ns ot h a tregions of different composition are intermingled,reducing the distances over which diffusion must
take place. Second, defects introduced by deformation
accelerate rates of diffusion during the subsequentanneal. Third, deformation promotes recrystallization
during subsequent annealing, making it more likely
that the cast structure will be completely replaced bya generation of new equiaxed grains. Hot-working isalso capable of eliminating coring.
3.2.4.3 Cellular microsegregation
In the case of a solid solution, we have seen that itis possible for solvent atoms to tend to freeze beforesolute atoms, causing gradual solute enrichment ofan alloy melt and, under non-equilibrium conditions,
dendritic coring (e.g. Ni–Cu). When a very dilute
alloy melt or impure metal freezes, it is possible foreach crystal to develop a regular cell structure on a
ﬁner scale than coring. The thermal and compositional
conditionresponsibleforthiscellularmicrosegregationis referred to as constitutional undercooling.
Suppose that a melt containing a small amount
of lower-m.p. solute is freezing. The liquid becomes
increasingly enriched in rejected solute atoms, partic-ularly close to the moving solid/liquid interface. The
variation of liquid composition with distance from
Figure 3.14 Variation with distance from solid/liquid
interface of (a) melt composition and (b) actual temperature
T and freezing temperature TL.the interface is shown in Figure 3.14a. There is a
corresponding variation with distance of the temper-
ature TLat which the liquid will freeze, since solute
atoms lower the freezing temperature. Consequently,
for the positive gradient of melt temperature Tshown
in Figure 3.14b, there is a layer of liquid in which the
actual temperature Tis below the freezing temperature
TL: this layer is constitutionally undercooled. Clearly,
the depth of the undercooled zone, as measured from
the point of intersection, will depend upon the slopeof the curve for actual temperature, i.e. G
LDdT/dx.
AsGLdecreases, the degree of constitutional under-
cooling will increase.
Supposethatwevisualizea tie-linethroughthetwo-
phase region of the phase diagram fairly close to thecomponent of higher m.p. Assuming equilibrium, a
partition or distribution coefﬁcient kcan be deﬁned
as the ratio of solute concentration in the solid to that
in the liquid, i.e. c
S/cL. For an alloy of average com-
position c0, the solute concentration in the ﬁrst solid to
freeze is kc0,w h e r e k<1, and the liquid adjacent to
the solid becomes richer in solute than c0. The next
solid to freeze will have a higher concentration of
solute. Eventually, for a constant rate of growth of
the solid/liquid interface, a steady state is reached forwhich the solute concentration at the interface reaches
a limiting value of c
0/kand decreases exponentially
within the liquid to the bulk composition. This con-
centration proﬁle is shown in Figure 3.14a.

The presence of a zone of undercooled liquid
aheadofamacroscopicallyplanarsolid/liquidinterface
(Section 3.1.2) makes it unstable and an interface with
cellular morphology develops. The interface growslocally into the liquid from a regular array of points on
its surface, forming dome-shaped cells. Figures 3.15a
and 3.15b show the development of domes within a
metallic melt. As each cell grows by rapid freezing,
soluteatoms are rejected intothe liquidarounditsbasewhich thus remains unfrozen. This solute-rich liquid
between the cells eventually freezes at a much lower
temperature and a crystal with a periodic columnar
cell structure is produced. Solute or impurity atoms
are concentrated in the cell walls. Decantation ofa partly-solidi ﬁed melt will reveal the characteristic
surface structure shown in Figure 3.15c. The cells
of metals are usually hexagonal in cross-section and
about 0.05 –1 mm across: for each grain, their major
axes have the same crystallographic orientation to
within a few minutes of arc. It is often found that

of sub-structure is coarser in scale.
Different morphologies of a constitutionally-
cooled surface, other than cellular, are possible.
A typical overall sequence of observed growthforms is planar/cellular/cellular dendritic/dendritic.
Substructures produced by constitutional undercooling
have been observed in ‘doped’single crystals and
in ferrous and non-ferrous castings/weldments.

Causeway, Northern Ireland.the extent of undercooling into the liquid is increased
as, for example, by reducing the temperature gradient
GL, the cellular structure becomes unstable and a few
cells grow rapidly as cellular dendrites. The branches
of the dendrites are interconnected and are an extreme
development of the dome-shaped bulges of the cell
structure in directions of rapid growth. The growth ofdendrites in a very dilute, constitutionally-undercooled
alloy is slower than in a pure metal because solute
atoms must diffuse away from dendrite/liquid surfaces
and also because their growth is limited to the
undercooled zone. Cellular impurity-generated sub-
structureshavealsobeen observedin ‘non-metals ’as a

3.2.4.4 Zone-re ﬁning
Extreme puri ﬁcation of a metal can radically improve
properties such as ductility, strength and corrosion-
resistance. Zone-re ﬁning was devised by W. G. Pfann,
its development being ‘driven’by the demands of the
newly invented transistor for homogeneous and ultra-
pure metals (e.g. Si, Ge). The method takes advantage
of non-equilibrium effects associated with the ‘pasty’
zone separating the liquidus and solidus of impure
metal. Considering the portion of Figure 3.12 where
addition of solute lowers the liquidus temperature,
the concentration of solute in the liquid, cL, will
always be greater than its concentration csin the
solid phase; that is, the distribution coef ﬁcient kD
cs/cLis less than unity. If a bar of impure metal
is threaded through a heating coil and the coil is
slowly moved, a narrow zone of melt can be made
to progress along the bar. The ﬁrst solid to freeze is
56Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
purer than the average composition by a factor of k,
while that which freezes last, at the trailing interface,is correspondingly enriched in solute. A net movement
of impurity atoms to one end of the bar takes place.
Repeated traversing of the bar with a set of coilscan reduce the impurity content well below the limit
of detection (e.g. <1p a r ti n1 0
10for germanium).
Crystal defects are also eliminated: Pfann reducedthe dislocation density in metallic and semi-metallic
crystals from about 3 .5ð10
6cm/NUL2to almost zero.

3.2.5 Three-phase equilibria and reactions
3.2.5.1 The eutectic reaction
In many metallic and ceramic binary systems it is
possible for two crystalline phases and a liquid to co-
exist. The modiﬁed Phase Rule reveals that this uniquecondition is invariant; that is, the temperature andall phase compositions have ﬁxed values. Figure 3.16
shows the phase diagram for the lead–tin system.
It will be seen that solid solubility is limited foreach of the two component metals, with ˛andˇ
representingprimarysolidsolutionsofdifferentcrystal
structure.Astraightline,theeutectichorizontal,passes
throughthree phasecompositions( ˛
e,Leandˇe)a tt h e
temperature Te. As will become clear when ternary
systems are discussed (Section 3.2.9), this line is a
collapsed three-phase triangle: at any point on this
line, three phases are in equilibrium. During slowcooling or heating, when the average composition ofan alloy lies between its limits, ˛
eandˇe, a eutectic
reaction takes place in accordance with the equation
Le/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf˛eCˇe. The sharply-deﬁned minimum in the
liquidus, the eutectic (easy-melting) point, is a typicalfeature of the reaction.
Considerthefreezingofamelt,averagecomposition
37Pb–63Sn. At the temperature T
eof approximately
180°C, it freezes abruptly to form a mechanical mix-
ture of two solid phases, i.e. Liquid Le!˛eCˇe.
From the Lever Rule, the ˛/ˇmass ratio is approx-
imately 9:11. As the temperature falls further, slow
cooling will allow the compositions of the two phasesto follow their respective solvus lines. Tie-lines acrossthis⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftﬁeld will provide the mass ratio for any
temperature. In contrast, a hypoeutectic alloy melt, say
of composition70Pb–30Sn,willform primary crystals
of˛over a range of temperature until T
eis reached.
Successive tie-lines across the ⊿˛CLiquid /triangleleftﬁeld show
that the crystals and the liquid become enriched in tin
as the temperature falls. When the liquid composition
reaches the eutectic value Le, all of the remaining liq-
uid transforms into a two-phase mixture, as before.However, for this alloy, the ﬁnal structure will com-
prise primary grains of ˛in a eutectic matrix of ˛and
ˇ. Similarly, one may deduce that the structure of a
solidiﬁed hyper-eutectic alloy containing 30Pb–70Snwill consist of a few primary ˇgrains in a eutectic
matrix of ˛andˇ.
Low-lead or low-tin alloys, with average composi-
tions beyond the two ends of the eutectic horizontal,
1
freeze by transforming completely over a small range
of temperature into a primary phase. (Changes in com-position are similar in character to those described
for Figure 3.12) When the temperature ‘crosses’ the
relevant solvus, this primary phase becomes unsta-ble and a small amount of second phase precipitates.Final proportions of the two phases can be obtainedby superimposing a tie-line on the central two-phaseﬁeld: there will be no signs of a eutectic mixture in
the microstructure.

(70Pb–30Sn) alloys chosen for the description of

used for joining metals. Eutectic solders containing
60–65% tin are widely used in the electronics industryfor making precise, high-integrity joints on a mass-production scale without the risk of damaging heat-sensitive components. These solders have excellent
‘wetting’ properties (contact angle <10
°), a low
liquidus and a negligible freezing range. The longfreezing range of the 70Pb–30Sn alloy (plumbers’solder) enables the solder at a jointto be ‘wiped’ while‘pasty’.
Theshearstrengthofthemostwidely-usedsoldersis
relativelylow,say25–55 MN m
/NUL2,andmechanically-
interlocking joints are often used. Fluxes (corrosivezinc chloride, non-corrosive organic resins) facilitate
essential ‘wetting’ of the metal to be joined by dis-
solving thin oxide ﬁlms and preventing re-oxidation.Inelectronicapplications,minutesolderpreformshavebeen used to solve the problems of excess solder andﬂux.
Figure 3.16 shows the sequence of structures
obtained across the breadth of the Pb–Sn system.
Cooling curves for typical hypo-eutectic and eutecticalloys are shown schematically in Figure 3.17a.Separation of primary crystals produces a change inslope while heat is being evolved. Much more heatis evolved when the eutectic reaction takes place.The lengths (duration) of the plateaux are proportional
to the amounts of eutectic structure formed, as
summarized in Figure 3.17b. Although it follows thatcooling curves can be used to determine the form ofsuch a simple system, it is usual to conﬁrm details bymeans ofmicroscopical examination(optical,scanningelectron) and X-ray diffraction analysis.
1Theoretically, the eutectic horizontal cannot cut the vertical
line representing a pure component: some degree of solid
solubility, however small, always occurs.
2Soft solders for engineering purposes range in composition
from 20% to 65% tin; the ﬁrst standard speciﬁcations for
solders were produced in 1918 by the ASTM. The USA is
currently contemplating the banning of lead-bearing
products; lead-free solders are being sought.

3.2.5.2 The peritectic reaction
Whereas eutectic systems often occur when the melt-
ing pointsof the two componentsare fairly similar, the
second important type of invariant three-phase condi-
tion, the peritectic reaction, is often found when the
components have a large difference in melting points.Usually they occur in the more complicated systems;
for instance, there is a cascade of ﬁve peritectic reac-tions in the Cu–Zn system (Figure 3.20).
A simple form of peritectic system is shown in,
Figure 3.18a; although relatively rare in practice (e.g.Ag–Pt), it can serve to illustrate the basic principles.
58Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Figure 3.18 (a) Simple peritectic system; (b) development of a peritectic ‘wall’ .
A horizontal line, the key to the reaction, links
three critical phase compositions; that is, ˛p,ˇpand
liquid Lp. A peritectic reaction occurs if the average
composition of the alloy crosses this line during either
slow heating or cooling. It can be represented by the
equation ˛pCLp/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfˇp. Binary alloys containing less
of component B than the point ˛pwill behave in the
manner previously described for solid solutions. A
meltofalloy 1,whichisofperitecticcomposition,willfreeze over a range of temperature, depositing crystals
of primary ˛-phase. The melt composition will move
down the liquidus, becoming richer in component B.
At the peritectic temperature T

Lpwill react with these primary crystals, transforming
them completely into a new phase, ˇ, of different
crystal structure in accordance with the equation ˛pC

further cooling. Alloy 2 will aso deposit primary ˛,
but the reaction at temperature Tpwill not consume
all these crystals and the ﬁnal solid will consist of ˇ
formed by peritectic reaction and residual ˛. Initially,
the˛/ˇmass ratio will be approximately 2.5 to 1
but both phases will adjust their compositions during
subsequent cooling. In the case of alloy 3, fewer
primary crystals of ˛form: later, they are completely
destroyed by the peritectic reaction. The amount of ˇ
in the resultant mixture of ˇand liquid increases until
the liquid disappears and an entire structure of ˇis
produced.
The above descriptions assume that equilibrium is
attained at each stage of cooling. Although very slow
cooling is unlikely in practice, the nature of the peri-
tectic reaction introduces a further complication. Thereaction product ˇtends to form a shell around the
particles of primary ˛: its presence obviously inhibits
the exchange of atoms by diffusion which equilibrium
demands (Figure 3.18b).3.2.5.3 Classiﬁcation of three-phase equilibria
The principal invariant equilibria involving three con-densed (solid, liquid) phases can be conveniently
divided into eutectic- and peritectic-types and classi-ﬁedinthemannershowninTable 3.1.Interpretationofthesereactionsfollowsthemethodologyalreadysetout
for the more common eutectic and peritectic reactions.
Theinverserelationbetweeneutectic-andperitectic-
type reactions is apparent from the line diagrams.Eutectoid and peritectoid reactions occur wholly in the
solid state. (The eutectoid reaction /CR/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf˛CFe

the basis of the heat-treatment of steels.) In all thesystems so far described, the components have beencompletely miscible in the liquid state. In monotectic
and syntectic systems, the liquid phase ﬁeld contains
a region in which two different liquids ( L
1andL2)a r e
immiscible.
3.2.6 Intermediate phases
An intermediate phase differs in crystal structure fromthe primary phases and lies between them in a phase
diagram. In Figure 3.19, which shows the diagram
for the Mg–Si system, Mg
2Si is the intermediate
phase. Sometimes intermediate phases have deﬁnitestoichiometric ratios of constituent atoms and appear
as a single vertical line in the diagram. However,
they frequently exist over a range of composition andit is therefore generally advisable to avoid the term‘compound’.
In some diagrams, such as Figure 3.19, they extend
from room temperature to the liquidus and melt orfreeze without any change in composition. Such a
melting point is said to be congruent: the melting
point of a eutectic alloy is incongruent. A congruentlymelting phase provides a convenient means to dividea complex phase diagram (binary or ternary) into
more readily understandable parts. For instance, an

Figure 3.19 produces two simple eutectic sub-systems.
Similarly, an ordinate can be erected to pass through
the minimum (or maximum) of the liquidus of a solidsolution (Figure 3.38b).
In general, intermediate phases are hard and brittle,
having a complex crystal structure (e.g. Fe
3C, CuAl 2
(/DC2)). For instance, it is advisable to restrict time andtemperature when soldering copper alloys, otherwise it
is possible for undesirable brittle layers of Cu 3Sn and
Cu6Sn5to form at the interface.
3.2.7 Limitations of phase diagrams
Phase diagrams are extremely useful in the interpre-tation of metallic and ceramic structures but they are
60Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
subject to several restriction. Primarily, they identify
whichphases are likelytobe present and providecom-positionaldata. The most serious limitationis that they
givenoinformationonthestructuralformanddistribu-
tion of phases (e.g. lamellae, spheroids, intergranular
ﬁlms, etc.). This is unfortunate, since these two fea-
tures, which depend upon the surface energy effects
between different phases and strain energy effects due
to volume and shape changes during transformations,play an important role in the mechanical behaviour
of materials. This is understood if we consider a two-
phase ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftmaterial containingonlya small amount
ofˇ-phase. The ˇ-phase may be dispersed evenly as
particles throughout the ˛-grains, in which case the
mechanical properties of the material would be largely
governed by those of the ˛-phase. However, if the ˇ-
phase is concentrated at grain boundary surfaces of the
˛-phase, then the mechanical behaviour of the mate-
rial will be largely dictated by the properties of the
ˇ-phase. For instance, small amounts of sulphide par-
ticles, such as grey manganese sulphide (MnS), are
usually tolerable in steels but sulphide ﬁlms at the
grain boundaries cause unacceptable embrittlement.
A second limitation is that phase diagrams por-
tray only equilibrium states. As indicated in previous
sections, alloys are rarely cooled or heated at very
slow rates. For instance, quenching, as practised in the
heat-treatmentofsteels,canproducemetastablephases
known as martensite and bainite that will then remain
unchanged at room temperature. Neither appears inphase diagrams. In such cases it is necessary to devise
methods for expressing the rate at which equilibrium
is approached and its temperature-dependency.
3.2.8 Some key phase diagrams
3.2.8.1 Copper –zinc system
Phase diagrams for most systems, metallic and
ceramic, are usually more complex than the examplesdiscussed so far. Figure 3.20 for the Cu –Zn system
illustrates this point. The structural characteristics and
mechanical behaviour of the industrial alloys known
as brasses can be understood in terms of the copper-
rich end of this diagram. Copper can dissolve up to
40% w/wofzincand coolingofanyalloyinthisrange
will produce an extensive primary solid solution (fcc-˛). By contrast, the other primary solid solution ( /DC1)i s
extremely limited. A special feature of the diagram is
the presence of four intermediate phases ( ˇ,/CR,υ,ε).
Each is formed during freezing by peritectic reaction
and each exists over a range of composition. Another
notable feature is the order –disorder transformation
which occurs in alloys containing about 50% zincover the temperature range 450 –470
°C. Above this
temperature range, bcc ˇ-phase exists as a disordered
solid solution. At lower temperatures, the zinc atoms
are distributed regularly on the bcc lattice: this ordered
phase is denoted by ˇ0.
Suppose that two thin plates of copper and zinc are
held in very close contact and heated at a temperature

˛/ˇ//CR/ε//DC1, separated from each other by a planar inter-
face. The υ-phase will be absent because it is unstable
at temperatures below itseutectoid horizontal ⊿560°C/triangleleft.
Continuation of diffusion will eventually produce oneor two phases, depending on the original proportionsof copper and zinc.
3.2.8.2 Iron –carbon system
The diagram for the part of the Fe –C system shown
in Figure 3.21 is the basis for understanding themicrostructures of the ferrous alloys known as steelsand cast irons. Dissolved carbon clearly has a pro-nounced effect upon the liquidus, explaining why thedifﬁculty of achieving furnace temperatures of 1600
°C
caused large-scale production of cast irons to predatethat of steel. The three allotropes of pure iron are ˛-Fe
(bcc), /CR-Fe (fcc) and υ-Fe (bcc).
1Small atoms of car-
bon dissolve interstitially in these allotropes to form
three primary solid solutions: respectively, they are ˛-
phase (ferrite), /CR-phase (austenite) and υ-phase. At the
other end of the diagram is the orthorhombic interme-diate phase Fe
3C, which is known as cementite.
The large difference in solid solubility of carbon
in austenite and ferrite, together with the existence ofa eutectoid reaction, are responsible for the versatilebehaviour of steels during heat-treatment. Ae
1,A e2,
Ae3and Acmindicate the temperatures at which phase
changes occur: they are arrest points for equilibria
detected during thermal analysis. For instance, slow
cooling enables austenite (0.8% C) to decomposeeutectoidally at the temperature Ae

microconstituent pearlite, a lamellar composite of soft,

ductile ferrite (initially 0.025% C) and hard, brittle
cementite (6.67% C). Quenching of austenite from atemperature above Ae
3forms a hard metastable phase
known as martensite. From the diagram one can seewhy a medium-carbon (0.4%) steel must be quenchedfrom a higher Ae
3temperature than a high-carbon
(0.8%) steel. Temperature and composition ‘windows’
for some important heat-treatment operations havebeen superimposed upon the phase diagram.
3.2.8.3 Copper–lead system
ThephasediagramfortheCu–Pbsystem(Figure3.22)provides an interesting example of extremely limited
solubility in the solid state and partial immiscibility
in the liquid state. The two components differ greatlyin density and melting point. Solid solutions, ˛and
ˇ, exist at the ends of the diagram. The ‘miscibility
gap’ in the liquid phase takes the form of a dome-shaped two-phase ⊿L
1CL2/triangleleftﬁeld. At temperatures
above the top of the dome, the critical point,liquid miscibility is complete. The upper isothermal
represents a monotectic reaction, i.e. L1/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf˛CL2.
On cooling, a hyper-monotectic 50Cu–50Pb melt
will separate into two liquids of different composition.
The degree of separation depends on cooling condi-
tions. Like oil and water, the two liquids may form an
emulsion of droplets or separate into layers accordingto density. At a temperature of 954
°C, the copper-rich
liquid L1disappears, forming ˛crystals and more of
the lead-rich liquid L2. This liquid phase gets richer
in lead and eventually decomposes by eutectic reac-
tion, i.e. L2/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf˛Cˇ. (Tie-lines can be used for all
two-phase ﬁelds, of course; however, because of den-
sity differences, mass ratios may differ greatly from
observed volume ratios.)

refractory arc-resistant metal (W, Mo, Ni) have
been used for electrical contacts (e.g. 60Ag–40Ni).
These particular monotectic systems, with their liquid
immiscibility, are difﬁcult to cast and are thereforemade by powder metallurgy techniques.
3.2.8.4 Alumina–silica system
The binary phase diagram for alumina–silica
(Figure 3.23) is of special relevance to the refractories

possible. The proﬁle of its liquidus shows a minimum
and thus mirrors the refractoriness of aluminosilicaterefractories (Figure 3.24). Refractoriness, the prime
requirement of a refractory, is commonly determined
by an empirical laboratory test. A sample cone of agiven refractory is placed on a plaque and located at
the centre of a ring of standard cones, each of which
has a different softening or slumping temperature andis identiﬁed by a Pyrometric Cone Equivalent (PCE)
number. All cones are then slowly heated until the

sample cone bends or slumps under gravity: the PCE
of a standard cone that has behaved similarly is notedand taken to represent the refractoriness of the sample.It will be realized that the end-point of the PCE testis rather arbitrary, being a rising-temperature value.(Other requirements may include refractoriness-under-load, resistance to thermal shock, resistance to attackby molten slag, low thermal conductivity, etc.)
The steeply-descending liquidus shows the adverse
effect of a few per cent of alumina on the refractori-ness of silica bricks. (Sodium oxide, Na
2O, has an
even more pronounced eutectic-forming effect and iscommonly used to ﬂux sand particles during glass-melting.) The discovery of this eutectic point led toimmediate efforts to keep the alumina content as farbelow 5% as possible. Silica refractories are made byﬁring size-graded quartzite grains and a small amountof lime (CaO) ﬂux at a temperature of 1450
°C: the
ﬁnal structure consists of tridymite, cristobalite and a
minimal amount of unconverted quartz. Tridymite ispreferred to cristobalite because of the large volumechange ( ¾1%) associated with the ˛/ˇcristobalite
inversion. The lime forms an intergranular bond of
SiO
2–CaO glass. Chequerwork assemblies of silica
bricks are used in hot-blast stoves that regenerativelypreheat combustion air for iron-making blast furnacesto temperatures of 1200–1300
°C. Silica bricks have
a surprisingly good refractoriness-under-load at tem-
peratures only 50 °C or so below the melting point
of pure silica 1723 °C/triangleleft. Apparently, the ﬁred grains
of tridymite and cristobalite interlock, being able to
withstand a compressive stress of, say, 0.35 MN m/NUL2
at these high temperature levels.
Firebricks made from carefully-selected low-iron
clays are traditionallyused for furnace-building. These
clays consist essentially of minute platey crystals
of kaolinite, Al 2⊿Si2O5/triangleleft⊿OH/triangleleft4: the (OH) groups are
expelled during ﬁring. The alumina content (46%)of ﬁred kaolinite sets the upper limit of the normalcomposition range for ﬁrebricks. Refractoriness rises
steeply with alumina content and aluminous ﬁreclays
containing 40% or more of alumina are therefore par-ticularly valued. A ﬁreclay suitable for refractoriesshould have a PCE of at least 30 (equivalent to1670
°C): with aluminous clays the PCE can rise
to 35 ⊿1770°C/triangleleft. Firing the clay at temperatures of
1200–1400 °C forms a glassy bond and an interlock-
ing mass of very small lath-like crystals of mullite;this is the intermediate phase with a narrow range ofcomposition which marks the edge of the important
⊿mullite Ccorundum /triangleleftplateau. High-alumina bricks,
with their better refractoriness, have tended to replaceﬁrebricks. An appropriate raw material is obtainedby taking clay and adding alumina (bauxite, artiﬁ-
cialcorundum)ora‘sillimanite-type’mineral,Al
2SiO5
(andalusite, sillimanite, kyanite).
Phase transformations in ceramic systems are
generally more sluggish than in metallic systems andsteep concentration gradients can be present on a
micro-scale. Thus tie-lines across the silica–mullite
ﬁeld usually only give approximate proportions ofthese two phases. The presence of traces of catalysingmineralizers, such as lime, can make application of thediagram nominal rather than rigorous. For instance,
although silica bricks are ﬁred at a temperature of
1450
°C,whichiswithinthestabilityrangeoftridymite
⊿870–1470 °C/triangleleft, cristobalite is able to form in quantity.
However, during service, true stability is approachedand a silica brick operating in a temperature gradient
will develop clearly-deﬁned and separate zones of
tridymite and cristobalite.
By tradition, refractories are often said to be acid
or basic, indicating their suitability for operation incontact with acid (SiO
2-rich) or basic (CaO- or FeO-
rich) slags. For instance, suppose that conditions are
reducing and the lower oxide of iron, FeO, formsin a basic steel-making slag ⊿1600
°C/triangleleft. ‘Acid’ silica
64Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
refractory will be rapidly destroyed because this fer-
rous oxide reacts with silica to form fayalite, Fe 2SiO4,
which has a melting point of 1180 °C. (The SiO 2–FeO
phase diagram shows a sudden fall in the liquidus.)
However, in certain cases, this approach is scientiﬁ-cally inadequate. For instance, ‘acid’ silica also has a
surprising tolerance for basic CaO-rich slags. Refer-
ence to the SiO
2–CaO diagram reveals that there is a
monotectic plateau at its silica-rich end, a feature that
is preferable to a steeply descending liquidus. Its exis-tence accounts for the slower rate of attack by molten

3.2.8.5 Nickel–sulphur–oxygen and
chromium–sulphur–oxygen systems
The hot corrosion of superalloys based upon nickel,
iron or cobalt by ﬂue or exhaust gases from the
combustion of sulphur-containing fuels is a problemcommon to a number of industries (e.g. power
generation). These gases contain nitrogen, oxygen
(excess to stoichiometric combustion requirements),carbon dioxide, water vapour, sulphur dioxide, sulphur
trioxide, etc. In the case of a nickel-based alloy, the
principal corrosive agents are sulphur and oxygen.
They form nickel oxide and/or sulphide phases at the
ﬂue gas/alloy interface: their presence represents metalwastage. A phase diagram for the Ni–S–O system,
which makes due allowance for the pressure variables,
providesavaluableinsightintothethermochemistryofattack of a Ni-based superalloy. Althoughdisregarding
kinetic factors, such as diffusion, a stability diagram
of this type greatly helps understanding of underlying
mechanisms. Primarily, it indicates which phases are
likely to form. Application of these diagrams to hotcorrosion phenomena is discussed in Chapter 12.
Under equilibrium conditions, the variables gov-
erning chemical reaction at a nickel/gas interface aretemperature and the partial pressures p
o2andps2for
the gas phase. For isothermal conditions, the gen-
eral disposition of phases will be as shown schemat-ically in Figure 3.25a. An isothermal section (900 K)
is depicted in Figure 3.25b. A comprehensive three-
dimensional representation, based upon standard free
energy data for the various competing reactions,
is given in Figure 3.26. Section AAis isothermal
(1200 K): the full diagram may be regarded as a par-
allel stacking of an inﬁnite number of such vertical
sections. From the Phase Rule, PCFDCC2, it fol-
lows that FD5/NULP. Hence, for equilibrium between
gas and one condensed phase, there are three degrees
of freedom and equilibrium is represented by a vol-
ume. Similarly, equilibrium between gas and three
condensed phases is represented by a line. The bivari-ant and univariant equilibrium equations which form
the basis of the three-dimensional stabilitydiagram are
given in Figure 3.26.

3.2.9 Ternary phase diagrams
3.2.9.1 The ternary prism
Phase diagrams for three-component systems usually
take the standard form of a prism which combines anequilateral triangular base (ABC) with three binarysystem ‘walls’ (A–B, B–C, C–A), as shown inFigure 3.27a. This three-dimensional form allows thethree independent variables to be speciﬁed, i.e. twocomponent concentrations and temperature. As thediagram is isobaric, the modiﬁed Phase Rule applies.The vertical edges can represent pure components ofeither metallic or ceramic systems. Isothermal contourlines are helpful means for indicating the curvature ofliquidus and solidus surfaces.
Figure 3.27b shows some of the ways in which the
base of the prism, the Gibbs triangle, is used. Forinstance, the recommended method for deriving thecomposition of a point P representing a ternary alloyis to draw two construction lines to cut the nearestof the three binary composition scales. In similarfashion, the composition of the phases at each endof the tie-line passing through P can be derived. Tie-trianglesrepresentingthree-phaseequilibriacommonlyappear in horizontal (isothermal) sections through theprism.TheexampleinFigure 3.27bshowsequilibriumbetween ˛,ˇand/CRphases for an alloy of average

composition Q. Each side of the tie-triangle is a
tie-line. Applying the centre-of-gravity principle, theweight proportion of any phase in the mixture canbe obtained by drawing a line and measuring two
lengths (e.g. % ˛DQR/R˛ ð100). Congruently-
melting phases can be linked together by a join-line, thus simplifying interpretation. For example,component B may be linked to the intermediate
phase A
2C. Any line originating at a pure component
also provides a constant ratio between the other twocomponents along its length.
Tie-lines can be drawn across two-phase regions of
isothermal sections but, unlike equivalent tie-lines in
binary systems, they do not necessarily point directlytowardspurecomponents:theirexactdispositionhastobe determined by practical experiment. It follows that
whenverticalsections(isopleths)aretakenthroughthe
prism, insertion of tie-lines across a two-phase ﬁeld isnot always possible because they may be inclined tothe vertical plane. For related reasons, one ﬁnds that
three-phase regions in vertical sections have slightly
curved sides.
3.2.9.2 Complete solid miscibility
In the ternary diagram of Figure 3.27a the volumeof continuous solid solubility ⊿˛/triangleleftis separated from
the liquid phase by a two-phase ⊿˛CLiquid /triangleleftzone of
convex-lens shape. Analysis of this diagram provides
an insight into the compositional changes attendingthe freezing/melting of a ternary solid solution. It isconvenient to fold down the binary ‘walls’ so thatconstruction lines for isothermal and vertical sections
can be prepared (Figure 3.28a). A vertical section,
which provides guidance on the freezing and melting
of all alloyscontainingthe same amount of component
C, is shown in Figure 3.28b.
Assuming that an alloy of average composition
Xfreezes over a temperature range of T
1toT4,
Figure 3.28c shows an isothermal section for a
temperature T2just below the liquidus. The two-phase
ﬁeld in this section is bivariant. As the proportions
and compositions of ˛and liquid Lgradually change,
the tie-lines for the four temperatures change their
orientation. This rotational effect, which is shown
by projecting the tie-lines downward onto the basal
triangle (Figure 3.29), occurs because the composition
of the residual liquid Lmoves in the general
direction of C, the component of lowest melting point,
and the composition of ˛approaches the average
composition X.
3.2.9.3 Three-phase equilibria
In a ternary system, a eutectic reaction such as
Liquid /arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf˛Cˇis univariant ⊿FD1/triangleleftand, unlike its
binary equivalent, takes place over a range of tempera-
ture. Its characteristics can be demonstrated by consid-
ering the system shown in Figure 3.30a in which two
binary eutectic reactions occur at different tempera-
tures.Thekeyfeatureofthediagram, athree-phasetri-

hence the leading vertex of the triangle represents the
composition of the liquid phase.
A vertical section between component A and the
mid-point of the B–C ‘wall’ (Figure 3.30b) andan isothermal section taken when the tie-triangleis about halfway through its downward movement
(Figure 3.30c) help to explain typical solidiﬁcation
sequences. The vertical section shows that when analloy of composition Xfreezes, primary ˇformation
is followed by eutectic reaction over a range of
temperature. The ﬁnal microstructure consists of

cuts X. As X is traversed by tie-triangles, the relative
amounts of the three phases can be derived for eachisotherm. For alloy Y, lying on the valley line of the

eutectic reaction, it can be seen from both sections
that no primary ˇforms and freezing only produces a
mixture of ˛andˇphases.
These ideas can also be applied to three-phase peri-
tectic reactions in ternary systems, i.e. ˛CLiquid /arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf
ˇ. Being the converse form of the eutectic reaction, its
tie-triangle has the ⊿LC˛/trianglelefttie-line as the leading side
and a trailing vertex. The ‘inﬂated’ triangle in verticalsections is inverted.
3.2.9.4 Four-phase equilibria
The simplest form of four-phase equilibrium, referredto as Class I, is summarized by the ternary eutecticreaction, Liquid /arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf˛CˇC/CR. This invariant condi-
tion⊿FD0/triangleleftis represented by the triangular plateau
at the heart of Figure 3.31. The plateau itself is solidand can be regarded as a stack of three-phase triangles,i.e.˛CˇC/CR. Each of the three constituent binary
systems is eutectiferous with limited solid solubility.It is necessary to visualize that, on cooling, each ofthe three eutectic horizontals becomes the independentsourceofasetofdescendingthree-phaseeutectictrian-gles which behave in the general manner described intheprevioussection.Attheternaryeutecticleveloftheplateau, temperature T
6, these three triangles coalesce
and the ternary reaction follows. (The lines where tri-angles meet are needed when sections are drawn.) Thestackoftie-trianglesassociatedwitheachbinaryeutec-tic reaction deﬁnes a beak-shaped volume, the upper
edge being a ‘valley’ line. Figure 3.31 shows three
valley lines descending to the ternary eutectic point.
A typical sequence of isothermal sections is shown
in Figure 3.32 over the temperature range T
1–T6.A s
the temperature falls, the three eutectic tie-trianglesappear in succession. The liquid ﬁeld shrinks until, at

larger triangle of four-phase equilibrium. Below this
level, after ternary eutectic reaction, the three solidphases adjust their composition in accordance withtheir respective solvus lines. A vertical section whichincludes all alloys containing about 30% component
C is shown in Figure 3.33. The three-phase plateau is
immediatelyapparent.Thissectionalsointersectsthreeof the binary eutectic reaction ‘beaks’, i.e. Liquid C
˛Cˇ, Liquid C˛C/CRand Liquid CˇC/CR.
We will consider the solidiﬁcation of four alloys
which are superimposed on the T
6isothermal section
of Figure 3.32. The simplest case of solidiﬁcation isthe liquid ternary alloy W, which transforms to threephases immediately below the plateau temperature T
6.
This type of alloy is the basis of fusible alloys which
are used for special low m.p. applications (e.g. plugs
for ﬁre-extinguishing sprinkler systems). For example,a certain combination of lead (m.p. 327
°C), tin (m.p.
232°C) and bismuth (m.p. 269 °C) melts at a temper-
ature of 93 °C. On cooling, liquid alloy X will ﬁrst
decompose over a range of temperature to form aeutectic mixture ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftand then change in composi-
tionalong a ‘valley’ line untilitsresidue is ﬁnally con-sumed in the ternary eutectic reaction. Liquid alloy Y
will ﬁrst deposit primary ˇand then, with rotation of
⊿ˇCLiquid /trianglelefttie-lines, become depleted in B until it
reaches the nearby ‘valley’ line. Thereafter, it behaveslike alloy X. In the special case of alloy Z, which lieson a construction line joining the ternary eutectic point
toacorneroftheternaryplateau,itwillﬁrstformapri-
mary phase ⊿/CR/triangleleftand then undergo the ternary reaction:
there will be no preliminary binary eutectic reaction.
We will now outline the nature of two other four-
phase equilibria. Figure 3.34a illustrates the Class II
reaction, Liquid C˛/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalfˇC/CR. As the temperature is
lowered, two sets of descending tie-triangles repre-senting a peritectic-type reaction and a eutectic-typereaction, respectively, combine at the ternary reactionisotherm to form a kite-shaped plane. This plane then
divides,as shownschematicallyin Figure 3.35a, form-
ingasolidthree-phaseplateauandinitiatingadescend-ingsetofeutectictriangles.UnlikeClass Iequilibrium,the composition which reacts with ˛-phase lies outside
the limits of the top of the plateau.
From Figure 3.34b, which illustrates Class III
equilibrium, Liquid C˛Cˇ/arrowrighttophalf/arrowleftbothalf/CR, a solid three-phase
plateau is again a central feature. At the highertemperatures, a eutectic-type reaction ⊿Liquid!˛C
ˇ/triangleleftgenerates a stack of tie-triangles. At the critical
temperature of the ternary peritectic reaction, a large
triangle breaks up and two sets of peritectic-typetriangles are initiated (Figure 3.35b). If the Class IIand Class III ternary reaction sequences are comparedwith that of Class I, it will be seen that there
is an inverse relation between eutectic Class I and
the peritectic Class III. Class II is intermediate incharacter to Classes I and III.

join-lines divide the projection into tie-triangles

In the complementary Figure 3.37, compositional
zones for four classes of dielectric ceramic have been

steatites, steatite porcelains and cordierite ceramics.
These ﬁred ceramics originate from readily-workableclay/talc mixtures. The nominal formula for talc is

(MS) plus silica: accordingly, the zones are located
toward the silica-rich corner of the diagram. Each ﬁred
product consists of small crystals in a glassy matrix
(20–30%). The amount of glass must be closely con-
trolled. Ideally, control of ﬁring is facilitated when theamount of glass-forming liquid phase changes slowly
with changing temperature. In this respect, the pres-
ence of a steeply sloping liquidus is favourable (e.g.
forsterite ⊿Mg

other three materials tend to liquefy rather abruptlyand to form too much liquid, making ﬁring a poten-
tially difﬁcult operation.

3.3 Principles of alloy theory
3.3.1 Primary substitutional solid solutions
3.3.1.1 The Hume-Rothery rules
The key phase diagrams outlined in Section 3.2.8
exhibit many common features (e.g. primary solid
solutions, intermediate phases) and for systems based
on simple metals some general rules1governing the
formation of alloys have been formulated. Theserules can form a useful basis for predicting alloyingbehaviour in other more complex systems.
In brief the rules for primary solid solubility are as
follows:
1.Atomic size factor — If the atomic diameter of the
solute atom differs by more than 15% from thatof the solvent atom, the extent of the primarysolid solution is small. In such cases it is said thatthe size-factor is unfavourable for extensive solid
solution.
1These are usually called the Hume-Rothery rules because it
was chieﬂy W. Hume-Rothery and his colleagues who
formulated them.2.Electrochemical effect — The more electropositive
the one component and the more electronegative
the other, the greater is the tendency for the twoelements to form compounds rather than extensivesolid solutions.
3.Relativevalencyeffect — Ametalofhighervalency
is more likely to dissolve to a large extent in oneof lower valency than vice versa.
3.3.1.2 Size-factor effect
Twometalsareabletoformacontinuousrangeofsolidsolutions only if they have the same crystal structure(e.g. copper and nickel). However, even when thecrystal structure of the two elements is the same, the
extent of the primary solubility is limited if the atomic
size of the two metals, usually taken as the closestdistance of approach of atoms in the crystal of thepure metal, is unfavourable. This is demonstrated in
Figure 3.38 for alloy systemswhere rules 2 and 3 have
been observed, i.e. the electrochemical properties ofthe twoelements are similar and thesoluteisdissolvedin a metal of lower valency. As the size difference
between the atoms of the two component metals A and
B approaches 15%, the equilibrium diagram changesfromthatofthecopper–nickeltypetooneofaeutecticsystem with limited primary solid solubility.
The size-factor effect is due to the distortion
produced in the parent lattice around the dissolvedmisﬁtting solute atom. In these localized regions the
Figure 3.38 Effect of size factor on the form of the equilibrium diagram; examples include (a) Cu–Ni, Au–Pt, (b) Ni–Pt,
(c)Au–Ni,and(d)Cu–Ag .
74Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
interatomic distance will differ from that given by the
minimum in the E–rcurve of Figure 6.2, so that the
internal energy and hence the free energy, G,o ft h e
system is raised. In the limit when the lattice distortion
is greater than some critical value the primary solidsolution becomes thermodynamically unstable relative
to some other phase.
3.3.1.3 Electrochemical effect
This effect is best demonstrated by reference to the
alloying behaviour of an electropositive solvent with
solutes of increasing electronegativity.The electroneg-
ativityofelementsinthePeriodicTableincreasesfrom
lefttorightinanyperiodandfrombottomtotopinany
group. Thus, if magnesium is alloyed with elementsof Group IV the compounds formed, Mg
2(Si, Sn or
Pb), become more stable in the order lead, tin, silicon,
as shown by their melting points, 550 °C, 778°Ca n d
1085°C, respectively. In accordance with rule 2 the
extent of the primary solid solution is small ( ³7.75
at.%, 3.35 at.%, and negligible, respectively, at the
eutectic temperature) and also decreases in the order
lead, tin, silicon. Similar effects are also observed with
elementsof Group V, whichincludestheelements bis-
muth,antimonyandarsenic,whenthecompoundsMg3
⊿Bi, Sb or As /triangleleft2are formed.
The importance of compound formation in control-
ling the extent of the primary solid solution can be
appreciated by reference to Figure 3.39, where the
curves represent the free-energy versus compositionrelationship between the ˛-phase and compound at
a temperature T. It is clear from Figure 3.39a that
at this temperature the ˛-phase is stable up to a
composition c
1, above which the phase mixture ( ˛C
compound) has the lower free energy. When the com-poundbecomes more stable,as showninFigure 3.39b,
the solid solubility decreases, and correspondingly the
phasemixtureisnowstableovera greater compositionrange which extends from c
3toc4.The above example is an illustration of a more gen-
eral principle that the solubility of a phase decreaseswithincreasingstability,andmay alsobeusedtoshow
that the concentration of solute in solution increases
as the radius of curvature of the precipitate particle
decreases. Small precipitate particles are less stable
than large particles and the variation of solubility with
particle size is recognized in classical thermodynamics
by the Thomson–Freundlich equation
ln[c⊿r/triangleleft/c]D2/CR/DEL/kTr (3.7)
where c⊿r/triangleleftis theconcentrationof solutein equilibrium
with small particles of radius r, cthe equilibrium con-
centration, /CRthe precipitate/matrix interfacial energy
and/DELthe atomic volume (see Chapter 8).
3.3.1.4 Relative valency effect
Thisisageneralruleforalloysoftheunivalentmetals,
copper, silver and gold, with those of higher valency.Thus, for example, copper will dissolve approximately
40% zinc in solid solution but the solution of copper
in zinc is limited. For solvent elements of higher
valencies the application is not so general, and in fact
exceptions, such as that exhibited by the magnesium-
indium system, occur.
3.3.1.5 The primary solid solubility boundary
It is not yet possible to predict the exact form of the
˛-solid solubility boundary, but in general terms the
boundary may be such that the range of primary solid
solution either (1) increases or (2) decreases with rise
in temperature. Both forms arise as a result of the
increase in entropy which occurs when solute atomsare added to a solvent. It will be remembered that this
entropy of mixing is a measure of the extra disorder
of the solution compared with the pure metal.
The most common form of phase boundary is
that indicating that the solution of one metal in
anotherincreaseswithriseintemperature.Thisfollows

Structural phases: their formation and transitions 75
from thermodynamic reasoning since increasing the
temperature favours the structure of highest entropy
(becauseofthe /NULTStermintherelation GDH/NULTS)
and in alloy systems of the simple eutectic type an˛-solid solution has a higher entropy than a phase
mixture ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleft. Thus, if the alloy exists as a phase
mixture ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftat the lower temperatures, it does
so because the value of Hhappens to be less for
the mixture than for the homogeneous solution atthat composition. However, because of its greaterentropyterm, thesolutiongraduallybecomes preferredat high temperatures. In more complex alloy systems,particularly those containing intermediate phases ofthe secondary solid solution type (e.g. copper –zinc,
copper–gallium, copper –aluminium, etc.), the range
of primary solid solution decreases with rise in
temperature. This is because the ˇ-phase, like the ˛-
phase, is a disordered solid solution. However, since itoccurs at a higher composition, it has a higher entropyof mixing, and consequently its free energy will fallmore rapidly with rise in temperature. This is shownschematically in Figure 3.40. The point of contact onthe free energy curve of the ˛-phase, determined by
drawing the common tangent to the ˛andˇcurves,
governs the solubility cat a given temperature T.T h e

Many alloys of copper or silver reach the limit of
solubility at an electron to atom ratio of about 1.4.The divalent elements zinc, cadmium and mercuryhave solubilities of approximately 40 at.%
1(e.g.
copper–zinc, silver –cadmium, silver –mercury), the
trivalent elements approximately 20 at.% (e.g. cop-
per–aluminium, copper –gallium, silver –aluminium,
silver–indium) and the tetravalent elements about
13 at.% (e.g. copper –germanium, copper –silicon, sil-
ver–tin), respectively.
The limit of solubility has been explained by Jones
intermsoftheBrillouinzonestructure(seeChapter 6).
It is assumed that the density of states –energy curve
for the two phases, ˛(the close-packed phase) and
ˇ(the more open phase), is of the form shown in
Figure 3.41, where the N⊿E/triangleleftcurve deviates from the
parabolic relationship as the Fermi surface approaches
the zone boundary.2As the solute is added to the
solvent lattice and more electrons are added the top
of the Fermi level moves towards A, i.e. where the

2The shape of the Fermi surface may be determined from
measurements of physical properties as a function oforientation in a single crystal. The surface resistance to ahigh-frequency current at low temperatures (the anomalousskin effect) shows that in copper the Fermi surface isdistorted from the spherical shape but becomes more nearlyspherical in copper alloys.

density of states is high and the total energy Efor a
given electron concentration is low. Above this point
the number of available energy levels decreases somarkedly that the introduction of a few more electrons
per atom causes a sharp increase in energy. Thus,
just above this critical point the ˛structure becomes
unstable relative to the alternative ˇstructure which
canaccommodatetheelectronswithinasmallerenergyrange, i.e. the energy of the Fermi level is lower if
theˇ-phase curve is followed rather than the ˛-phase
curve. The composition for which E
maxreaches the
point EAis therefore a critical one, since the alloy will
adopt that phase which has the lowest energy. It canbe shown that this point corresponds to an electron-to-
atom ratio of approximately 1.4.
3.3.2 Interstitial solid solutions
Interstitial solid solutions are formed when the solute
atomscanﬁtintotheintersticesofthelatticeofthesol-
vent. However, an examination of the common crystal
latticesshowsthatthesizeoftheavailableintersticesis
restricted,andconsequentlyonlythesmallatoms,such
as hydrogen, boron, carbon or nitrogen, with atomicradii very much less than one nanometre form such
solutions. The most common examples occur in the
transition elements and in particular the solution ofcarbon or nitrogen in iron is of great practical impor-
tance. In fcc iron (austenite) the largest interstice or
‘hole’ is at the centre of the unit cell (coordinates

carbon atom (80 pm (0.8 ˚A) diameter) or a nitrogen
atom (70 pm diameter) therefore expands the latticeon solution, but nevertheless dissolves in quantities
up to 1.7 wt% and 2.8 wt%, respectively. Although
the bcc lattice is the more open structure the largest
interstice is smaller than that in the fcc. In bcc iron
(ferrite) the largest hole is at the position (

situated symmetrically around it; this can accommo-
date an atom of radius 36 pm, i.e. 0 .29r, as shown
in Figure 3.42a. However, internal friction and X-ray
diffraction experiments show that the carbon or nitro-
gen atoms do not use this site, but instead occupya smaller site which can accommodate an atom only
0.154r, or 19 pm. This position (0, 0,

2) at the mid-
points of the cell edges is known as the octahedral site
since, as can be seen from Figure 3.42b, it has a dis-torted octahedral symmetry for which two of the ironatoms are nearer to the centre of the site than the other
four nearest neighbours. The reason for the interstitial
atoms preferring this small site is thought to be due tothe elastic properties of the bcc lattice. The two ironatoms which lie above and below the interstice, and
which are responsible for the smallness of the hole,
can be pushed away more easily than the four atomsaround the larger interstice. As a result, the solutionof carbon in ˛-iron is extremely limited (0.02 wt%)
andthestructurebecomesdistortedintoabody-centred
tetragonal lattice. The caxis for each interstitial site
is, however, disordered, so that this gives rise to astructure which is statistically cubic. The body-centred
tetragonal structure forms the basis of martensite (an
extremely hard metastable constituent of steel), sincethe quenching treatment given to steel retains the car-bon in supersaturated solution (see Chapter 8).
3.3.3 Types of intermediate phases
3.3.3.1 Electrochemical compounds
The phases which form in the intermediate compo-
sition regions of the equilibrium diagram may be
(1) electrochemical or full-zone compounds, (2) size-
factor compounds, or (3) electron compounds. Theterm ‘compound’ still persists even though many ofthesephasesdonotobeythevalencylawsofchemistry
and often exist over a wide composition range.
We have already seen that a strong tendency
for compound formation exists when one element
Structural phases: their formation and transitions 77
is electropositive and the other is electronegative.
The magnesium-based compounds are probablythe most common examples having the formulaMg
2(Pb, Sn, Ge or Si). These have many features
in common with salt-like compounds since their
compositions satisfy the chemical valency laws, their
range of solubility is small, and usually they havehigh melting points. Moreover, many of these types ofcompounds have crystal structures identical to deﬁnite
chemical compounds such as sodium chloride, NaCl,
or calcium ﬂuoride, CaF
2. In this respect the Mg2X
series are anti-isomorphous with the CaF 2ﬂuorspar
structure, i.e. the magnesium metal atoms are in theposition of the non-metallic ﬂuoride atoms and the
metalloid atoms such as tin or silicon take up the
position of the metal atoms in calcium ﬂuoride.
Eventhoughthese compoundsobeyall the chemical
principles they may often be considered as specialelectron compounds. For example, the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone
1of the CaF 2structure is completely ﬁlled at
8
3electrons per atom, which signiﬁcantly is exactly
that supplied by the compound Mg2Pb,Sn,...,e t c .
Justiﬁcation for calling these full-zone compounds is
alsoprovidedbyelectrical conductivitymeasurements.
In contrast to the behaviour of salt-like compoundswhichexhibitlowconductivityeven inthe liquidstate,the compound Mg
2Pb shows the normal conduction
(which indicates the possibility of zone overlapping)
while Mg2Sn behaves like a semiconductor (indicating
that a small energy gap exists between the ﬁrst andsecond Brillouin zones).
In general, it is probable that both concepts are nec-
essary to describe the complete situation. As we shall
see in Section 3.3.3.3, with increasing electrochemical
factor even true electron compounds begin to showsome of the properties associated with chemical com-pounds, and the atoms in the structure take up ordered
arrangements.
3.3.3.2 Size-factor compounds
When the atomic diameters of the two elements dif-
fer only slightly, electron compounds are formed, asdiscussed in the next section. However, when the dif-ferenceinatomicdiameterisappreciable,deﬁnitesize-
factor compounds are formed which may be of the
(1) interstitial or (2) substitutional type.
A consideration of several interstitial solid solutions
has shown that if the interstitial atom has an atomic
radius 0.41 times that of the metal atom then it can ﬁt
into the largest available structural interstice withoutdistortion. When the ratio of the radius of the intersti-tial atom to that of the metal atom is greater than 0.41but less than 0.59, interstitial compounds are formed;
hydrides, borides, carbides and nitrides of the transi-
tion metals are common examples. These compoundsusually take up a simple structure of either the cubic
1Brillouin zones and electrical conductivity are dealt with in
Chapter 6.or hexagonal type, with the metal atoms occupying
the normal lattice sites and the non-metal atoms the
interstices. In general, the phases occur over a range
of composition which is often centred about a simple
formula such as M 2X and MX. Common examples are
carbides and nitrides of titanium, zirconium, hafnium,
vanadium, niobium and tantalum, all of which crys-
tallize in the NaCl structure. It is clear, therefore, thatthese phases do not form merely as a result of the
small atom ﬁtting into the interstices of the solvent
structure, since vanadium, niobium and tantalum are
bcc, while titanium, zirconium and hafnium are cph.
By changing their structure to fcc the transition metalsallow the interstitial atom not only a larger ‘hole’ but
also six metallic neighbours. The formation of bonds
in three directions at right angles, such as occurs inthe sodium chloride arrangement, imparts a condition
of great stability to these MX carbides.
When the ratio r
⊿interstitial /trianglelefttor⊿metal /triangleleftexceeds 0.59
the distortion becomes appreciable, and consequently
more complicated crystal structures are formed. Thus,iron nitride, where r
N/rFeD0.56, takes up a structure
in which nitrogen lies at the centre of six atoms as
suggested above, while iron carbide, i.e. cementite,Fe
3C, for which the ratio is 0.63, takes up a more
complex structure.
For intermediate atomic size difference, i.e. about
20–30%, an efﬁcient packing of the atoms can be
achieved if the crystal structure common to the Lavesphases is adopted (Table 3.2). These phases, classiﬁed
by Laves and his co-workers, have the formula AB
2
and each A atom has 12 B neighbours and 4 A neigh-
bours, while each B atom is surrounded by six like
and six unlike atoms. The average coordination num-
ber of the structure (13.33) is higher, therefore, than
that achieved by the packing of atoms of equal size.
These phases crystallize in one of three closely relatedstructures which are isomorphous with the compounds
MgCu
2(cubic), MgNi2(hexagonal) or MgZn2(hexag-
onal). The secret of the close relationship betweenthese structures is that the small atoms are arranged
on a space lattice of tetrahedra.
The different ways of joining such tetrahedra
account for the different structures. This may be
demonstrated by an examination of the MgCu
2
structure. The small B atoms lie at the corners oftetrahedra which are joined point-to-point throughout
space, as shown in Figure 3.43a. Such an arrangementprovides large holes of the type shown in Figure 3.43b
and these are best ﬁlled when the atomic ratio
r

of MgCu2is shown in Figure 3.43c. The MgZn2
structure is hexagonal, and in this case the tetrahedra
are joined alternately point-to-point and base-to-base
in long chains to form a wurtzite type of structure.
The MgNi2structure is also hexagonal and although
very complex it is essentially a mixture of both theMgCu
2and MgNi2types.

This limited range of homogeneity is not due to any

ionic nature of the compound, since ionic compounds
usuallyhavelowcoordinationnumberswhereas.Lavesphases have high coordination numbers, but becauseof the stringent geometrical conditions governing thestructure. However, even though the chief reason fortheir existence is that the ratio of the radius of thelarge atom to that of the small is about 1.2, there areindicationsthat electronicfactors may playsome smallpart. For example, provided the initial size-factor con-dition is satisﬁed then if the e/aratio is high (e.g.
2), there is a tendency for compounds to crystallizein the MgZn
2structure, while if the e/aratio is low
(e.g.4
3), then there is a tendency for the MgCu2type
of structure to be formed. This electronic feature is
demonstrated in the magnesium–nickel–zinc ternary
system. Thus, even though the binary systems containboth the MgZn
2and MgNi2phases the ternary com-
pound MgNiZn has the MgCu2structure, presumably
because its e/aratio is4
3. Table 3.2 shows a few com-
mon examples of each type of Laves structure, from
which it is evident that there is also a general tendencyfor transition metals to be involved.
3.3.3.3 Electron compounds
Alloys of copper, silver and gold with the B subgroupall possess the sequence ˛,ˇ,/CR,2of structurally
similar phases, and while each phase does not occur atthe same composition when this is measured in weightper cent or atomic per cent, they do so if compositionis expressed in terms of electron concentration. Hume-
Rothery and his co-workers have pointed out that
thee/aratio is important not only in governing the
limit of the ˛-solid solution but also in controlling
the formation of certain intermediate phases; for thisreason they have been termed ‘electron compounds’.
In terms of those phases observed in the cop-
per–zinc system (Figure 3.20), ˇ-phases are found at
ane/aratio of
3
2and these phases are often either
disordered bcc in structure or ordered CsCl-type, ˇ0.
In the copper–aluminium system for example, the ˇ-
structure is found at Cu 3Al, where the three valency
electrons from the aluminium and the one from eachcopper atom make up a ratio of 6 electrons to 4 atoms,
i.e.e/aD
3
2. Similarly, in the copper–tin system the
ˇ-phase occurs at Cu 5Sn with 9 electrons to 6 atoms
giving the governing e/aratio. The /CR-brass phase,
Cu5Zn8, has a complex cubic (52 atoms per unit cell)
structure, and is characterized by an e/aratio of21

whilethe ε-brassphase,CuZn 3,hasacphstructureand

4.Alistofsomeofthese
structurally-analogous phases is given in Table 3.3.
A close examination of this table shows that some
of these phases, e.g. Cu 5Si and Ag3Al, exist in dif-
ferent structural forms for the same e/aratio. Thus,
Ag3Al is basically a3
2bcc phase, but it only exists
as such at high temperatures; at intermediate temper-
atures it is cph and at low temperatures ˇ-Mn. It is
also noticeable that to conform with the appropriate

electron-to-atom ratio the transition metals are cred-
itedwithzero valency. The basisfor thismay be found
in their electronic structure which is characterized byan incomplete d-band below an occupied outermost s-
band. The nickel atom, for example, has an electronic
structure denoted by (2) (8) (16) (2), i.e. two elec-trons in the ﬁrst quantum shell, eight in the second,
sixteen in the third and two in the fourth shells, and
while this indicates that the free atom has two valencyelectrons, it also shows two electrons missing from the
thirdquantumshell.Thus,ifnickelcontributesvalency
electrons, it also absorbs an equal number from otheratoms to ﬁll up the third quantum shell so that the net
effect is zero.
Without doubt the electron concentration is the
most important single factor which governs these
compounds. However, as for the other intermediate
phases, a closer examination shows an interplay of all
factors.Thus,ingeneral,thebcc
3

formed ifthesizefactorislessthan š18%,anincrease
in the valency of the solute tends to favour cph and
ˇ-Mn structures at the expense of the bcc structure, a
high electrochemical factor leads to ordering up to the
melting point, and an increase in temperature favours
the bcc structure in preference to the cph or ˇ-Mn
structure.
3.3.4 Order–disorder phenomena
A substitutional solid solution can be one of twotypes, either ordered in which the A and B atomsare arranged in a regular pattern, or disordered in
whichthedistributionoftheAandB atomsisrandom.
From the previous section it is clear that the necessarycondition for the formation of a superlattice, i.e. an
ordered solid solution, is that dissimilar atoms must
attract each other more than similar atoms. In addition,thealloymustexistat ornear acompositionwhichcan
be expressed by a simple formula such as AB, A
3Bo r
AB3. The following are common structures:
1.CuZnWhile the disordered solution is bcc with
equal probabilities of having copper or zinc atomsat each lattice point, the ordered lattice has copperatoms and zinc atoms segregated to cube corners
(0, 0, 0) and centres (
1
2,1
2,1
2), respectively. The
superlattice in the ˇ-phase therefore takes up the
CsCl (also described as B2 or L2 0) structure as
illustrated in Figure 3.44a. Other examples of thesame type, which may be considered as being made
up of two interpenetrating simple cubic lattices, are
Ag(Mg, Zn or Cd), AuNi, NiAl, FeAl and FeCo.
2.Cu
3AuThis structure, which occurs less frequently
than the ˇ-brass type, is based on the fcc structure
with copper atoms at the centres of the faces (0,1

2) and gold atoms at the corners (0, 0, 0), as shown
inFigure 3.44b.OtherexamplesoftheL1 2structure
include Ni 3Al, Ni 3Ti, Ni3Si, Pt3Al, Fe 3Ge, Zr 3Al.
3.AuCuThe AuCu structure shown in Figure 3.44c is
alsobasedonthefcclattice,butinthiscasealternate⊿001/triangleleftlayers are made up ofcopper and goldatoms,
respectively. Hence, because the atomic sizes of
copper and gold differ, the lattice is distorted intoa tetragonal structure having an axial ratio c/aD
0.93. Other examples of the L1
0include CoPt, FePt
and TiAl.
4.Fe3AlLike FeAl, the Fe 3Al structure is based on
the bcc lattice but, as shown in Figure 3.44d, eight

simple cells are necessary to describe the complete
orderedarrangement. Inthisstructureanyindividualatom is surrounded by the maximum number ofunlike atoms and the aluminium atoms are arrangedtetrahedrally in the cell. Other examples of the D0

include Fe 3Si and Cu 3Al.
5.Mg3CdThis ordered structure is based on the cph
lattice. Other examples of the D0 19structure are
Ti3Al, MgCd3and Ni 3Sn.
Another important structure which occurs in certain
intermetallics is the defect lattice. In the compoundNiAl, as the composition deviates from stoichiome-try towards pure aluminium, the electron to atom ratio
becomes greater than

tion of vacancies to maintain the number of electronsperunitcellataconstantvalueof3.Suchdefectsobvi-ouslyincrease theentropyof the alloy,butthe fact thatthese phases are stable at low temperatures, where theentropy factor is unimportant, demonstrates that their
stability is due to a lowering of internal energy. Such
defects produce an anomalous decrease in both the lat-tice parameter and the density above 50 at.% Al.
3.4 The mechanism of phase changes
3.4.1 Kinetic considerations
Changes of phase in the solid state involve a redistri-bution of the atoms in that solid and the kinetics ofthe change necessarily depend upon the rate of atomicmigration. The transport of atoms through the crystal
is more generally termed diffusion, and is dealt with
in Section 6.4. This can occur more easily with theaid of vacancies, since the basic act of diffusion is themovement of an atom to an empty adjacent atomicsite.
Let us consider that during a phase change an
atom is moved from an ˛-phase lattice site to a more
favourable ˇ-phase lattice site. The energy of the atom
should vary with distance as shown in Figure 3.45,where the potential barrier which has to be overcome
arises from the interatomic forces between the mov-
ing atom and the group of atoms which adjoin it andthe new site. Only those atoms ( n) with an energy

tionvelocityismeasured at different temperatures and,since
ln (Rate) DlnA/NULQ/kT (3.9)
the slope of the In (rate) versus 1 /Tcurve gives Q/k.
In deriving equation (3.8), usually called an
Arrhenius equation after the Swedish chemist who
ﬁrst studied reaction kinetics, no account is taken ofthe entropy of activation, i.e. the change in entropy
as a result of the transition. In considering a general
reaction the probability expression should be written
in terms of the free energy of activation per atom F
orGrather than just the internal energy or enthalpy.
The rate equation then becomes
RateDAexp[/NULF/kT]
DAexp[S/k]exp[/NULE/kT] ⊿3.10/triangleleft
The slope of the ln (rate) versus 1 /Tcurve then gives
the temperature-dependence of the reaction rate, which
is governed by the activation energy or enthalpy, and
the magnitude of the intercept on the ln (rate) axis
depends on the temperature-independent terms and
include the frequency factor and the entropy term.
During the transformation it is not necessary for
the entire system to go from ˛toˇat one jump
and, in fact, if this were necessary, phase changes
would practically never occur. Instead, most phase
changes occur by a process of nucleation and growth
(cf. solidiﬁcation, Section 3.1.1). Chance thermal ﬂuc-
tuations provide a small number of atoms with sufﬁ-cient activation energy to break away from the matrix
(the old structure) and form a small nucleus of the
new phase, which then grows at the expense of the
matrix until the whole structure is transformed. By this
mechanism, the amount of material in the intermedi-ate conﬁguration of higher free energy is kept to a
minimum, as it is localized into atomically thin lay-
ers at the interface between the phases. Because of
1Q may also be given as the energy in J mol/NUL1in which
case the rate equation becomes
Rate of reaction DAexp[/NULQ/RT]
whereRDkNis the gas constant, i.e. 8.314 J mol/NUL1K/NUL1.
Structural phases: their formation and transitions 81
this mechanism of transformation, the factors which
determine the rate of phase change are: (1) the rate
of nucleation, N(i.e. the number of nuclei formed in
unit volume in unit time) and (2) the rate of growth,G(i.e. the rate of increase in radius with time). Both
processes require activation energies, which in general
are not equal, but the values are much smaller thanthat needed to change the whole structure from ˛toˇ
in one operation.
Even with such an economical process as nucleation
and growth transformation, difﬁculties occur and it iscommon to ﬁnd that the transformation temperature,evenunder thebestexperimental conditions,isslightlyhigher on heating than on cooling. This sluggishness
of the transformation is known as hysteresis, and is
attributed to the difﬁculties of nucleation, since dif-fusion, which controls the growth process, is usuallyhigh at temperatures near the transformation tempera-
ture and is, therefore, not rate-controlling. Perhaps the
simplest phase change to indicate this is the solidiﬁca-tion of a liquid metal.
The transformation temperature, as shown on the
equilibrium diagram, represents the point at which the
free energy of the solid phase is equal to that of theliquid phase. Thus, we may consider the transition, asgiven in a phase diagram, to occur when the bulk or
chemical free energy change, G
v, is inﬁnitesimally
small and negative, i.e. when a small but positive driv-ingforce exists.However, sucha deﬁnitionignorestheprocess whereby the bulk liquid is transformed to bulksolid, i.e. nucleation and growth. When the nucleus is

from the surface energy of solid–liquidinterface. Nor-mally, for the bulk phase change, the number of atomswhich form the interface is small and G

withG vcan be ignored. However, during nucleation
G vis small, since it is proportional to the amounttransformed, and G s, the extra free energy of the
boundary atoms, becomes important due to the large
surface area to volume ratio of small nuclei. Thereforebefore transformation can take place the negative termG

since G vis zero at the equilibrium freezing point, it
follows that undercooling must result.
3.4.2 Homogeneous nucleation
Quantitatively, since G vdepends on the volume of

we can write for a spherical nucleus of radius r

where G vis the bulk free energy change involved
in the formation of the nucleus of unit volume and/CRis the surface energy of unit area. When the
nuclei are small the positive surface energy termpredominates, while when they are large the negativevolume term predominates, so that the change in free
energy as a function of nucleus size is as shown in
Figure 3.46a. This indicates that a critical nucleus sizeexists below which the free energy increases as thenucleus grows, and above which further growth canproceed with a lowering of free energy; G

The surface energy factor /CRis not strongly dependent
on temperature, but the greater the degree of under-cooling or supersaturation, the greater is the releaseof chemical free energy and the smaller the criticalnucleus size and energy of nucleation. This can beshown analytically since G

The term exp [ /NULQ/kT] is introduced to allow for
the fact that rate of nucleus formation is in the limit
controlled by the rate of atomic migration. Clearly,with very extensive degrees of undercooling, whenG
max−Q, the rate of nucleation approaches exp
[/NULQ/kT] and, because of the slowness of atomic
mobility, this becomes small at low temperature(Figure 3.46b). While this range of conditions can
be reached for liquid glasses the nucleation of liquid
metals normally occurs at temperatures before thiscondition is reached. (By splat cooling, small droplets
of the metal are cooled very rapidly ⊿10

an amorphous solid may be produced.) Nevertheless,the principles are of importance in metallurgy sincein the isothermal transformation of eutectoid steel, for
example, the rate of transformation initially increases
and thendecreases withloweringof the transformationtemperature ( seeTTTcurves, Chapter 8).
3.4.3 Heterogeneous nucleation
In practice, homogeneous nucleation rarely takes place
and heterogeneous nucleation occurs either on the
mould walls or on insoluble impurity particles. Fromequation (3.13) it is evident that a reduction in theinterfacialenergy /CRwouldfacilitatenucleationatsmall

3.4.4 Nucleation in solids
When the transformation takes place in the solid state,
i.e. between two solid phases, a second factor givingrise to hysteresis operates. The new phase usually
has a different parameter and crystal structure from
the old so that the transformation is accompanied by
dimensional changes. However, the changes in volume

of the interface. A coherent interface is formed when
the two crystals have a good ‘match’ and the two lat-
tices are continuous across the interface. This happens
when the interfacial plane has the same atomic conﬁg-
uration in both phases, e.g. f111gin fcc and f0001g
in cph. When the ‘match’ at the interface is not perfect
it is still possible to maintain coherency by strain-
ing one or both lattices, as shown in Figure 3.48a.
These coherency strains increase the energy and for
large misﬁts it becomes energetically more favourable
to form a semi-coherent interface in which the mis-
match is periodically taken up by misﬁt dislocations.1
The coherency strains can then be relieved by a cross-grid of dislocations in the interface plane, the spac-
ing of which depends on the Burgers vector bof the
dislocation and the misﬁt ε,i . e . b/ε. The interfacial
energy for semi-coherent interfaces arises from the
change in composition across the interface or chemical
contribution as for fully-coherent interfaces, plus the
energy of the dislocations (see Chapter 4). The energy
of a semi-coherent interface is 200–500 mJ/m2and
increases with decreasing dislocation spacing until the
dislocation strain ﬁelds overlap. When this occurs, the
discrete nature of the dislocations is lost and the inter-
face becomes incoherent. The incoherent interface is
somewhat similar to a high-angle grain boundary (see
Figure 3.3) with its energy of 0.5 to 1 J/m2relatively
independent of the orientation.
The surface and strain energy effects discussed
above play an important role in phase separation.
When there is coherence in the atomic structure across
the interface between precipitate and matrix the sur-
face energy term is small, and it is the strain energy
factor which controls the shape of the particle. A
plate-shaped particle is associated with the least strain
energy, while a spherical-shaped particle is associated
with maximum strain energy but the minimum surface
energy. On the other hand, surface energy determines
the crystallographic plane of the matrix on which a
1A detailed treatment of dislocations and other defects is
given in Chapter 4.plate-like precipitate forms. Thus, the habit plane is
the one which allows the planes at the interface to ﬁttogether with the minimum of disregistry; the frequent
occurrence of the Widmanst ¨atten structures may be
explained on this basis. It is also observed that precip-
itation occurs most readily in regions of the structure
which are somewhat disarranged, e.g. at grain bound-
aries,inclusions,dislocationsorotherpositionsofhigh
residual stress caused by plastic deformation. Suchregions have an unusually high free energy and neces-
sarily are the ﬁrst areas to become unstable during the
transformation. Also, new phases can form there with
a minimum increase in surface energy. This behaviour
is considered again in Chapter 7.

Defects in solids
4.1 Types of imperfection
Real solidsinvariably containstructuraldiscontinuities
and localized regions of disorder. This heterogene-
ity can exist on both microscopic and macroscopic
scales, with defects or imperfections ranging in sizefrom missing or misplaced atoms to features that are
visible to the naked eye. The majority of materials
used for engineering components and structures are
made up from a large number of small interlocking
grains or crystals. It is therefore immediately appro-
priate to regard the grain boundary surfaces of such
polycrystalline aggregates as a type of imperfection.
Other relatively large defects, such as shrinkage pores,
gas bubbles, inclusions of foreign matter and cracks,may be found dispersed throughout the grains of a
metal or ceramic material. In general, however, these
large-scale defects are very much inﬂuenced by the
processing of the material and are less fundamental to
the basic material. More attention will thus be given
to the atomic-scale defects in materials. Within each
grain, atoms are regularly arranged according to thebasic crystal structure but a variety of imperfections,
classiﬁed generally as crystal defects, may also occur.
A schematic diagram of these basic defects is shown
in Figure 4.1. These take the form of:
žPoint defects, such as vacant atomic sites (or simply
vacancies) and interstitial atoms (or simply intersti-tials) where an atom sits in an interstice rather than
a normal lattice site
žLine defects, such as dislocations
žPlanar defects, such as stacking faults and twin
boundaries
žVolume defects, such as voids, gas bubbles and
cavities.
In the following sections this type of classiﬁcation
will be used to consider the defects which can occur
in metallic and ceramic crystals. Glasses already lacklong-range order; we will therefore concentrate upon

crystal defects. Defects in crystalline macromolecular
structures,as foundinpolymers, form aspecialsubjectand will be dealt with separately in Section 4.6.7.
4.2 Point defects
4.2.1 Point defects in metals
Of the various lattice defects the vacancy is the onlyspecies that is ever present in appreciable concen-
trations in thermodynamic equilibrium and increases
exponentially with rise in temperature, as shown inFigure 4.2. The vacancy is formed by removing anatom from its lattice site and depositing it in a nearbyatomic site where it can be easily accommodated.Favoured places are the free surface of the crystal, a

The value of the entropy term is not accurately
known but it is usually taken to be within a factorof ten of the value 10; for simplicity we will take it tobe unity.
The equilibrium number of vacancies rises rapidly
with increasing temperature, owing to the exponentialform of the expression, and for most common metals
has a value of about 10
/NUL4near the melting point. For
example, kTatroomtemperature(300 K)is ³1/40 eV
and for aluminium EfD0.7 eV, so that at 900 K we

As the temperature is lowered, cshould decrease
in order to maintain equilibrium and to do this thevacancies must migrate to positions in the structurewhere they can be annihilated; these locations are thenknown as ‘vacancy sinks’ and include such places asthe free surface, grain boundaries and dislocations.

Clearly the free surface of a sample or the grain
boundary interface are a considerable distance, in
atomic terms, from the centre of a grain and sodislocations in the body of the grain or crystal are
the most efﬁcient ‘sink’ for vacancies. Vacancies are
annihilated at the edge of the extra half-plane of atoms
of the dislocation, as shown in Figure 4.4a and 4.4b.
This causes the dislocation to climb, as discussed
in Section 4.3.4. The process whereby vacancies
are annihilated at vacancy sinks such as surfaces,
grain boundaries and dislocations, to satisfy the
thermodynamic equilibrium concentration at a giventemperature is, of course, reversible. When a metal
is heated the equilibrium concentration increases and,
to produce this additional concentration, the surfaces,
grain boundaries and dislocationsin the crystal reverse
their role and act as vacancy sources and emit
vacancies; the extra half-plane of atoms climbs in the
opposite sense (see Figures 4.4c and 4.4d).
Belowacertaintemperature,themigrationofvacan-
cies will be too slow for equilibrium to be main-
tained, and at the lower temperatures a concentration
of vacancies in excess of the equilibrium number will
Figure 4.4 Climb of a dislocation, (a) and (b) to annihilate,
(c) and (d) to create a vacancy .be retained in the structure. Moreover, if the cool-
ing rate of the metal or alloy is particularly rapid,
as, for example, in quenching, the vast majority of
the vacancies which exist at high temperatures can be‘frozen-in’.
Vacancies are of considerable importance in gov-
erning the kinetics of many physical processes. Theindustrialprocessesofannealing,homogenization,pre-cipitation, sintering, surface-hardening, as well as oxi-dation and creep, all involve, to varying degrees, thetransport of atoms through the structure with the helpof vacancies. Similarly, vacancies enable dislocationsto climb, since to move the extra half-plane of a dislo-cationupordownrequiresthemasstransportofatoms.This mechanism is extremely important in the recov-ery stage of annealing and also enables dislocations toclimb over obstacles lying in their slip plane; in thisway materials can soften and lose their resistance tocreep at high temperatures.
In metals the energy of formation of an interstitial
atom is much higher than that for a vacancy andis of the order of 4 eV. At temperatures just below
the melting point, the concentration of such point
defects is only about 10
/NUL15and therefore interstitials
are of little consequence in the normal behaviour ofmetals.Theyare,however,moreimportantinceramicsbecause of the more open crystal structure. They arealso of importance in the deformation behaviour ofsolids when point defects are produced by the non-
conservative motion of jogs in screw dislocation (see
Section 4.3.4) and also of particular importance inmaterials that have been subjected to irradiation byhigh-energy particles.
4.2.2 Point defects in non-metallic crystals
Point defects in non-metallic, particularly ionic, struc-tures are associated with additional features (e.g. therequirement to maintain electrical neutrality and thepossibility of both anion-defects and cation-defectsexisting). An anion vacancy in NaCl, for example, willbe a positively-charged defect and may trap an elec-tron to become a neutral F-centre. Alternatively, ananion vacancy may be associated with either an anioninterstitialor a cationvacancy. The vacancy-interstitialpair is called a Frenkel defect and the vacancy pair a
Schottky defect, as shown in Figure 4.5. Interstitials
are much more common in ionic structures than metal-lic structures because of the large ‘holes’ or intersticesthat are available.
Ingeneral,theformationenergyofeachofthesetwo
types of defect is different and this leads to differentdefect concentrations. With regard to vacancies, when

However,the electrical ﬁeld produced will eventually opposethe production of further cations and promote theformation of anions such that of equilibrium therewill be almost equal numbers of both types and the

combined or total concentration cof Schottky defects
at high temperatures is ¾10/NUL4.
Foreign ions with a valency different from the host
cation may also give rise to point defects to maintain
chargeneutrality.Monovalentsodiumionssubstituting
for divalent magnesium ions in MgO, for example,
must be associated with an appropriate number of
either cation interstitials or anion vacancies in order
to maintain charge neutrality. Deviations from the sto-
ichiometric composition of the non-metallic material
as a result of excess (or deﬁciency) in one (or other)atomic species also results in the formation of point
defects.
An example of excess-metal due to anion vacancies
isfoundintheoxidationofsiliconwhichtakesplaceat
the metal/oxide interface. Interstitials are more likely
to occur in oxides with open crystal structures and
when one atom is much smaller than the other as, for
example, ZnO (Figure 4.6a). The oxidation of copper
to Cu
2O, shown in Figure 4.6b, is an example of non-
stoichiometry involving cation vacancies. Thus copper
vacancies are created at the oxide surface and diffuse
through the oxide layer and are eliminated at the
oxide/metal interface.
Oxides which contain point defects behave as semi-
conductors when the electrons associated with the
point defects either form positive holes or enter the
conduction band of the oxide. If the electrons remain
locally associated with the point defects, then chargecan only be transferred by the diffusion of the charge
carrying defects through the oxide. Both p-a n d n-type
semiconductors are formed when oxides deviate from
stoichiometry: the former arises from a deﬁciency of
cations and the latter from an excess of cations.
Examplesof p-typesemiconductingoxidesareNiO,
PbO and Cu 2O while the oxides of Zn, Cd and Be are
n-type semiconductors.
4.2.3 Irradiation of solids
There are many different kinds of high-energy radi-
ation (e.g. neutrons, electrons, ˛-particles, protons,
deuterons, uranium ﬁssion fragments, /CR-rays, X-rays)
and all of them are capable of producing some form
of ‘radiation damage’ in the materials they irradiate.
While all are of importance to some aspects of the
solid state, of particular interest is the behaviour ofmaterials under irradiation in a nuclear reactor. This is
because the neutrons produced in a reactor by a ﬁs-
sion reaction have extremely high energies of about2 million electron volts (i.e. 2 MeV), and being elec-
trically uncharged, and consequently unaffected by the
electrical ﬁelds surrounding an atomic nucleus, cantravel large distances through a structure. The resul-
tantdamageisthereforenotlocalized,butisdistributed
throughout the solid in the form of ‘damage spikes.’
The fast neutrons (they are given this name because
2 MeV corresponds to a velocity of 2 ð10
7ms/NUL1/triangleleft
are slowed down, in order to produce further ﬁssion,

by the moderator in the pile until they are in thermal
equilibrium with their surroundings. The neutrons ina pile will, therefore, have a spectrum of energieswhich ranges from about 1/40 eV at room temperature(thermal neutrons)to2 MeV (fastneutrons).However,when non-ﬁssile material is placed in a reactor andirradiated most of the damage is caused by thefast neutrons colliding with the atomic nuclei of thematerial.
The nucleus of an atom has a small diameter (e.g.
10
/NUL10m), and consequently the largest area, or cross-
section, which it presents to the neutron for collisionis also small. The unit of cross-section is a barn, i.e.10
/NUL28m2so that in a material with a cross-section
of 1 barn, an average of 109neutrons would have to
pass through an atom (cross-sectional area 10/NUL19m2)
for one to hit the nucleus. Conversely, the mean free
path between collisions is about 109atom spacings or
about 0.3 m. If a metal such as copper (cross-section,
4 barns) were irradiated for 1 day ⊿105s/triangleleftin a neutron
ﬂux of 1017m/NUL2s/NUL1the number of neutrons passing
through unit area, i.e. the integrated ﬂux, would be
1022nm/NUL2and the chance of a given atom being hit
⊿Dintegrated ﬂux ðcross-section /triangleleftwould be 4 ð10/NUL6,
i.e. about 1 atom in 250000 would have its nucleusstruck.
For most metals the collision between an atomic
nucleus and a neutron (or other fast particle of massm) is usually purely elastic, and the struck atom
mass Mwill have equal probability of receiving any
kinetic energy between zero and the maximum E
maxD
4EnMm/⊿M Cm/triangleleft2,w h e r e Enis the energy of the fast
neutron. Thus, the most energetic neutrons can impartan energy of as much as 200000 eV, to a copper
atom initially at rest. Such an atom, called a primary
‘knock-on’, will do much further damage on its sub-sequent passage through the structure often producingsecondary and tertiary knock-on atoms, so that severelocal damage results. The neutron, of course, also con-tinues its passage through the structure producing fur-ther primary displacements until the energy transferredin collisions is less than the energy E
d(³25 eV for
copper) necessary to displace an atom from its lat-tice site.
The damage produced in irradiation consists largely
of interstitials, i.e. atoms knocked into interstitial posi-tions in the lattice, and vacancies, i.e. the holes theyleave behind. The damaged region, estimated to con-tain about 60000 atoms, is expected to be originallypear-shaped in form, having the vacancies at the cen-tre and the interstitials towards the outside. Such adisplacement spike or cascade of displaced atoms isshown schematically in Figure 4.7. The number ofvacancy-interstitial pairs produced by one primary
knock-on is given by n'E
max/4Ed, and for copper
is about 1000. Owing to the thermal motion of theatoms in the lattice, appreciable self-annealing of thedamage will take place at all except the lowest tem-peratures, with most of the vacancies and interstitials
Figure 4.7 Formation of vacancies and interstitials due to
particle bombardment (after Cottrell, 1959; courtesy of theInstitute of Mechanical Engineers) .
annihilating each other by recombination. However, it
is expected that some of the interstitials will escapefrom the surface of the cascade leaving a correspond-ing number of vacancies in the centre. If this numberis assumed to be 100, the local concentration will be
100/60000 or ³2ð10
/NUL3.
Anothermanifestation of radiation damage concerns
the dispersal of the energy of the stopped atom intothe vibrational energy of the lattice. The energy isdeposited in a small region, and for a very shorttime the metal may be regarded as locally heated. Todistinguish this damage from the ‘displacement spike’,where the energy is sufﬁcient to displace atoms, thisheat-affectedzonehasbeencalleda‘thermalspike’.To
raise the temperature by 1000
°C requires about 3 Rð
4.2 kJ/mol or about 0.25 eV per atom. Consequently,
a 25 eV thermal spike could heat about 100 atomsof copper to the melting point, which correspondsto a spherical region of radius about 0.75 nm. It isvery doubtful if melting actually takes place, because
the duration of the heat pulse is only about 10
/NUL11to
10/NUL12s. However, it is not clear to what extent the
heat producedgives riseto an annealingof theprimarydamage, or causes additional quenching damage (e.g.retention of high-temperature phases).
Slow neutrons give rise to transmutation products.
Of particular importance is the production of the noblegas elements, e.g. krypton and xenon produced by ﬁs-sion in U and Pu, and helium in the light elements
B, Li, Be and Mg. These transmuted atoms can cause
severe radiation damage in two ways. First, the inertgasatomsarealmostinsolubleandhenceinassociationwith vacancies collect into gas bubbles which swelland crack the material. Second, these atoms are oftencreated with very high energies (e.g. as ˛-particles
or ﬁssion fragments) and act as primary sources ofknock-on damage. The ﬁssion of uranium into twonew elements is the extreme example when the ﬁs-
sion fragments are thrown apart with kinetic energy
³100 MeV. However, because the fragments carry
a large charge their range is short and the damagerestricted to the ﬁssile material itself, or in materi-als which are in close proximity. Heavy ions can be

accelerated to kilovolt energies in accelerators to pro-
duce heavy ion bombardment of materials being testedfor reactor application. These moving particles have ashort range and the damage is localized.

Excess point defects are removed from a mate-

regions of discontinuity in the structure (e.g. free sur-
faces, grain boundaries or dislocations) and are annihi-lated. These sites are termed defect sinks. The average

Assuming a random walk process, single vacancies

either the distance to the grain boundary or the spac-

duces a chemical stress, somewhat analogous to an
osmotic pressure, which is sufﬁciently large to createnew dislocations in the structure which provide manynew ‘sinks’ to reduce this stress rapidly.
The magnitude of this chemical stress may be

For aluminium, Efis about 0.7 eV so that quench-
ing from 900 K to 300 K produces a chemical stress
of about 3 GN/m2. This stress is extremely high, sev-
eral times the theoretical yield stress, and must be
relieved in some way. Migration of vacancies to grain
boundaries and dislocations will occur, of course, but
it is not surprising that the point defects form addi-
tional vacancy sinks by the spontaneous nucleation of
dislocations and other stable lattice defects, such as
voids and stacking fault tetrahedra (see Sections 4.5.3
and 4.6).
When the material contains both vacancies and
interstitials the removal of the excess point defect
concentration is more complex. Figure 4.9 shows
the ‘annealing’ curve for irradiated copper. The
resistivity decreases sharply around 20 K when the
interstitials start to migrate, with an activation
energy Em¾0.1 eV. In Stage I, therefore, most
of the Frenkel (interstitial–vacancy) pairs anneal
out. Stage II has been attributed to the release of
interstitials from impurity traps as thermal energy
supplies the necessary activation energy. Stage III is

around room temperature and is probably caused by
the annihilation of free interstitials with individual
vacancies not associated with a Frenkel pair, and also
the migration of di-vacancies. Stage IV corresponds to
the stage I annealing of quenched metals arising fromvacancy migration and annihilationto form dislocation
loops, voids and other defects. Stage V corresponds
to the removal of this secondary defect population by
self-diffusion.
4.3 Line defects
4.3.1 Concept of a dislocation
All crystalline materials usually contain lines of struc-
tural discontinuities running throughout each crystal
or grain. These line discontinuities are termed dislo-
cations and there is usually about 1010to 1012mo f
dislocation line in a metre cube of material.1Disloca-
tionsenablematerialstodeformwithoutdestroyingthe
basic crystal structure at stresses below that at which
the material would break or fracture if they were not
present.
A crystal changes its shape during deformation by
the slipping of atomic layers over one another. The
theoretical shear strength of perfect crystals was ﬁrst
calculated by Frenkel for the simple rectangular-type
lattice shown in Figure 4.10 with spacing abetween
1This is usually expressed as the density of dislocations

theplanes.Theshearingforcerequiredtomoveaplane
of atoms over the plane below will be periodic, since
for displacements x<b /2, where bis the spacing of
atoms in the shear direction, the lattice resists theapplied stress but for x>b /2 the lattice forces assist
the applied stress. The simplest function with theseproperties is a sinusoidal relation of the form
/FSD/FS
msin⊿2/EMx/b/triangleleft '/FSm2/EMx/b
where /FSmis the maximum shear stress at a
displacement Db/4. For small displacements the
elastic shear strain given by x/ais equal to /FS//SYNfrom
Hooke’s law, where /SYNis the shear modulus, so that
/FSmD⊿/EM/2/EM/triangleleftb/a (4.7)
and since b'a, the theoretical strength of a perfect
crystal is of the order of /SYN/10.
This calculation shows that crystals should be rather
strong and difﬁcult to deform, but a striking exper-imental property of single crystals is their softness,which indicates that the critical shear stress to pro-
duceslipisverysmall(about10
/NUL5µor³50gf mm/NUL2).
This discrepancy between the theoretical and experi-mental strength of crystals is accounted for if atomicplanes do not slip over each other as rigid bodies butinstead slip starts at a localized region in the structureand then spreads gradually over the remainder of theplane, somewhat like the disturbance when a pebble isdropped into a pond.
In general, therefore, the slip plane may be divided
into two regions, one where slip has occurred and theother which remains unslipped. Between the slippedand unslipped regions the structure will be dislocated(Figure 4.11); this boundary is referred to as a dislo-cation line, or dislocation. Three simple properties ofa dislocation are immediately apparent, namely: (1) itis a line discontinuity, (2) it forms a closed loop in theinterior of the crystal or emerges at the surface and(3) the difference in the amount of slip across the dis-
location line is constant. The last property is probably
the most important, since a dislocation is characterizedby the magnitude and direction of the slip movementassociated with it. This is called the Burgers vector,b, which for any given dislocation line is the same all
along its length.
4.3.2 Edge and screw dislocations
It is evident from Figure 4.11a that some sectionsof the dislocation line are perpendicular to b,o t h e r s
are parallel to bwhile the remainder lie at an angle
tob. This variation in the orientation of the line
with respect to the Burgers vector gives rise to adifference in the structure of the dislocation. Whenthe dislocation line is normal to the slip direction it iscalled an edge dislocation. In contrast, when the lineof the dislocations is parallel to the slip direction thedislocation line is known as a screw dislocation. Fromthe diagram shown in Figure 4.11a it is evident that
Figure 4.11 Schematic representation of (a) a dislocation
loop, (b) edge dislocation and (c) screw dislocation .
the dislocation line is rarely pure edge or pure screw,
but it is convenient to think of these ideal dislocationssince any dislocation can be resolved into edge andscrew components. The atomic structure of a simple
edge and screw dislocation is shown in Figure 4.13
and 4.14.
4.3.3 The Burgers vector
ItisevidentfromtheprevioussectionsthattheBurgersvector bis an important dislocation parameter. In any
deformation situation the Burgers vector is deﬁned by
constructing a Burgers circuit in the dislocated crystalas shown in Figure 4.12. A sequence of lattice vectors
is taken to form a closed clockwise circuit around
the dislocation. The same sequence of vectors is thentaken in the perfect lattice when it is found that the
circuit fails to close. The closure vector FS (ﬁnish-
start) deﬁnes bfor the dislocation. With this FS/RH
(right-hand) convention it is necessary to choose onedirection along the dislocation line as positive. If this
direction is reversed the vector bis also reversed.
The Burgers vector deﬁnes the atomic displacementproduced as the dislocation moves across the slip
plane. Its value is governed by the crystal structure
because duringslipitis necessary toretain an identicallattice structure both before and after the passage ofthe dislocation. This is assured if the dislocation has

a Burgers vector equal to one lattice vector and, since
the energy of a dislocation depends on the square ofthe Burgers vector (see Section 4.3.5.2), its Burgers
vector is usually the shortest available lattice vector.
This vector, by deﬁnition, is parallel to the directionof closest packing in the structure, which agrees with
experimental observation of the slip direction.
The Burgers vector is conveniently speciﬁed by
its directional co-ordinates along the principal crys-
tal axes. In the fcc lattice, the shortest lattice vectoris associated with slip from a cube corner to a face
centre, and has components a/2,a/2, 0. This is usu-
ally written a/2[110], where ais the lattice parameter
and [110] is the slip direction. The magnitude of the
vector, or the strength of the dislocation, is then given
by

ing slip vectors for the bcc and cph structures are
bDa/2[111] and bDa/3[1120] respectively.
4.3.4 Mechanisms of slip and climb
The atomic structure of an edge dislocation is shown
in Figure 4.13a. Here the extra half-plane of atoms is
above the slip plane of the crystal, and consequently
the dislocationis called a positiveedge dislocationand
is often denotedby the symbol ?. When the half-plane
is below the slip plane it is termed a negative disloca-tion. If the resolved shear stress on the slip plane is /FS
and the Burgers vector of the dislocation b, the force
on the dislocation, i.e. force per unit length of dislo-cation, is FD/FSb. This can be seen by reference toFigure 4.13 if the crystal is of side L. The force on the

ing the dislocation ⊿total force on dislocation FL ð

movement of a dislocation under the action of such aforce. The extra half-plane moves to the right until
it produces the slip step shown at the surface of the
crystal; the same shear will be produced by a negative
dislocation moving from the right to left.

The slip process as a result of a screw dislocation is
shown in Figure 4.14. It must be recognized, however,that the dislocation is more usually a closed loop and
slip occurs by the movement of all parts of the dislo-
cation loop, i.e. edge, screw and mixed components,as shown in Figure 4.15.
A dislocation is able to glide in that slip plane
which contains both the line of the dislocation and
its Burgers vector. The edge dislocation is conﬁnedto glide in one plane only. An important difference
between the motion of a screw dislocation and that of
1An obvious analogy to the slip process is the movement of
a caterpillar in the garden or the propagation of a ruck in a
carpet to move the carpet into place. In both examples, the
effort to move is much reduced by this propagation process.

Figure 4.15 Process of slip by the expansion of a
dislocation loop in the slip plane .
an edge dislocation arises from the fact that the screw
dislocation is cylindrically symmetrical about its axis
withits bparalleltothisaxis.Toascrewdislocationall
crystal planes passing through the axis look the same
and, therefore, the motion of the screw dislocation is
not restricted to a single slip plane, as is the case
for a gliding edge dislocation. The process thereby a
screw dislocation glides into another slip plane having
a slip direction in common with the original slip plane,
as shown in Figure 4.16, is called cross-slip. Usually,
the cross-slip plane is also a close-packed plane, e.g.
f111gin fcc crystals.
The mechanism of slip illustrated above shows that
the slip or glide motion of an edge dislocation is
restricted, since it can only glide in that slip plane
Figure 4.16 Cross-slip of a screw dislocation in a crystal .which contains both the dislocation line and its Burg-
ers vector. However, movement of the dislocation linein a direction normal to the slip plane can occur under
certain circumstances; this is called dislocation climb.
To move the extra half-plane either up or down, as is
required for climb, requires mass transport by diffu-
sion and is a non-conservative motion. For example,
if vacancies diffuse to the dislocation line it climbs up
and the extra half-plane will shorten. However, since
the vacancies will not necessarily arrive at the disloca-
tion at the same instant, or uniformly, the dislocationclimbs one atom at a time and some sections will lie in
one plane and other sections in parallel neighbouring
planes. Where the dislocation deviates from one plane
to another it is known as a jog, and from the diagrams
of Figure 4.17 it is evident that a jog in a dislocation
may be regarded as a short length of dislocation not
lying in the same slip plane as the main dislocationbut having the same Burgers vector.
Jogs may also form when a moving dislocation cuts
through intersecting dislocations, i.e. forest
1disloca-
tions, during its glide motion. In the lower range of
temperature this will be the major source of jogs. Two
examples of jogs formed from the crossings of dislo-
cations are shown in Figure 4.18. Figure 4.18a showsa crystal containing a screw dislocation running from
top to bottom which has the effect of ‘ramping’ all
the planes in the crystal. If an edge dislocation moves
throughthecrystalonahorizontalplanethenthescrew
dislocation becomes jogged as the top half of the crys-
tal is sheared relative to the bottom. In addition, the
screwdislocationbecomesjoggedsinceoneparthasto
take the upper ramp and the other part the lower ramp.
The result is shown schematically in Figure 4.18b.Figure 4.18c shows the situation for a moving screw
cutting through the vertical screw; the jog formed in
each dislocation is edge in character since it is per-
pendicular to its Burgers vector which lies along the
screw axis.
A jog in an edge dislocation will not impede the
motion of the dislocation in its slip plane because itcan, in general, move with the main dislocation line
by glide, not in the same slip plane (see Figure 4.17b)
Figure 4.17 Climb of an edge dislocation in a crystal .
1A number of dislocation lines may project from the slip
plane like a forest, hence the term ‘forest dislocation’.

but in an intersecting slip plane that does contain the
line of the jog and the Burgers vector. In the caseof a jog in a screw dislocation the situation is not so
clear, since there are two ways in which the jog can
move. Since the jog is merely a small piece of edge
dislocation it may move sideways, i.e. conservatively,
along the screw dislocation and attach itself to an edge
component of the dislocation line. Conversely, the jog
may be dragged along with the screw dislocation. Thislatter process requires the jog to climb and, because
it is a non-conservative process, must give rise to
the creation of a row of point defects, i.e. either
vacancies or interstitials depending on which way the
jog is forced to climb. Clearly, such a movement is
difﬁcultbut,nevertheless,maybenecessarytogivethe
dislocation sufﬁcient mobility. The ‘frictional’ drag of

jogs will make a contribution to the work-hardening1
of the material.
Apartfromelementaryjogs,orthosehavingaheight
equal to one atomic plane spacing, it is possible to
have multiple jogs where the jog height is severalatomic plane spacings. Such jogs can be produced,for example, by part of a screw dislocation cross-slippingfrom the primary plane to the cross-slipplane,
as shown in Figure 4.19a. In this case, as the screw
dislocation glides forward it trails the multiple jogbehind, since it acts as a frictional drag. As a result,two parallel dislocations of opposite sign are cre-ated in the wake of the moving screw, as shown in
Figure 4.19b; this arrangement is called a dislocation
dipole. Dipoles formed as debris behind moving dis-locations are frequently seen in electron micrographstaken from deformed crystals (see Chapter 7). As thedipole gets longer the screw dislocation will eventu-
ally jettison the debris by cross-slipping and pinching
off the dipole to form a prismatic loop, as shown inFigure 4.20. The loop is capable of gliding on the sur-face of a prism, the cross-sectional area of which is
that of the loop.
Figure 4.20 Formation of prismatic dislocation loop from

1When material is deformed by straining or working the
ﬂow stress increases with increase in strain (i.e. it is harder
to deform a material which has been strained already). This
is called strain- or work-hardening.

4.3.5.2 Strain energy of a dislocation
A dislocation is a line defect extending over largedistances in the crystal and, since it has a strain energy
per unit length (J m
/NUL1), it possesses a total strain
energy. An estimate of the elastic strain energy of
screw dislocation can be obtained by taking the strain
energy (i.e.1
2ðstressðstrain per unit volume) in an
annular ring around the dislocation of radius rand

then obtained by integrating from r0the core radius,

dislocation line which leads to a large amount of
energy stored in the lattice (i.e. ³4J/g for Cu). Clearly,
because of this high line energy a dislocation line will
always tend to shorten its length as much as possi-
ble, and from this point of view it may be considered
to possess a line tension, T³˛/SYNb2, analogous to the
surface energy of a soap ﬁlm, where ˛³1

4.3.5.3 Interaction of dislocations
The strain ﬁeld around a dislocation, because of its
long-range nature, is also important in inﬂuencing the
behaviour of other dislocations in the crystal. Thus, itis not difﬁcult to imagine that a positive dislocation
will attract a negative dislocation lying on the same
slip plane in order that their respective strain ﬁeldsshould cancel. Moreover, as a general rule it can be
said that the dislocations in a crystal will interact with
each other to take up positions of minimum energy toreduce the total strain energy of the lattice.
Two dislocations of the same sign will repel each
other, because the strain energy of two dislocations
on moving apart would be 2 ðb
2whereas if they
combined to form one dislocation of Burgers vec-
tor 2b, the strain energy would then be ⊿2b/triangleleft2D4b2;
a force of repulsion exists between them. The force
is, by deﬁnition, equal to the change of energy with
position ⊿dE/dr/triangleleftand for screw dislocations is simply
FD/SYNb2/2/EMrwhere ris the distance between the two
dislocations. Since the stress ﬁeld around screw dislo-
cations has cylindrical symmetry the force of inter-
action depends only on the distance apart, and the
above expression for Fapplies equally well to par-
allel screw dislocations on neighbouring slip planes.
For parallel edge dislocations the force–distance rela-
tionshipislesssimple.Whenthetwoedgedislocationslie in the same slip plane the relation is similar to that
for two screws and has the form FD/SYNb
2/⊿1/NUL/ETB/triangleleft2/EMr,
but for edge dislocations with the same Burgers vectorbut not on the same slip plane the force also dependson the angle /DC2between the Burgers vector and the line
joining the two dislocations (Figure 4.22a).
Edge dislocations of the same sign repel and oppo-
site sign attract along the line between them, but the
component of force in the direction of slip, which gov-
erns the motion of a dislocation, varies with the angle
/DC2. With unlike dislocations an attractive force is expe-
rienced for /DC2>45
°but a repulsive force for /DC2<45°,
and in equilibrium the dislocations remain at an angle
of 45°to each other. For like dislocations the converse
appliesandtheposition /DC2D45°isnowoneofunstable
equilibrium. Thus, edge dislocations which have the
same Burgers vector but which do not lie on the same
slip plane will be in equilibrium when /DC2D90°,a n d
consequently they will arrange themselves in a plane
normal to theslipplane, oneabove the othera distance
hapart. Such a wall of dislocationsconstitutesa small-
angle grain boundary as shown in Figure 4.22b, where
the angle across the boundary is given by Db/h.
This type of dislocation array is also called a sub-
grain or low-angle boundary, and is important in the
annealing of deformed metals.
By this arrangement the long-range stresses from
the individual dislocations are cancelled out beyond a
distance of the order of hfrom the boundary. It then
follows that the energy of the crystal boundary will
be given approximately by the sum of the individual
energies, each equal to f/SYNb2/4/EM⊿1/NUL/ETB/triangleleftgln⊿h/r0/triangleleftper

‘half-plane’ made up of a sheet of Na
Cions and one of
Cl/NULions. The line as a whole can be charged up to a
maximum of e/2 per atom length by acting as a source
or sink for point defects. Figure 4.23b shows differentjogs in the line which may either carry a charge or be
uncharged. The jogs at B and C would be of charge
Ce/2 because the section BC has a net charge equal

4.4.1 Grain boundaries
The small-angle boundary described in Section 4.3.5.3
is a particular example of a planar defect interface ina crystal. Many such planar defects occur in materialsranging from the large-angle grain boundary, which isan incoherent interface with a relatively highenergy of
¾0.5J / m

there isamis-stackingoftheatoms, i.e. twininterfacesand stacking faults which retain the coherency of the
packing and have much lower energies ⊿
/H113890.1J / m2/triangleleft.
Generally, all these planar defects are associated withdislocations in an extended form.
A small-angle tilt boundary can be described ade-
quately by a vertical wall of dislocations. Rotation ofone crystal relative to another, i.e. a twist boundary,can be produced by a crossed grid of two sets of screwdislocations as shown in Figure 4.24. These bound-aries are of a particularly simple kind separating twocrystals which have a small difference in orientation,whereas a general grain boundary usually separatescrystals which differ in orientation by large angles. Inthis case, the boundary has ﬁve degrees of freedom,three of which arise from the fact that the adjoin-ing crystals may be rotated with respect to each otherabout the three perpendicular axes, and the other twofrom the degree of freedom of the orientation of theboundary surface itself with respect to the crystals.
Such a large-angle ⊿30–40
°/triangleleftgrain boundary may sim-
ply be regarded as a narrow region, about two atomsthick, across which the atoms change from the latticeorientation of the one grain to that of the other. Nev-ertheless, such a grain boundary may be described byan arrangement of dislocations, but their arrangementwill be complex and the individual dislocationsare noteasily recognized or analysed.
The simplest extension of the dislocation model for
low-angle boundaries to high-angle grain boundariesis to consider that there are islands of good atomicﬁt surrounded by non-coherent regions. In a low-angleboundary the ‘good ﬁt’ is perfect crystal and the ‘bad

ﬁt’ is accommodated by lattice dislocations, whereas
for high-angle boundaries the ‘good ﬁt’ could be an
interfacial structure with low energy and the bad ﬁt
accommodated by dislocations which are not neces-
sarily lattice dislocations. These dislocations are often
termed intrinsic secondary grain boundary dislocations
(gbds) and are essential to maintain the boundary atthat mis-orientation.
The regions of good ﬁt are sometimes described
by the coincident site lattice (CSL) model, with its
developmenttoincludethedisplacementshiftcomplex
(DSC) lattice. A CSL is a three-dimensional super-
lattice on which a fraction 1 //summationtextof the lattice points
in both crystal lattices lie; for the simple structuresthere will be many such CSLs, each existing at a
particular misorientation. One CSL is illustrated in
Figure 4.25 but it must be remembered that the CSL
is three-dimensional, inﬁnite and interpenetrates both
crystals; it does not in itself deﬁne an interface. How-
ever, an interface is likely to have a low energy if
it lies between two crystals oriented such that they
share a high proportion of lattice sites, i.e. preferred
misorientations will be those with CSLs having low
/summationtextvalues. Such misorientations can be predicted from

The CSL model can only be used to describe cer-
tain speciﬁc boundary misorientations but it can be

ondary dislocations must conserve the boundary struc-
ture and, generally, will have Burgers vectors smaller
than those of the lattice dislocations.
When a polycrystalline specimen is examined in
TEMotherstructuralfeaturesapartfromintrinsicgrainboundary dislocations (gbds) may be observed in agrain boundary, such as ‘extrinsic’ dislocations whichhave probably run-in from a neighbouring grain, andinterface ledges or steps which curve the boundary. Atlow temperatures the run-in lattice dislocation tendsto retain its character while trapped in the interface,whereas at high temperatures it may dissociate intoseveral intrinsic gbds resulting in a small change inmisorientation across the boundary. The analysis ofgbds in TEM is not easy, but information about themwill eventually further our understanding of importantboundary phenomena (e.g. migration of boundariesduring recrystallization and grain growth, the slidingof grains during creep and superplastic ﬂow and thewaygrainboundariesactassourcesandsinksforpointdefects).
4.4.2 Twin boundaries
Annealing of cold-worked fcc metals and alloys, suchas copper, ˛-brass and austenitic stainless steels usu-
ally causes many of the constituent crystals to formannealing twins. The lattice orientation changes at thetwin boundary surface, producing a structure in whichone part of the crystal or grain is the mirror-image ofthe other, the amount of atomic displacement beingproportional to the distance from the twin boundary.
The surfaces of a sample within and outside an
annealingtwinhavedifferentsurfaceenergies,because
oftheirdifferentlatticeorientations,andhencerespondquite differently when etched with a chemical etchant(Figure 4.26). In this diagram, twins 1 and 2 bothhave two straight parallel sides which are coherentlow-energy interfaces. The short end face of twin 2 isnon-coherentandtherefore hasahigherenergycontent

per unit surface. Stacking faults are also coherent
and low in energy content; consequently, because of
this similarity in character, we ﬁnd that crystallinematerials which twin readily are also likely to contain
many stacking faults (e.g. copper, ˛-brass).
Although less important and less common than slip,
another type of twinning can take place during plas-
tic deformation. These so-called deformation twins
sometimes form very easily, e.g. during mechanical
polishing of metallographic samples of pure zinc; this
process is discussed in Chapter 7.
The free energies of interfaces can be determined
from the equilibrium form of the triple junction where
three interfaces, such as surfaces, grain boundariesor twins, meet. For the case of a grain boundary
intersecting a free surface, shown in Figure 4.27,

4.4.3 Extended dislocations and stacking
faults in close-packed crystals
4.4.3.1 Stacking faults
Stacking faults associated with dislocations can be
an extremely signiﬁcant feature of the structure ofmany materials, particularly those with fcc and cph
structure. They arise because to a ﬁrst approximation
there is little to choose electrostatically between the
stacking sequence of the close-packed planes in the
fcc metals ABCABC ...and that in the cph metals
ABABAB ...Thus, in a metal like copper or gold, the
atoms in a part of one of the close-packed layers may
fall into the ‘wrong’ position relative to the atoms ofthe layers above and below, so that a mistake in the
stackingsequenceoccurs(e.g. ABCBCABC ...).Such
an arrangement will be reasonably stable, but becausesome work will have to be done to produce it, stacking
faults are more frequently found in deformed metals
than annealed metals.4.4.3.2 Dissociation into Shockley partials
The relationship between the two close-packed struc-
tures cph and fcc has been discussed in Chapter 2
where it was seen that both structures may be built
up from stacking close-packed planes of spheres. Theshortest lattice vector in the fcc structure joins a cubecorner atom to a neighbouring face centre atom and
deﬁnes the observed slip direction; one such slip vec-
tora/2[10
1] is shown as b1in Figure 4.28a which
is for glide in the ⊿111/triangleleftplane. However, an atom
which sits in a Bposition on top of the A plane would
move most easily initially towards a Cposition and,
consequently, to produce a macroscopical slip move-
ment along [10 1] the atoms might be expected to
take a zigzag path of the type B!C!Bfollowing
the vectors b2Da/6[211] and b3Da/6[112] alter-
nately. It will be evident, of course, that during the
initial part of the slip process when the atoms change
fromBpositions to Cpositions, a stacking fault in the
⊿111/triangleleftlayers is produced and the stacking sequence
changes from ABCABC ...toABCACABC ....D u r -
ing the second part of the slip process the correctstacking sequence is restored.
To describe the atoms movement during slip, dis-
cussed above, Heidenreich and Shockley have pointed
out that the unit dislocation must dissociate into twohalf dislocations,
1which for the case of glide in the
⊿111/triangleleftplane would be according to the reaction:
a/2[101]!a/6[211]Ca/6[112]
Suchadissociationprocessis(1) algebraicallycorrect,
since the sum of the Burgers vector components of thetwo partial dislocations, i.e. a/6[2C1],a/6[1C1],
a/6[1C2], are equal to the components of the Burg-
ers vector of the unit dislocation, i.e. a/2, 0,
a/2,
and (2) energetically favourable, since the sum of the
strain energy values for the pair of half dislocations
is less than the strain energy value of the single unitdislocation, where the initial dislocation energy is pro-
portional to b

Shockley partial dislocations, repel each other by a
force that is approximately FD⊿/SYNb2b3cos60 /triangleleft/2/EMd,
and separate as shown in Figure 4.28b. A sheet ofstackingfaultsisthen formed in theslipplane betweenthe partials, and it is the creation of this faulted region,
which has a higher energy than the normal lattice, that
prevents the partials from separating too far. Thus, if
/CRJ/m

per unit length exerted on the dislocations by the fault
is/CRN/m and the equilibrium separation dis given by
equating the repulsive force Fbetween the two half
dislocations to the force exerted by the fault, /CR.T h e

dislocation reactions can be obtained from Figure 4.37.

strain energy along a line through the crystal associ-
ated with an undissociated dislocation is spread overa plane in the crystal for a dissociated dislocation (seeFigure 4.29d) thereby lowering its energy.
A direct estimate of /CRcan be made from the obser-
vation of extended dislocations in the electron micro-scope and from observations on other stacking fault
Defects in solids 101
defects (see Chapter 5). Such measurements show that
the stacking fault energy for pure fcc metals ranges
from about 16 mJ/m2for silver to ³200 mJ/m2for
nickel, with gold ³30, copper ³40 and aluminium
135 mJ/m2, respectively. Since stacking faults are
coherent interfaces or boundaries they have energiesconsiderably lower than non-coherent interfaces such
as free surfaces for which /CR

grain boundaries for which /CRgb³/CRs/3³0.5J / m2.
The energy of a stacking fault can be estimated
from twin boundary energies since a stacking fault
ABCBCABC may be regarded as two overlapping
twin boundaries CBCandBCBacross which the next
nearest neighbouring plane are wrongly stacked. In fcc
crystals any sequence of three atomic planes not intheABCorCBAorder is a stacking violation and
is accompanied by an increased energy contribution.
A twin has one pair of second nearest neighbourplanes in the wrong sequence, two third neighbours,
one fourth neighbour and so on; an intrinsic stacking
fault two second nearest neighbours, three third and nofourth nearest neighbour violations. Thus, if next-nextnearest neighbour interactions are considered to make
a relatively small contribution to the energy then an
approximate relation /CR'2/CR
Tis expected.
Thefrequencyofoccurrenceofannealingtwinsgen-
erally conﬁrms the above classiﬁcation of stacking
fault energy and it is interesting to note that in alu-minium, a metal with a relatively high value of /CR,
annealingtwinsarerarely,ifever,observed,whilethey
are seen in copper which has a lower stacking faultenergy. Electron microscope measurements of /CRshow
that the stacking fault energy is lowered by solid solu-
tion alloying and is inﬂuenced by those factors whichaffect the limit of primary solubility. The reason for
this is that on alloying, the free energies of the ˛-phase
and its neighbouring phase become more nearly equal,i.e. the stability of the ˛-phase is decreased relative to
some other phase, and hence can more readily tolerate
mis-stacking. Figure 4.30 shows the reduction of /CRfor
copper with addition of solutes such as Zn, Al, Sn and
Ge, and is consistent with the observation that anneal-
ing twins occur more frequently in ˛-brass or Cu–Sn
than pure copper. Substituting the appropriate values
for/SYN, aand/CRinequation (4.13)indicatesthatinsilver
Figure 4.30 Decrease in stacking-fault energy /CRfor copper
with alloying addition ( e/a).and copper the partials are separated to about 12 and
6 atom spacings, respectively. For nickel the width isabout 2 bsince although nickel has a high /CRits shear
modulus is also very high. In contrast, aluminium has
al o w e r /CR³135 mJ/m
2but also a considerably lower
value for /SYNand hence the partial separation is limited
to about 1 band may be considered to be unextended.
Alloying signiﬁcantly reduces /CRand very wide dislo-
cations are produced, as found in the brasses, bronzesandausteniticstainlesssteels.However,nomatterhow
narrow or how wide the partials are separated the two
half-dislocations are bound together by the stackingfault, and consequently, they must move together as aunit across the slip plane.
The width of the stacking fault ribbon is of impor-
tance in many aspects of plasticity because at some
stage of deformation it becomes necessary for disloca-
tions to intersect each other; the difﬁculty which dislo-cationshaveinintersectingeach othergivesrisetoonesource of work-hardening. With extended dislocationsthe intersecting process is particularly difﬁcult sincethe crossing of stacking faults would lead to a com-plex fault in the plane of intersection. The complexity
may be reduced, however, if the half-dislocations coa-
lesce at the crossing point, so that they intersect asperfect dislocations; the partials then are constrictedtogether at their jogs, as shown in Figure 4.31a.
The width of the stacking fault ribbon is also impor-
tant to the phenomenon of cross-slip in which a
dislocation changes from one slip plane to another
intersecting slip plane. As discussed previously, forglide to occur the slip plane must contain both theBurgers vector and the line of the dislocation, and,consequently, for cross-slip to take place a dislocation

dislocation .
102Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
must be in an exact screw orientation. If the dislo-
cation is extended, however, the partials have ﬁrst to
be brought together to form an unextended dislocation
as shown in Figure 4.31b before the dislocation can
spread into the cross-slip plane. The constriction pro-cess will be aided by thermal activation and hence the
cross-slip tendency increases with increasing temper-
ature. The constriction process is also more difﬁcult,
the wider the separation of the partials. In aluminium,
where the dislocations are relatively unextended, thefrequent occurrence of cross-slip is expected, but for
low stacking fault energy metals (e.g. copper or gold)
theactivationenergy for theprocess willbe high.Nev-
ertheless, cross-slip may still occur in those regions
where a high concentration of stress exists, as, for
example,whendislocationspileupagainstsomeobsta-
cle, where the width of the extended dislocation maybe reduced below the equilibrium separation. Often
screw dislocations escape from the piled-up group by
cross-slipping but then after moving a certain distance
in this cross-slip plane return to a plane parallel to the
original slip plane because the resolved shear stressis higher. This is a common method of circumventing
obstacles in the structure.
4.4.3.3 Sessile dislocations
The Shockley partial dislocation has its Burgers vec-
tor lying in the plane of the fault and hence is glissile.Some dislocations, however, have their Burgers vector
not lying in the plane of the fault with which they are
associated, and are incapable of gliding, i.e. they are
sessile. The simplest of these, the Frank sessile dislo-
cation loop, is shown in Figure 4.32a. This dislocationis believed to form as a result of the collapse of the
lattice surrounding a cavity which has been produced
by the aggregation of vacancies on to a ⊿111/triangleleftplane.
As shown in Figure 4.32a, if the vacancies aggregate
on the central A-plane the adjoiningparts of the neigh-bouring B and C planes collapse to ﬁt in close-packed
formation. The Burgers vector of the dislocation linebounding the collapsed sheet is normal to the plane
with bD
a
3[111], where ais the lattice parameter, and
such a dislocation is sessile since it encloses an area
of stacking fault which cannot move with the dislo-
cation. A Frank sessile dislocation loop can also beproduced by inserting an extra layer of atoms between
two normal planesof atoms, as occurs when interstitial
atoms aggregate following high energy particle irradi-ation. For the loop formed from vacancies the stacking
sequence changes from the normal ABCABCA ...to
ABCBCA ..., whereas inserting a layer of atoms, e.g.
an A-layer between B and C, the sequence becomes
ABCABACA .... The former type of fault with one
violation in the stacking sequence is called an intrin-sic fault, the latter with two violations is called an
extrinsic fault. The stacking sequence violations are
conveniently shown by using the symbol 4to denote
any normal stacking sequence AB, BC, CA but5for
the reverse sequence AC, CB, BA . The normal fcc
stacking sequence is then given by 4444 ...,t h e
intrinsic fault by 44544 ...and the extrinsic fault
by445544 .... The reader may verify that the
faultdiscussedinthepreviousSectionisalsoanintrin-
sic fault, and that a series of intrinsic stacking faults
on neighbouring planes gives rise to a twinned struc-tureABCABACBA or444455554 . Elec-
tron micrographs of Frank sessile dislocation loops are
shown in Figures 4.38 and 4.39.
Another common obstacle is that formed between
extended dislocations on intersecting f111gslip
planes, as shown in Figure 4.32b. Here, thecombination of the leading partial dislocation lying in
the⊿111/triangleleftplane with that which lies in the ⊿
111/triangleleft
plane forms another partial dislocation, often referredto as a ‘stair-rod’ dislocation, at the junction of the
two stacking fault ribbons by the reaction

gular group of partial dislocations, which bounds the
wedge-shaped stacking fault ribbon lying in a h101i
direction, is obviously incapable of gliding and suchan obstacle, ﬁrst considered by Lomer and Cottrell,is known as a Lomer-Cottrell barrier. Such a barrierimpedes the motion of dislocations and leads to work-
hardening, as discussed in Chapter 7.
4.4.3.4 Stacking faults in ceramics
Some ceramic oxides may be described in terms of
fcc or cph packing of the oxygen anions with thecationsoccupyingthetetrahedraloroctahedralintersti-
tial sites, and these are more likely to contain stacking
faults. Sapphire, ˛-Al

4.5 Volume defects
4.5.1 Void formation and annealing
Defects which occupy a volume within the crystal
may take the form of voids, gas bubbles and cavities.
These defects may form by heat-treatment, irradia-
tion or deformation and their energy is derived largely
from the surface energy (1–3 J /m2). In some materi-
als with low stacking fault energy a special type of
three-dimensional defect is formed, namely the defect
tetrahedron. This consists of a tetrahedron made up
from stacking faults on the four f111gplanes joined
together by six low-energy stair-rod dislocations. Thisdefect is discussed more fully in Section 4.6.2.3.
The growth of the original vacancy cluster into
a three-dimensional aggregate, i.e. void, a collapsed
vacancy disc, i.e. dislocationloop,should,in principle,
depend on the relative surface to strain energy values
for the respective defects. The energy of a three-
dimensional void is mainly surface energy, whereas
that of a Frank loop is mainly strain energy at small
sizes. However, without a detailed knowledge of thesurface energy of small voids and the core-energy of
dislocations it is impossible to calculate, with any
degree of conﬁdence, the relative stability of these
clustered vacancy defects.
The clustering of vacancies to form voids has now
been observed in a number of metals with either
fcc or cph structure. In as-quenched specimens thevoidsarenotsphericalbutboundedbycrystallographic
faces (see Figure 4.58) and usually are about 50 nm
radius in size. In fcc metals they are octahedral in
shape with sides along h110i, sometimes truncated by
f100gplanes, and in cph metals bounded by prism
and pyramidal planes. Void formation is favoured by
slow quenching rates and high ageing temperatures,
and the density of voids increases when gas is present
in solid solution (e.g. hydrogen in copper, and eitherhydrogen or oxygen in silver). In aluminium and mag-
nesium, void formation is favoured by quenching from
a wet atmosphere, probably as a result of hydrogen
production due to the oxidation reactions. It has been
postulated that small clustered vacancy groups are sta-
bilized by the presence of gas atoms and prevented
from collapsing to a planar disc, so that some critical
size for collapse can be exceeded. The voids are not
conventional gas bubbles, however, since only a fewgas atoms are required to nucleate the void after which
it grows by vacancy adsorption.
4.5.2 Irradiation and voiding
Irradiation produces both interstitials and vacancies in
excess of the equilibrium concentration. Both species
initially cluster to form dislocation loops, but it is the
interstitial loops formed from clustering of interstitials
which eventually develop into a dislocation structure.
In general, interstitial loops grow during irradiation
because the large elastic misﬁt associated with an
interstitial causes dislocations to attract interstitialsmore strongly than vacancies. Interstitial loops are
therefore intrinsically stable defects, whereas vacancyloops are basically unstable defects during irradiation.
Thus interstitials attracted to a vacancy loop, i.e. a
loop formed by clustering vacancies, will cause it toshrinkastheinterstitialsare annihilated.Increasingthe
irradiationtemperatureresultsinvacanciesaggregating
to form voids. Voids are formed in an intermediatetemperature range ³0.3to0 .6T
m, abovethatfor long-
range single vacancy migration and below that for
thermal vacancy emission from voids. To create theexcess vacancy concentration it is also necessary to
buildupacriticaldislocationdensityfromloopgrowth
to bias the interstitial ﬂow.
There are two important factors contributing to void
formation. The ﬁrst is the degree of bias the disloca-
tion density (developed from the growth of interstitialloops) has for attracting interstitials, which suppressesthe interstitial content compared to vacancies. The
second factor is the important role played in void
nucleation by gases, both surface-active gases suchas oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen frequently present
as residual impurities, and inert gases such as helium
which may be generated continuously during irradia-tion due to transmutation reactions. The surface-active
gases such as oxygen in copper can migrate to embryo
vacancy clusters and reduce the surface energy. Theinert gas atoms can acquire vacancies to become gas
molecules inside voids(when the gas pressure is not in
equilibrium with the void surface tension) or gas bub-bles when the gas pressure is considerable ( P
/H113542/CRs/r).
Voids and bubbles can give rise to irradiation swelling
and embrittlement of materials.
4.5.3 Voiding and fracture
The formation of voids is an important feature in
the ductile failure of materials. The fracture process
involves three stages. First, small holes or cavitiesnucleate usually at weak internal interfaces (e.g. par-
ticle/matrix interfaces). These cavities then expand by
plastic deformation and ﬁnally coalesce by localizednecking of the metal between adjacent cavities to form
a ﬁbrous fracture. A scanning electron micrograph
showing the characteristics of a typical ductile failureis shown in Figure 4.35. This type of fracture may be
regarded as taking place by the nucleation of an inter-
nal plastic cavity, rather than a crack, which growsoutwards to meet the external neck which is growing
inwards. Experimental evidence suggests that nucle-
ation occurs at foreign particles. For example, OFHCcopper necks down to over 90% reduction in area,
whereas tough-pitchcopper shows only 70% reduction
in area; a similar behaviour is noted for super-pure andcommercial purity aluminium. Thus if no inclusions
were present, failure should occur by the specimen
pulling apart entirely by the inward growth of theexternal neck, giving nearly 100% reduction in area.
Dispersion-hardened materials in general fail with a
ductile fracture, the ﬁbrous region often consisting

4.6 Defect behaviour in some real
materials
4.6.1 Dislocation vector diagrams and the
Thompson tetrahedron
The classiﬁcation of defects into point, line, planar
and volume is somewhat restrictive in presenting anoverview of defect behaviour in materials, since it isclear,evenfromthediscussionsofar,thatthesedefects
are interrelated and interdependent. In the followingsections these features will be brought out as well as
those which relate to speciﬁc structures.
In dealing with dislocation interactions and defects
in real material it is often convenient to work with
a vector notation rather than use the more conven-
tional Miller indices notation. This may be illustrated
by reference to the fcc structure and the Thompson
tetrahedron.
All the dislocations common to the fcc structure,
discussed in the previous sections, can be represented
conveniently by means of the Thompson referencetetrahedron(Figure 4.36a), formed by joiningthethree
nearest face-centring atoms to the origin D. Here

ing fault arrangement; the Roman–Greek partial B υ

4.6.2 Dislocations and stacking faults in fcc
structures
4.6.2.1 Frank loops
A powerful illustration of the use of the Thompson
tetrahedron can be made if we look at simple Frank
loops in fcc metals (see Figure 4.32a). The Frank par-tial dislocation has a Burgers vector perpendicular to
the⊿111/triangleleftplane on which it lies and is represented
by A ˛,Bˇ,C/CR,Dυ,˛A, etc. Such loops shown in
the electron micrograph of Figure 4.38 have been pro-
duced in aluminium by quenching from about 600
°C.
Each loop arises from the clustering of vacancies into
a disc-shaped cavity which then form a dislocation
loop. To reduce their energy, the loops take up reg-ular crystallographic forms with their edges parallel to
theh110idirections in the loop plane. Along a h110i
direction it can reduce its energy by dissociating on
an intersecting f111gplane, forming a stair-rod at the
junction of the two f111gplanes, e.g. A ˛!AυCυ˛
when the Frank dislocation lies along [
101] common
to both ˛-a n d υ-planes.
Some of the loops shown in Figure 4.38 are not
Frank sessile dislocations as expected, but prismatic
dislocations, since no contrast of the type arising from
stacking faults, can be seen within the defects. Thefault will be removed by shear if it has a high stacking
fault energy thereby changing the sessile Frank loop
into a glissile prismatic loop according to the reaction
a/3[111] Ca/6[11
2]!a/2[110]
Stressing the foil while it is under observation in
the microscope allows the unfaulting process to be

and Smallman, 1965; courtesy of Taylor and Francis) .
observed directly (see Figure 4.39). This reaction is
more easily followed with the aid of the Thompsontetrahedron and rewritten as
DυCυC!DC
Physically, thismeans thatthe discof vacancies aggre-
g a t e do na ⊿111/triangleleftplane of a metal with high stack-
ing fault energy, besides collapsing, also undergoesa shear movement. The dislocation loops shown inFigure 4.39b are therefore unit dislocations with theirBurgers vector a/2[110] inclined at an angle to the
original ⊿111/triangleleftplane. A prismatic dislocation loop lies
on the surface of a cylinder, the cross-section of whichis determined by the dislocation loop, and the axis ofwhich is parallel to the [110] direction. Such a dislo-cation is not sessile, and under the action of a shearstress it is capable of movement by prismatic slip in
the [110] direction.
Many of the large Frank loops in Figure 4.38
(for example, marked A) contain additional triangular-shaped loop contrast within the outer hexagonal loop.

sessile dislocation by stress (after Goodhew and Smallman) .

The stacking fault fringes within the triangle are usu-
allydisplacedrelativetothosebetweenthetriangleandthe hexagon by half the fringe spacing, which is thecontrast expected from overlapping intrinsic stackingfaults. The structural arrangement of those double-faulted loops is shown schematically in Figure 4.40,from which it can be seen that two intrinsic faultson next neighbouring planes are equivalent to anextrinsicfault.Theobservationofdouble-faultedloopsin aluminium indicates that it is energetically morefavourable to nucleate a Frank sessile loop on an exist-ing intrinsic fault than randomly in the perfect lattice,and it therefore follows that the energy of a double orextrinsic fault is less than twice that of the intrinsicfault, i.e. /CR
E<2/CRI. The double loops marked B have
the outer intrinsic fault removed by stress.
The addition of a third overlapping intrinsic fault
would change the stacking sequence from the per-fectABCABCABC toABC #B#A#CABC,where
the arrows indicate missing planes of atoms, and pro-duce a coherent twinned structure with two coherenttwin boundaries. This structure would be energeticallyfavourable to form, since /CR
twin</CRI</CRE. It is pos-
sible, however, to reduce the energy of the crystaleven further by aggregating the third layer of vacan-cies between the two previously-formed neighbouringintrinsic faults to change the structure from an extrin-sically faulted ABC #B#ABCto perfect ABC ###
ABCstructure. Such a triple-layer dislocation loop is
shown in Figure 4.41.
4.6.2.2 Stair-rod dislocations
The stair-rod dislocation formed at the apex of aLomer-Cottrell barrier can also be represented by theThompson notation. As an example, let us take theinteraction between dislocations on the υ-a n d ˛-
planes.TwounitdislocationsBAandDB,respectively,are dissociated according to
BA!BυCυA⊿on the υ-plane /triangleleft
and DB !D˛C˛B⊿on the ˛-plane /triangleleft
and when the two Shockley partials ˛Ba n dB υinter-
act, a stair-rod dislocation ˛υDa/6[101] is formed.
This low-energy dislocation is pure edge and there-fore sessile. If the other pair of partials interact thenthe resultant Burgers vector is ⊿υACD˛/triangleleftDa/3[101]

and of higher energy. This vector is written in Thomp-
son’s notation as υD/A˛and is a vector equal to twice
the length joining the midpoints of υAa n dD ˛.
4.6.2.3 Stacking-fault tetrahedra
In fcc metals and alloys, the vacancies may also clus-
ter into a three-dimensional defect, forming a tetra-
hedral arrangement of stacking faults on the fourf111gplanes with the six h110iedges of the tetrahe-
dron, where the stacking faults bend from one f111g
plane to another, consisting of stair-rod dislocations.The crystal structure is perfect inside and outside thetetrahedron, and the three-dimensional array of faults
exhibits characteristic projected shape and contrast
when seen in transmission electron micrographs asshown in Figure 4.44. This defect was observed orig-
inally in quenched gold but occurs in other materials
withlowstacking-faultenergy.Onemechanismfortheformation of the defect tetrahedron by the dissociationof a Frank dislocation loop (see Figure 4.42) was ﬁrst
explained by Silcox and Hirsch. The Frank partial dis-
location bounding a stacking fault has, because of itslarge Burgers vector, a high strain energy, and hence
can lower its energy by dissociation according to a
reaction of the type
a/3[111]
/parenleftbig1
3/parenrightbig!a/6[121]/parenleftbig1
6/parenrightbigCa/6[101]/parenleftbig1
18/parenrightbig
The ﬁgures underneath the reaction represent the ener-
gies of the dislocations, since they are proportional tothe squares of the Burgers vectors. This reaction is,
therefore, energetically favourable. This reaction can
be seen with the aid of the Thompson tetrahedron,which shows that the Frank partial dislocation A˛can
dissociate into a Shockley partial dislocation ( Aˇ,Aυ
orA/CR) and a low energy stair-rod dislocation ( ˇ˛,υ˛
or/CR˛) for example A˛!A/CRC/CR˛.

Figure 4.42 Formation of defect tetrahedron: (a) dissociation of Frank dislocations. (b) formation of new stair-rod
dislocations, and (c) arrangement of the six stair-rod dislocations .
The formation of the defect tetrahedron of stacking
faults may be envisaged as follows. The collapse ofa vacancy disc will, in the ﬁrst instance, lead to theformation of a Frank sessile loop bounding a stackingfault, with edges parallel to the h110idirections.
Each side of the loop then dissociates according tothe above reaction into the appropriate stair-rod andpartial dislocations, and, as shown in Figure 4.42a, the
Shockley dislocations formed by dissociation will lie
on intersecting f111gplanes, above and below the
plane of the hexagonal loop; the decrease in energyaccompanying the dissociation will give rise to forceswhich tend to pull any rounded part of the loopintoh110i. Moreover, because the loop will not in
general be a regular hexagon, the short sides will beeliminated by the preferential addition of vacancies atthe constricted site, and a triangular-shaped loop willform (Figure 4.42b). The partials Aˇ,A/CRandAυbow
out on their slip plane as they are repelled by the stair-rods. Taking into account the fact that adjacent endsof the bowing loops are of opposite sign, the partialsattract each other in pairs to form stair-roddislocationsalong DA,BAandCA, according to the reactions
/CRACAˇ!/CRB,υ ACA/CR!υ/CR, ˇA CAυ!ˇυ
In vector notation the reactions are of the type
a/6[

(the reader may deduce the appropriate indices from
Figure 4.37), and from the addition of the squares oftheBurgers vectorsunderneathitisclear thatthisreac-tion is also energetically favourable. The ﬁnal defectwill therefore be a tetrahedron made up from the inter-section of stacking faults on the four f111gplanes, so
that the h110iedges of the tetrahedron will consist of
low-energy stair-rod dislocations (Figure 4.42c).
The tetrahedron of stacking faults formed by the
above sequence of events is essentially symmetrical,and the same conﬁguration would have been obtainedif collapse had taken place originally on any other⊿111/triangleleftplane. The energy of the system of stair-rod
dislocations in the ﬁnal conﬁguration is proportionalto 6ð

18D1
3, compared with 3 ð1
3D1 for the orig-
inal stacking fault triangle bounded by Frank partials.
Considering the dislocation energies alone, the disso-
ciation leads to a lowering of energy to one-third of
the original value. However, three additional stacking
fault areas, with energies of /CRper unit area, have been
newly created and if there is to be no net rise in energy
these areas will impose an upper limit on the size of
the tetrahedron formed. The student may wish to ver-
ify that a calculation of this maximum size shows the
side of the tetrahedron should be around 50 nm.
De Jong and Koehler have proposed that the tetra-
hedra may also form by the nucleation and growth
of a three-dimensional vacancy cluster. The smallestcluster that is able to collapse to a tetrahedron and
subsequently grow by the absorption of vacancies is a
hexa-vacancy cluster. Growth would then occur by the
nucleationandpropagationofjoglinesacrossthefaces
of the tetrahedron, as shown in Figure 4.43. The hexa-vacancy cluster may form by clustering di-vacancies
and is aided by impurities which have excess positive
change relative to the matrix (e.g. Mg, Cd or Al inAu). Hydrogen in solution is also a potent nucleating
agentbecausethedi-vacancy/protoncomplexismobile
and attracted to ‘free’ di-vacancies. Figure 4.44 shows
the increase in tetrahedra nucleation after preannealing
gold in hydrogen.

the vector has a component along the c-axis, as for
example ha/3,a /3,2⊿a/3/triangleleft,3ci,d i fﬁculty arises and
to avoid confusion the vectors are referred to unitdistances ⊿ a ,a ,a ,c /triangleleft along the respective axes (e.g.

be represented in a notation similar to that for the fccstructure, but using a double-tetrahedron or bipyramidinstead of the single tetrahedron previously adopted,as shown in Figure 4.45. An examination leads to the
following simple types of dislocation:
1. Six perfect dislocations with Burgers vectors in the
basal plane along the sides of the triangular baseABC. They are AB, BC, CA, BA, CB and AC and
are denoted by aor 1/3h11

2. Six partial dislocations with Burgers vectors in the
basal plane represented by the vectors A /ESC,B/ESC,C/ESC
and their negatives. These dislocations arise fromdissociation reactions of the type

and may also be written as por

Thereare many similaritiesbetweenthedislocations
in the cph and fcc structure and thus it is not necessary
to discuss them in great detail. It is, however, of
interest to consider the two basic processes of glideand climb.
4.6.3.1 Dislocation glide
A perfect slip dislocation in the basal plane AB D

3[1210] may dissociate into two Shockley partial
dislocations separating a ribbon of intrinsic stacking
fault which violates the two next-nearest neighbours in
the stacking sequence. There are actually two possibleslip sequences: either a B-layer slides over an A-layer,i.e. A /ESCfollowed by /ESCB (see Figure 4.46a) or an A-
layer slides over a B-layer by the passage of a /ESCB
partial followed by an A /ESC(see Figure 4.46b). The
dissociation given by
AB!A/ESCC/ESCB
may be written in Miller –Bravais indices as
1
3[1210]!1
3[0110]C1
3[1100]This reaction is similar to that in the fcc lattice and
the width of the ribbon is again inversely proportionalto the stacking fault energy /CR. Dislocations dissociated
inthebasalplaneshavebeenobservedincobalt,which
undergoes a phase transformation and for which /CR
is considered to be low ⊿³25 mJ/m2/triangleleft. For the other
common cph metals Zn, Cd, Mg, Ti, Be, etc. /CRis
high⊿250–300 mJ/m2/triangleleft. No measurements of intrinsic
faults with two next-nearest neighbour violations havebeen made, but intrinsic faults with one next-nearest
neighbour violation have been measured and show
that Mg ³125 mJ/m2,Z n³140 mJ/m2,a n dC d ³
150–175 mJ/m2. It is thus reasonable to conclude
that intrinsic faults associated with Shockley partialshave somewhat higher energy. Dislocations in these
metals are therefore not very widely dissociated. A
screw dislocation lying along a [
1210] direction is
capable of gliding in three different glide planes butthe small extension in the basal plane will be suf ﬁcient
to make basal glide easier than in either the pyramidal
⊿10
11/triangleleftor prismatic ⊿1010/triangleleftglide (see Figure 7.19).
Pyramidal and prismatic glide will be more favouredat high temperatures in metals with high stacking-faultenergy when thermal activation aids the constrictionof the dissociated dislocations.
4.6.3.2 Dislocation climb
Stacking faults may be produced in hexagonal latticesby the aggregation of point defects. If vacancies

the resultant collapse of the disc-shaped cavity
(Figure 4.46d) would bring two similar layers intocontact.Thisisasituationincompatiblewiththeclose-packing and suggests that simple Frank dislocationsare energetically unfavourable in cph lattices. Thisunfavourable situation can be removed by either oneof two mechanisms as shown in Figures 4.46e and4.46f. In Figure 4.46e the B-layer is converted to aC-position by passing a pair of equal and oppositepartial dislocations (dipole) over adjacent slip planes.The Burgers vector of the dislocation loop will beof the /ESCS type and the energy of the fault, which is
extrinsic, willbe highbecause of the three next nearest
neighbour violations. In Figure 4.46f the loop is sweptby a A /ESC-type partial dislocation which changes the
stacking of all the layers above the loop accordingto the rule A !B!C!A. The Burgers vector of
the loop is of the type AS, and from the dislocation

All these faulted dislocation loops are capable of
climbing by the addition or removal of point defectsto the dislocation line. The shrinkage and growth ofvacancy loops has been studied in some detail in Zn,Mg and Cd and examples, together with the climbanalysis, are discussed in Section 4.7.1.
4.6.4 Dislocations and stacking faults in bcc
structures
The shortest lattice vector in the bcc lattice is
a/2[111], which joins an atom at a cube corner to the
one at the centre of the cube; this is the observed slipdirection. The slip plane most commonly observed is⊿110 /triangleleftwhich, as shown in Figure 4.50, has a distorted
close-packed structure. The ⊿110 /triangleleftplanes are packed

Weertman; by courtesy of Collier-Macmillan International) .
in anABABAB sequence and three f110gtype planes
intersect along a h111idirection. It therefore follows
that screw dislocations are capable of moving in anyof the three f110gplanes and for this reason the slip
lines are often wavy and ill-deﬁned. By analogy with
the fcc structure it is seen that in moving the B-layer
along the [
111] direction it is easier to shear in the
directions indicated by the three vectors b1,b2and
b3. These three vectors deﬁne a possible dissociation
reaction
a

8[110]Ca
4[112]Ca
8[110]
The stacking fault energy of pure bcc metals is con-
sidered to be very high, however, and hence no faults
have been observed directly. Because of the stackingsequence ABABAB of the ⊿110 /triangleleftplanes the formation
of a Frank partial dislocation in the bcc structure givesrise to a situation similar to that for the cph structure,i.e. the aggregation of vacancies or interstitials willbring either two A-layers or two B-layers into contact
with each other. The correct stacking sequence can
be restored by shearing the planes to produce perfect
dislocations a/2[111] or a/2[11
1].
Slip has also been observed on planes indexed as
⊿112 /triangleleftand ⊿123 /triangleleftplanes, and although some workers
attribute this latter observation to varying amounts ofslip on different ⊿110 /triangleleftplanes, there is evidence to
indicate that ⊿112 /triangleleftand ⊿123 /triangleleftare deﬁnite slip planes.
The packing of atoms in a ⊿112 /triangleleftplane conforms to a
rectangular pattern, the rows and columns parallel to
the [1
10]and[11 1] directions, respectively, with the
closest distance of approach along the [11 1] direc-
tion. The stacking sequence of the ⊿112 /triangleleftplanes is
ABCDEFAB ...and the spacing between the planes

because the homogeneous shear necessary to twin the
structure is 1 /p
2i na h111ion a ⊿112 /triangleleftand this
shear can be produced by a displacement a/6[111] on
every successive ⊿112 /triangleleftplane. It is therefore believed
that twinning takes place by the movement of partial
dislocations. However, it is generally recognized that
the stacking fault energy is very high in bcc metals so
that dissociation must be limited. Moreover, because
the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations are
parallel, it is not possible to separate the partials by
an applied stress unless one of them is anchored by
some obstacle in the crystal.

sion and compression. A yield stress asymmetry has

4.6.5 Dislocations and stacking faults in
ordered structures
When the alloy orders, a unit dislocation in a disor-
dered alloy becomes a partial-dislocation in the super-
lattice with its attached anti-phase boundary interface,
as shown in Figure 4.52a. Thus, when this dislocationmoves through the lattice it will completely destroythe order across its slip plane. However, in an orderedalloy, any given atom prefers to have unlike atoms as

its neighbours, and consequently such a process of slip
wouldrequireaveryhighstress.Tomoveadislocation
against the force /CRexerted on it by the fault requires
a shear stress /FSD/CR/b,w h e r e bis the Burgers vec-
tor; in ˇ-brass where /CRis about 0.07 N/m this stress
is 300 MN/m2. In practice the critical shear stress of
ˇ-brass is an order of magnitude less than this value,
and thus one must conclude that slip occurs by aneasier process than the movement of unit dislocations.
In consequence, by analogy with the slip process in
fcc crystals, where the leading partial dislocation of
an extended dislocation trails a stacking fault, it is
believed that the dislocations which cause slip in anordered lattice are not single dislocations but coupled
pairs of dislocations, as shown in Figure 4.52b. The
ﬁrst dislocation of the pair, on moving across the slipplane, destroys the order and the second half of the
couple completely restores it again, the third disloca-
tion destroys it once more, and so on. In ˇ-brass

the crystal structure is ordered bcc (or CsCl-type) and,consequently, deformation is believed to occur by the

When disordered, the slip vector is a/2[111], but this
vector in the ordered structure moves an A atom to a B site.

tions. The combined slip vector of the coupled pair of
dislocations, sometimes called a super-dislocation, is
then equivalent to a[111], and, since this vector con-
nects like atoms in the structure, long-range order willbe maintained.
The separation of the super-partial dislocations may
be calculated, as for Shockley partials, by equating the
repulsiveforcebetweenthetwolike a/2h111idisloca-
tions to the surface tension of the anti-phase boundary.The values obtained for ˇ-brass and FeCo are about 70
and 50 nm, respectively, and thus super-dislocations
can be detected in the electron microscope using theweak beam technique (see Chapter 5). The separationis inversely proportional to the square of the orderingparameter and super-dislocation pairs ³12.5 nm width

In alloys with high ordering energies the antiphase
boundaries associated with super-dislocations cannot
be tolerated and dislocations with a Burgers vector
equal to the unit lattice vector ah100ioperate to pro-
duce slip in h100idirections. The extreme case of this
is in ionic-bonded crystals such as CsBr, but strongly-ordered intermetallic compounds such as NiAl are also
observed to slip in the h100idirection with disloca-
tions having bDah100i.

dislocations. Figure 4.53a illustrates three ⊿111 /triangleleft

layers of the Ll 2structure, with different size atoms
for each layer. The three vectors shown give rise
to the formation of different planar faults; a/2[101]
is a super-partial producing apb, a/6[211] produces
the familiar stacking fault, and a/3[112] produces a
super-lattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF). A [ 101]

sociate, as for fcc, according to

The resultant super-dislocation is schematically
shown in Figure 4.53b. In alloys such as Cu 3Au,
Ni3Mn, Ni 3Al, etc., the stacking fault ribbon is
too small to be observed experimentally but super-
dislocations have been observed. It is evident,
however, that the cross-slip of these super-dislocationswill be an extremely difﬁcult process. This can lead to
ahighwork-hardeningrateinthesealloys,asdiscussed
in Chapter 7.
In an alloy possessing short-range order, slip will
not occur by the motion of super-dislocations sincetherearenolong-rangefaultstocouplethedislocationstogether in pairs. However, because the distribution
of neighbouring atoms is not random the passage
of a dislocation will destroy the short-range orderbetween the atoms, across the slip plane. As before,the stress to do this will be large but in this case thereis no mechanism, such as coupling two dislocations
together, to make the process easier. The fact that,
for instance, a crystal of AuCu
3in the quenched
state (short-range order) has nearly double the yieldstrength of the annealed state (long-range order) maybe explained on this basis. The maximum strength is
exhibited by a partially-ordered alloy with a critical
domain size of about 6 nm. The transition fromdeformation by unitdislocationsin the disorderedstateto deformation by super-dislocations in the orderedcondition gives rise to a peak in the ﬂow stress with
change in degree of order (see Chapter 6).
4.6.6 Dislocations and stacking faults in
ceramics
At room temperature, the primary slip system in the
fcc structure of magnesia, MgO, is f110gh110i.I t
is favoured because its Burgers vector is short and,most importantly, because this vector is parallel torows of ions of like electrostatic charge, permitting
the applied stress to shear the f110gplanes past each
other. Slip in the h100idirections is resisted at room
temperature because it involves forcing ions of likecharge into close proximity. If we consider the slipgeometry of ionic crystals in terms of the Thompson
tetrahedron for cubic ionic crystals (Figure 4.54), six
Figure 4.54 Thompson tetrahedron for ionic crystals (cubic) .
116Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
primary f110gslip planes extend from the central
point O of the tetrahedron to its h110iedges. There is
no dissociation in the f111gfaces and slip is only
possible along the h110iedges of the tetrahedron.
Thus, for each of the f110gplanes, there is only one
h110idirection available. This limiting ‘one-to-one’
relation for a cubic ionic crystal contrasts with the‘three-to-one’ relation of the f111gh110islip system
incubicmetalliccrystals.Asanalternativetothedirect
‘easy’ translation/NUL!AC, we might postulate the route
/NUL!ABC/NUL!BC at room temperature. This process involves
sliponplaneOABinthedirection/NUL!ABfollowedbyslip
on plane OCB in the direction/NUL!BC. It is not favoured
because, apart from being unfavoured in terms ofenergy, it involves a 60
°change in slip direction and
the critical resolved shear stress for the second stage islikely to be much greater than that needed to activatethe ﬁrst set of planes. The two-stage route is thereforea difﬁcult one. Finally, it will be noticed that thecentralpointliesatthejunctionofthe h111idirections
which, being in a cubic system, are perpendicular tothe four f111gfaces. One can thus appreciate why
raising the temperature of an ionic crystal often allowsthef110gh111isystem to become active.
In a single crystal of alumina, which is
rhombohedral-hexagonal in structure and highlyanisotropic, slip is conﬁned to the basal planes.At temperatures above 900
°C, the slip system is
f0001gh1120i. As seen from Figure 2.18, this
resultant slip direction is not one of close-packing.If a unit translation of shear is to take place inah11
20i-type direction, the movement and re-
registration of oxygen anions and aluminium cations
must be in synchronism (‘synchro-shear’). Figure 4.55
shows the Burgers vectors for slip in the [11 20]
direction in terms of the two modes of dissociation
proposed by M. Kronberg. These two routes are
energetically favoured. The dissociation reaction
for the oxygen anions is:1
3[1120]!1
3[1010]C

3[0110]. The vectors for these two half-partials lie in
close-packed directions and enclose a stacking fault.
In the case of the smaller aluminium cations, furtherdissociation of each of similar half-partials takes
place (e.g.

both types of planar fault (single and triple) across the
basal planes.
4.6.7 Defects in crystalline polymers
Crystalline regions in polymers are based upon long-chain molecules and are usually associated with atleast some glassy (amorphous) regions. Although
less intensively studied than defect structures in
metals and ceramics, similar crystal defects, such
as vacancies, interstitials and dislocations, have been
observed in polymers. Their association with linearmacromolecules, however, introduces certain special
features. For instance, the chain ends of molecules
can be regarded as point defects because they differ inchemical character from the chain proper. Vacancies,
usually associated with chain ends, and foreign atoms,
acting as interstitials, are also present. Edge and

Defects in solids 117
screw dislocations have been detected.1Moir´e pattern
techniques of electron microscopy are useful forrevealing the presence of edge dislocations. Growth
spirals, centred on screw dislocations, have frequently
been observed on surfaces of crystalline polymers,with the Burgers vector, dislocation axis and chain
directionslyinginparalleldirections(e.g.polyethylene
crystals grown from a concentrated melt).
Within crystalline regions, such as spherulites com-
posedoffoldedchainmolecules, discrepanciesinfold-
ing may be regarded as defects. The nature of thetwo-dimensional surface at the faces of spherulites
where chains emerge, fold and re-enter the crystalline
region is of particular interest. Similarly, the surfaceswhere spherulite edges impinge upon each other can
be regarded as planar defects, being analogous to grain
boundary surfaces.
X-ray diffraction studies of line-broadening effects
and transmission electron microscopy have been used
to elucidate crystal defects in polymers. In the latter
case, the high energy of an electron beam can damagethe polymer crystals and introduce artefacts. It is
recognized that the special structural features found
in polymer crystals such as the comparative thinnessof many crystals, chain-folding, the tendency of the
molecules to resist bending of bonds and the great
difference between primary intramolecular bondingand secondary intermolecular bonding, make them
unique and very different to metallic and ceramic
crystals.
4.6.8 Defects in glasses
Itisrecognizedthatrealglassstructuresarelesshomo-geneous than the random network model might sug-
gest. Adjacent glassy regions can differ abruptly in
composition,givingriseto‘cords’,andithasbeenpro-posed that extremely small micro-crystalline regionsmay exist within the glass matrix. Tinting of clear
glass is evidence for the presence of trace amounts of
impurity atoms (iron, chromium) dispersed throughoutthe structure. Modifying ions of sodium are relatively
loosely held in the interstices and have been known to
migrate through the structure and aggregate close tofree surfaces. On a coarser scale, it is possible for bub-
bles (‘seeds’), rounded by surface tension, to persist
from melting/ﬁning operations. Bubbles may containgases, such as carbon dioxide, sulphurdioxide and sul-
phur trioxide. Solid inclusions (‘stones’) of crystalline
matter, such as silica, alumina and silicates, may bepresent in the glass as a result of incomplete fusion,

compound platinum phthalocyanine which has relativelylarge intermolecular spacing provided the ﬁrst visualevidence for the existence of edge dislocations.4.7 Stability of defects
4.7.1 Dislocation loops
During annealing, defects such as dislocation loops,
stacking-fault tetrahedra and voids may exhibit
shrinkage in size. This may be strikingly demonstrated
by observing a heated specimen in the microscope. On
heating, the dislocation loops and voids act as vacancy
sources and shrink, and hence the defects annihilate
themselves. This process occurs in the temperature
range where self-diffusion is rapid, and conﬁrms that
the removal of the residual resistivity associated with
Stage II is due to the dispersal of the loops, voids, etc.
Thedrivingforcefortheemissionofvacanciesfrom
a vacancy defect arises in the case of (1) a prismatic
loop from the line tension of the dislocation, (2) a
Frank loop from the force due to the stacking fault
on the dislocation line since in intermediate and high
/CR-metals this force far outweighs the line tension con-
tribution, and (3) a void from the surface energy /CRs.
The annealing of Frank loops and voids in quenched
aluminium is shown in Figures 4.56 and 4.58, respec-
tively. In a thin metal foil the rate of annealing is
generally controlled by the rate of diffusion of vacan-
cies away from the defect to any nearby sinks, usually
the foil surfaces, rather than the emission of vacan-
cies at the defect itself. To derive the rate equation
governing the annealing, the vacancy concentrationat the surface of the defect is used as one bound-
ary condition of a diffusion-controlled problem and
the second boundary condition is obtained by assum-
ing that the surfaces of a thin foil act as ideal sinks
for vacancies. The rate then depends on the vacancy
concentration gradient developed between the defect,
where the vacancy concentration is given by

with ⊿dF/dn/triangleleftthe change of free energy of the defect

and obeys an r2versus trelationship.

difﬁculty may be eliminated, however, by a compar-
ative method in which the annealing rate of a faulted
loop is compared to that of a prismatic one at the
same temperature. The intrinsic stacking fault energy
Defects in solids 119
of aluminium has been shown to be 135 mJ/m2by this
technique.
In addition to prismatic and single-faulted (Frank)
dislocation loops, double-faulted loops have also been
annealed in a number of quenched fcc metals. It is
observed that on annealing, the intrinsic loop ﬁrst
shrinks until it meets the inner, extrinsically-faultedregion, following which the two loops shrink togetheras one extrinsically-faulted loop. The rate of annealingof this extrinsic fault may be derived in a way similar
to equation (4.15) and is given by

Loop growth can occur when the direction of the
vacancyﬂux istowards thelooprather than away from
it, as in the case of loop shrinkage. This conditioncan arise when the foil surface becomes a vacancy
source, as, for example, during the growth of a surface
oxideﬁlm. Loop growth is thus commonly found in
Zn, Mg, Cd, although loop shrinkage is occasionallyobserved, presumably due to the formation of localcracks in the oxide ﬁlm at which vacancies can be
annihilated. Figure 4.47 shows loops growing in Mg
as a result of the vacancy supersaturation produced by
oxidation. For the double loops, it is observed that astacking fault is created by vacancy absorption at thegrowing outer perimeter of the loop and is destroyedat the growing inner perfect loop. The perfect regionsexpand faster than the outer stacking fault, since the
addition of a vacancy to the inner loop decreases the
energy of the defect by /CRB
2whereas the addition of a
vacancy to the outer loop increases the energy by the
same amount. This effect is further enhanced as the
two loops approach each other due to vacancy transferfrom the outer to inner loops. Eventually the two loopscoalesce to give a perfect prismatic loop of Burgersvector cD[0001] which continues to grow under the
vacancy supersaturation. The outer loop growth rate is
thus given by

4.7.2 Voids
Voids will sinter on annealing at a temperature where
self-diffusion is appreciable. The driving force for
sintering arises from the reduction in surface energyas the emission of vacancies takes place from thevoid surface. In a thin metal foil the rate of annealingis generally controlled by the rate of diffusion of
vacancies away from the defect to any nearby sinks,
usually the foil surfaces. The rate then depends on thevacancy concentration gradient developed between thedefect (where the vacancy concentration is given by

with ⊿dF/dn/triangleleftthe change in free energy of the defect

on aﬁner scale than in quenched metals, because
of the high supersaturation and low diffusion dis-
tance. Bombardment of copper foils with 1 .4ð1021
38 MeV ˛-particles m/NUL2produces about 1021m/NUL3dis-
location loops as shown in Figure 4.59a; a denudedregion 0 .8

boundary. These loops, about 40 nm diameter, indi-
cate thatanatomic concentrationof ³1.5ð10/NUL4point
defects have precipitated in this form. Heavier dosesof˛-particle bombardment produce larger diameterloops, which eventually appear as dislocation tangles.
Neutron bombardment produces similar effects to ˛-
particle bombardment, but unless the dose is greater
than10
21neutrons/m2theloopsaredif ﬁculttoresolve.
In copper irradiated at pile temperature the density
of loops increases with dose and can be as high as
1014m/NUL2in heavily bombarded metals.
The micrographs from irradiated metals reveal, in
addition to the dislocation loops, numerous small cen-
tres of strain in the form of black dots somewhat lessthan 5 nm diameter, which are dif ﬁcult to resolve (see
Figure 4.59a). Because the two kinds of clusters differ
in size and distribution, and also in their behaviour onannealing, it is reasonable to attribute the presence of
one type of defect, i.e. the large loops, to the aggrega-
tion of interstitials and the other, i.e. the small dots, tothe aggregation of vacancies. This general conclusion
has been con ﬁrmed by detailed contrast analysis of the
defects.
The addition of an extra ⊿111/triangleleftplane in a crys-
tal with fcc structure (see Figure 4.60) introduces two
faults in the stacking sequence and not one, as is the
case when a plane of atoms is removed. In conse-
quence, to eliminate the fault it is necessary for twopartial dislocations to slip across the loop, one above
the layer and one below, according to a reaction of
the form
a

6[112]Ca
6[121]!a

The resultant dislocation loop formed is identical
to the prismatic loop produced by a vacancy cluster
but has a Burgers vector of opposite sign. The size
of the loops formed from interstitials increases withthe irradiation dose and temperature, which suggests
that small interstitial clusters initially form and sub-
sequently grow by a diffusion process. In contrast,the vacancy clusters are much more numerous, and
although their size increases slightly with dose, their
number is approximately proportional to the dose andequal to the number of primary collisionswhich occur.
This observation supports the suggestion that vacancy
clusters are formed by the redistribution of vacanciescreated in the cascade.
Changing the type of irradiation from electron, to
light charged particles such as protons, to heavy ionssuch as self-ions, to neutrons, results in a progres-
sive increase in the mean recoil energy. This results
in an increasingly non-uniform point defect generationdue to the production of displacement cascades by pri-
mary knock-ons. During the creation of cascades, the
interstitials are transported outwards (see Figure 4.7),
most probably by focused collision sequences, i.e.
along a close-packed row of atoms by a sequence ofreplacement collisions, to displace the last atom in this
samecrystallographicdirection,leavingavacancy-rich
region at the centre of the cascade which can collapseto form vacancy loops. As the irradiation tempera-
ture increases, vacancies can also aggregate to form
voids.

Frank sessile dislocation loops, double-faulted
loops, tetrahedra and voids have all been observed
in irradiated metals, but usually under different
irradiation conditions. Results from Cu, Ag and Aushow that cascades collapse to form Frank loops, some
of which dissociate towards stacking fault tetrahedra.
The fraction of cascades collapsing to form visible
loops, deﬁned as the defect yield, is high, ³0.5i n
Cu to 1.0 in Au irradiated with self-ions. Moreover,the fraction of vacancies taking part in the collapse
process, expressed as the cascade efﬁciency, is also
high ( ³0.3 to 0.5). Vacancy loops have been observed
on irradiation at R.T. in some bcc metals (e.g. Mo,
Nb, W, ˛-Fe). Generally, the loops are perfect with
bDa/2h111ialthough they are thought to nucleate
asa/2h110ifaulted loops on f110gbut unfault at an
early stage because of the high stacking-fault energy.
Vacancy loops have also been observed in some cph
metals (e.g. Zr and Ti).Interstitial defects in the form of loops are
commonly observed in all metals. In fcc metals Frankloops containing extrinsic faults occur in Cu, Ag, Au,
Ni, Al and austenitic steels. Clustering of interstitials
on two neighbouring ⊿111/triangleleftplanes to produce an
intrinsically faulted defect may also occur, as shown
in Figure 4.60. In bcc metals they are predominantlyperfect a/2h111i.

formed on electron irradiation indicates that cascades
are not essential for the formation of vacancy loops.
Several factors can give rise to the increased stability
ofvacancyloopsinthesemetals. Onefactoristhepos-sibilityofstressesarisingfromoxidationoranisotropic
thermal expansion, i.e. interstitial loops are favoured
perpendicular to a tensile axis and vacancy loops par-
allel. A second possibility is impurities segregating to
dislocations and reducing the interstitial bias.
4.7.3.2 Radiation growth and swelling
In non-cubic materials, partitioning of the loops on
to speciﬁc habit planes can lead to an anisotropic
dimensional change, known as irradiation growth. Theaggregation of vacancies into a disc-shaped cavity
which collapses to form a dislocation loop will give
rise to a contraction of the material in the direction of
the Burgers vector. Conversely, the precipitation of a
plane of interstitials will result in the growth of the
material. Such behaviour could account for the growth
which takes place in ˛-uranium single crystals during
122Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
neutron irradiation, since electron micrographs from
thin ﬁlms of irradiated uranium show the presence of
clusters of point defects.
The energy of a ﬁssion fragment is extremely high
⊿³200 MeV /triangleleftso that a high concentration of both
vacancies and interstitials might be expected. A dose
of 1024nm/NUL2at room temperature causes uranium to
grow about 30% in the [010] direction and contractin the [100] direction. However, a similar dose at
the temperature of liquid nitrogen produces ten times
this growth, which suggests the preservation of about
10
4interstitials in clusters for each ﬁssion event that
occurs. Growth also occurs in textured polycrystalline
˛-uranium and to avoid the problem a random texture
has to be produced during fabrication. Similar effectscan be produced in graphite.
During irradiation vacancies may aggregate to form
voids and the interstitials form dislocation loops. The
voids can grow by acquiring vacancies which can beprovided by the climb of the dislocation loops. How-ever, because these loops are formed from interstitialatoms they grow, not shrink, during the climb processand eventually become a tangled dislocation network.
Interstitial point defects have two properties
important in both interstitial loop and void growth.First, the elastic size interaction(see Chapter 7) causesdislocations to attract interstitials more strongly thanvacancies and secondly, the formation energy of an
interstitial E

so that the dominant process at elevated temperatures
is vacancy emission. The importance of these factors

At low temperatures, voids undergo bias-driven
growth in the presence of biased sinks, i.e. dislocationloops or network of density /SUB. At higher tempera-
tures when the thermal emission of vacancies becomesimportant, whether voids grow or shrink depends onthe sign of [ ⊿2/CR

when gas is being created continuously the gas pres-
sureP>2/CRs/rand a ﬂux of gas atoms can arrive at

The formation of voids leads to the phenomenon
of void swelling and is of practical importance in
the dimensional stability of reactor core components.
The curves of Figure 4.61 show the variation in total
void volume as a function of temperature for solution-
treated Type 316 stainless steel; the upper cut-off
arises when the thermal vacancy emission from the
voids exceeds the net ﬂow into them. Comparing the
ion- and electron-irradiated curves shows that increas-
ing the recoil energy moves the lower threshold to
higher temperatures and is considered to arise from
the removal of vacancies by the formation of vacancy
loops in cascades; cascades are not created by electron
irradiation.
Voids are formed in an intermediate temperature
range ³0.3t o0 .6Tm, above that for long-range single
vacancy migration and below that for thermal vacancy
emission from voids. To create the excess vacancy
concentration it is also necessary to build up a critical
dislocation density from loop growth to bias theinterstitial ﬂow. The sink strength of the dislocations,
i.e. the effectiveness of annihilating point defects, is
given by K

law, which is consistentwith dislocationstructure con-
tinuing to evolve over the dose and temperature rangeexamined.
In the fuel element itself, ﬁssion gas swelling can
occur since uranium produces one atom of gas (Kr
and Ze) for every ﬁve U atoms destroyed. This leads
to³2m
3of gas (stp) per m3of U after a ‘burnup’ of
only 0.3% of the U atoms.
In practice, it is necessary to keep the swelling
small and also to prevent nucleation at grain bound-aries when embrittlement can result. In general,variables which can affect void swelling include alloy-
ing elements together with speciﬁc impurities, and
microstructural features such as precipitates, grain sizeand dislocation density. In ferritic steels, the intersti-tial solutes carbon and nitrogen are particularly effec-tivein(1) trappingtheradiation-inducedvacanciesand
therebyenhancingrecombinationwithinterstitials,and
(2) interacting strongly with dislocations and thereforereducing the dislocation bias for preferential annihila-tion of interstitials, and also inhibiting the climb rate
of dislocations. Substitutional alloying elements with
a positive misﬁt such as Cr, V and Mn with an afﬁnityfor C or N can interact with dislocations in combi-nation with interstitials and are considered to have a
greater inﬂuence than C and N alone.
These mechanisms can operate in fcc alloys with
speciﬁc solute atoms trapping vacancies and also elas-tically interacting with dislocations. Indeed the inhibi-
tion of climb has been advanced to explain the low
swelling of Nimonic PE16 nickel-based alloys. In this
case precipitateswere consideredtorestrictdislocationclimb. Such a mechanism of dislocation pinning islikely to be less effective than solute atoms since pin-
ning will only occur at intervals along the dislocation
line. Precipitates in the matrix which are coherent in
nature can also aid swelling resistance by acting as
regions of enhanced vacancy–interstitial recombina-tion. TEM observations on /DC2
0precipitates in Al–Cu
alloys have conﬁrmed that as these precipitates lose
coherency during irradiation, the swelling resistance
decreases.
4.7.3.3 Radiation-induced segregation, diffusion
and precipitation
Radiation-inducedsegregation isthe segregation under
irradiation of different chemical species in an alloy
towards or away from defect sinks (free surfaces,
grain boundaries, dislocations, etc.). The segregationis caused by the coupling of the different types of
atom with the defect ﬂuxes towards the sinks. There
are four different possible mechanisms, which fall intotwo pairs, one pair connected with size effects and the
other with the Kirkendall effect.
1With size effects,
the point defects drag the solute atoms to the sinks
because the size of the solute atoms differs from theothertypesofatompresent(solventatoms).Thusinter-
stitials drag small solute atoms to sinks and vacan-
cies drag large solute atoms to sinks. With Kirkendall
effects, the faster diffusing species move in the oppo-
site direction to the vacancy current, but in the samedirection as the interstitial current. The former case is
usually called the ‘inverse Kirkendall effect’, although
it is still the Kirkendall effect, but solute atoms ratherthan the vacancies are of interest. The most impor-
tant of these mechanisms, which are summarized in
Figure 4.62, appear to be (1) the interstitial size effect
mechanism–the dragging of small solute atoms to
sinks by interstitials–and (2) the vacancy Kirkendall
1The Kirkendall effect is discussed in Chapter 6,
Section 6.4.2.

effect–the migration away from sinks of fast-diffusing
atoms.
Radiation-induced segregation is technologically
important in fast breeder reactors, where the high
radiation levels and high temperatures cause large
effects.Thus,forexample,inType 316stainlesssteels,
at temperatures in the range 350–650 °C (depending
on the position in the reactor) silicon and nickel
segregate strongly to sinks. The small silicon atoms
are dragged there byinterstitialsand the slowdiffusing
nickel stays there in increasing concentration as the
other elements diffuse away by the vacancy inverse
Kirkendall effect. Such diffusion (1) denudes the
matrix of void-inhibiting silicon and (2) can cause
precipitation of brittle phases at grain boundaries, etc.
Diffusion rates may be raised by several orders of
magnitude because of the increased concentration of
point defects under irradiation. Thus phases expected
from phase diagrams may appear at temperatures
where kinetics are far too slow under normal
circumstances. Many precipitates of this type have
been seen in stainless steels which have been in
reactors. Two totally new phases have deﬁnitely been
produced and identiﬁed in alloy systems (e.g. Pd 8W
and Pd 8V) and others appear likely (e.g. Cu–Ni
miscibility gap).
This effect relates to the appearance of precipitates
after irradiation and possibly arises from the two
effects described above, i.e. segregation or enhanced
diffusion. It is possible to distinguish between
these two causes by post-irradiation annealing,
when the segregation-induced precipitates disappear
but the diffusion-induced precipitates remain, being
equilibrium phases.
4.7.3.4 Irradiation of ordering alloys
Orderingalloyshaveaparticularlyinterestingresponseto the inﬂuence of point defects in excess ofthe eqilibrium concentration. Irradiation introduces
point defects and their effect on the behaviour ofordered alloys depends on two competitive processes,i.e. radiation-induced ordering and radiation-induceddisordering, which can occur simultaneously. Theinterstitials do not contribute signiﬁcantly to orderingbut the radiation-induced vacancies give rise toordering by migrating through the crystal. Disorderingis assumed to take place athermally by displacements.Figure 4.63 shows the inﬂuence of electron irradiationtime and temperature on (a) initially ordered and(b) initially disordered Cu
3Au. The ﬁnal state of the
alloy at any irradiation temperature is independent ofthe initial condition. At 323 K, Cu
3Au is fully ordered
on irradiation, whether it is initially ordered or not,but at low temperatures it becomes largely disorderedbecause of the inability of the vacancies to migrate
and develop order; the interstitials ⊿E

migrate at low temperatures.

The characterization of materials
5.1 Tools of characterization
Determination of the structural character of a
material, whether massive in form or particulate,crystalline or glassy, is a central activity of
materials science. The general approach adopted
in most techniques is to probe the material witha beam of radiation or high-energy particles. Theradiation is electromagnetic in character and may bemonochromatic or polychromatic: the electromagneticspectrum (Figure 5.1) conveniently indicates the widechoice of energy which is available. Wavelengths
⊿/NAK/triangleleftrange from heat, through the visible range
(/NAKD700–400 nm) to penetrating X-radiation. Using
de Broglie’s important relation /NAKDh/m
v,w h i c h
expresses the duality of radiation frequency andparticle momentum, it is possible to apply the ideaof wavelength to a stream of electrons.
Themicroscope,initsvariousforms,istheprincipal
tool of the materials scientist. The magniﬁcation
of the image produced by an electron microscope
can be extremely high; however, on occasion, the

126Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
modest magniﬁcation produced by a light stereo-
microscope can be sufﬁcient to solve a problem.In practical terms, the microscopist attaches moreimportance to resolution than magniﬁcation; that is,
the ability of the microscope to distinguish ﬁne detail.
In a given microscope, increasing the magniﬁcationbeyond a certain limit will fail to reveal furtherstructural detail; such magniﬁcation is said to be
‘empty’. Unaided, the human eye has a resolution of
about 0.1 mm: the resolution of light microscopes andelectron microscopes are, respectively, about 200 nmand 0.5 nm. In order to perceive or image a structural
feature it is necessary that the wavelength of the
probing radiation should be similar in size to that ofthe feature. In other words, and as will be enlarged
upon later, resolution is a function of wavelength.
In this chapter we examine the principal ways
in which light, X-rays, electrons, and neutronsare used to explore the structure of metals.
Some degree of selectivity has been unavoidable.
Although the prime purpose of microscopy is toprovide qualitative information on structure, manycomplementary techniques are available that provide
quantitative data on the chemical and physical
attributes of a material.
5.2 Light microscopy
5.2.1 Basic principles
The light microscope provides two-dimensionalrepresentation of structure over a total magniﬁcation
range of roughly 40 ðto 1250 ð. Interpretation of such
images is a matter of skill and experience and needsto allow for the three-dimensional nature of features
observed. The main components of a bench-typemicroscope are (1) an illumination system comprising
a light source and variable apertures, (2) an objectivelens and an ocular lens (eyepiece) mounted at the endsof a cylindrical body-tube, and (3) a specimen stage(ﬁxed or rotatable). Metallic specimens that are to
be examined at high magniﬁcations are successively
polished with 6, 1 and sometimes 0.25 /SYNM diamond
grit.Examinationintheas-polishedcondition,whichisgenerally advisable, willreveal structural features suchas shrinkage or gas porosity, cracks and inclusions of
foreign matter. Etching with an appropriate chemical
reagent is used to reveal the arrangement and sizeof grains, phase morphology, compositional gradients(coring), orientation-related etch pits and the effectsof plastic deformation. Although actually only a
few atomic diameters wide, grain boundaries are
preferentially and grossly attacked by many etchants.In bright-ﬁeld illumination, light is reﬂected backtowards the objective from reﬂective surfaces, causingthem to appear bright. Dark-ﬁeld illumination reverses
this effect, causing grain boundaries to appear bright.
The degree of chemical attack is sensitive to crystalorientationandanetchedpolycrystallineaggregatewilloften display its grain structure clearly (Figure 5.2a).Preparation techniques for ceramics are essentially
similar to those for metals and alloys. However, their
porosity can cause two problems. First, there is arisk of entrapping diamond particles during polishing,making ultrasonic cleaning advisable. Second, itmay be necessary to strengthen the structure by
impregnating with liquid resin in vacuo, provided that
pores are interconnected.
The objective, the most important and critical
component in the optical train of the light microscope,ismadeupofanumberofglasslensesand,sometimes,
ﬂuorite (CaF
2) lenses also. Lenses are subject to
Figure 5.2 (a) Reﬂection of light from etched specimen. (b) Use of oil to improve numerical aperture of objective .
The characterization of materials 127
spherical and chromatic aberrations. Minimization
and correction of these undesirable physical effects,
greatly aided by modern computational techniques,
is possible and objectives are classiﬁed according
to the degree of correction, i.e. achromats, ﬂuorites(semi-apochromats), apochromats. Lenses are usually
coated in order to increase light transmission. As
magniﬁcation is increased, the depth of ﬁeld of
the objective becomes smaller, typically falling from
250
µmat15 ðto0.08µmat1200 ð,sothatspecimen
ﬂatness becomes more critical. The focal length and
the working distance (separating its front lens from
the specimen) of an objective differ. For instance, an
f2 mm objective may have a working distance of
0.15 mm.
Resolution, rather than magniﬁcation, is usually the
prime concern of the skilled microscopist. It is the
smallest separating distance ( υ) that can be discerned
betweentwolinesintheimage.Theunaidedeye,atthe
least distance of comfortable vision (about 250 mm),can resolve 0.1 mm. Confusingly, the resolution value
for a lens with a so-called high resolving power is
small. Resolution is determined by (1) the wavelength
(/NAK) of the radiation and (2) the numerical aperture
(NA) of the objective and is expressed by the Abbeformula υD/NAK/2NA.
The numerical aperture value, which is engraved
upon the side of the objective, indicates the light-
gathering power of the compound lens system and
is obtained from the relation NA Dnsin˛,w h e r e n
is the refractive index of the medium between the
front lens face of the objective and the specimen,
and˛is the semi-apex angle of the light cone
deﬁned by the most oblique rays collected by the
lens. Numerical apertures range in typical value from0.08 to 1.25. Despite focusing difﬁculties and the
need for costly lenses, efforts have been made to use
short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation: developments
inelectronmicroscopyhave underminedthefeasibility
of this approach. Oil-immersion objectives enable therefractive index term to be increased (Figure 5.2b).
Thus, by replacing air ( nD1) with a layer of cedar
wood oil ( nD1.5) or monobromonaphthalene ( nD
1.66), the number of rays of reﬂected light accepted
by the front lens of the objective is increased andresolution and contrast are improved. The range
of wavelengths for visible light is approximately
400–700 nm; consequently, using the Abbe formula,
it can readily be shown that the resolution limit
of the light microscope is in the order of 200 nm.The ‘useful’ range of magniﬁcation is approximately
500–1000 NA. The lower end of the range can be
tiring to the eyes; at the top end, oil-immersion
objectives are useful.
Magniﬁcation is a subjective term; for instance, it
varies with the distance of an image or object from
the eye. Hence, microscopists sometimes indicate this
difﬁculty by usingthe more readily deﬁned term ‘scale
of reproduction’, which is the lineal size ratio of an
image (on a viewing screen or photomicrograph) tothe original object. Thus, strictly speaking, a statement
such as 500 ðbeneath a photomicrograph gives the
scale of reproduction, not the magniﬁcation.
The ocular magniﬁes the image formed by the
objective: the ﬁnally-observed image is virtual. It
can also correct for certain objective faults and, inphotomicrography,beusedtoprojectarealimage.Theocularcannotimprovetheresolutionofthesystembut,
if inferior in quality, can worsen it. The most widely
used magniﬁcations for oculars are 8 ðand 12 .5ð.
Two dimensional features of a standard bench
microscope, the mechanical tube length t
mand optical
tube length to, are of special signiﬁcance. The former
is the ﬁxed distance between the top of the body
tube, on which the ocular rests, and the shoulder of
the rotatable nosepiece into which several objectivesare screwed. Objectives are designed for a certaint
mvalue. A value of 160 mm is commonly used.
(In Victorian times, it was 250 mm, giving a rather
unwieldy instrument.) The optical tube length tois
the distance between the front focal point of the
ocular and the rear focal plane of the objective.
Parfocalization, using matched parfocal objectives andoculars, enables the specimen to remain in focus whenobjectives are step-changed by rotating the nosepiece.
With each change, t
ochanges but the image produced
by the objective always forms in the ﬁxed focalphase of the ocular. Thus the distance between the
specimen and the aerial image is kept constant. Some
manufacturers base their sequences of objective and
ocular magniﬁcations upon preferred numbers
1rather
than upon a decimal series. This device facilitates theselection of a basic set of lenses that is comprehensive
and ‘useful’ (exempt from ‘empty’ magniﬁcation). For
example, the Michel series of 6 .3ð,8ð,1 0ð,1 2.5ð,
16ð,2 0ð,2 5ð, etc., a geometrical progression with a
common ratio of approximately 1.25, provides a basis
for magniﬁcation values for objectives and oculars.
This rational approach is illustrated in Figure 5.3.Dot–dash lines represent oculars and thin solid
lines represent objectives. The bold lines outline a
box within which objective/ocular combinations give‘useful’ magniﬁcations. Thus, pairing of a 12 .5ð
ocular with a 40 ðobjective ⊿NAD0.65/triangleleftgives a
‘useful’ magniﬁcation of 500 ð.
5.2.2 Selected microscopical techniques
5.2.2.1 Phase-contrast microscopy
Phase-contrast microscopy is a technique that enables
special surface features to be studied even when
1The valuable concept of preferred numbers/sizes, currently
described in document PD 6481 of the British StandardsInstitution, was devised by a French military engineer,
Colonel Charles Renard (1847–1905). In 1879, during the
development of dirigible (steerable) balloons, he used ageometrical progression to classify cable diameters. A
typical Renard Series is 1.25, 1.6, 2.0, 2.5, 3.2, 4.0, 5.0, 6.4,
8.0, etc.

there is no colour or reﬂectivity contrast. The light
reﬂected from a small depression in a metallographicspecimen will be retarded in phase by a fractionof a light wavelength relative to that reﬂected fromthe surrounding matrix and, whereas in ordinarymicroscopy a phase difference in the light collected by
the objective will not contribute to contrast in the ﬁnalimage, in phase-contrast microscopy small differencesinphasesaretransformedintodifferencesinbrightnesswhich the eye can detect.
General uses of the technique include the
examination of multi-phased alloys after light etching,the detection of the early stages of precipitation,and the study of cleavage faces, twins and otherdeformation characteristics. The optimum range of
differences in surface level is about 20–50 nm,
although under favourable conditions these limitsmay be extended. A schematic diagram of the basicarrangement for phase contrast in the metallurgicalmicroscope is shown in Figure 5.4a. A hollow coneof light produced by an annulus A, is reﬂected by the
specimen and brought to an image in the back focalplane of the objective. A phase plate of suitable sizeshould, strictly, be positioned in this plane but, for theease of interchangeability of phase plates, the position
Qin front of the eyepiece Eis often preferred. This
phase plate has an annulus, formed either by etchingor deposition, such that the light it transmits is eitheradvanced or retarded by a quarter of a wavelengthrelative to the light transmitted by the rest of theplate and, because the light reﬂected from a surfacefeature is also advanced or retarded by approximately/NAK/4, the beam is either in phase or approximately /NAK/2
or/EMout of phase with that diffracted by the surface
features of the specimen. Consequently, reinforcement
or cancellation occurs, and the image intensity at any
point depends on the phase difference produced atthe corresponding point on the specimen surface, andthis in turn depends upon the height of this pointrelative to the adjacent parts of the surface. Whenthe light passing through the annulus is advanced inphase, positive phase contrast results and areas of

5.2.2.2 Polarized-light microscopy
The basic arrangement for the use of polarized light isshown in Figure 5.4b. The only requirements of thistechniqueare thattheincidentlightonthespecimenbeplane-polarized and that the reﬂected light be analysedby a polarizing unit in a crossed relation with respectto the polarizer, i.e. the plane of polarization of theanalyser is perpendicular to that of the polarizer.
The application of the technique depends upon the
fact that plane-polarized light striking the surface of
an optically isotropic metal is reﬂected unchanged if it
strikes at normal incidence. If the lightis not at normalincidence the reﬂected beam may still be unchangedbut only if the angle of incidence is in, or at rightangles to, the plane of polarization, otherwise it willbe elliptically polarized. It follows that the unchangedreﬂected beam will be extinguished by an analyser inthe crossed position whereas an elliptically polarizedone cannot be fully extinguished by an analyser inany position. When the specimen being examined is
optically anisotropic, the light incident normally is
reﬂectedwitharotationoftheplaneofpolarizationandas elliptically polarized light; the amount of rotationand of elliptical polarization is a property of the metaland of the crystal orientation.
If correctly prepared, as-polished specimens of
anisotropic metals will ‘respond’ to polarized light anda grain contrast effect is observed under crossed polarsas a variation of brightness with crystal orientation.Metals which have cubic structure, on the other hand,
willappearuniformlydarkundercrossedpolars,unless
etched to invoke artiﬁcial anisotropy, by producinganisotropic surface ﬁlms or well-deﬁned pits. An etchpit will reﬂect the light at oblique incidence andelliptically-polarized light will be produced. However,because such a beam cannot be fully extinguishedby the analyser in any position, it will produce abackground illumination in the image which tends tomask the grain contrast effect.
Clearly, one of the main uses of polarized light is to
distinguish between areas of varying orientation, since
these are revealed as differences of intensity undercrossed polars. The technique is, therefore, very usefulfor studyingtheeffects of deformation, particularlytheproduction of preferred orientation, but information oncleavage faces, twin bands and sub-grain boundariescan also be obtained. If a ‘sensitive tint’ plate isinserted between the vertical illuminator and theanalyser each grain of a sample may be identiﬁed bya characteristic colour which changes as the specimen
is rotated on the stage. This application is useful in
the assessment of the degree of preferred orientationand in recrystallizationstudies. Other uses of polarizedlight include distinguishing and identifying phases inmulti-phase alloys.Near-perfect extinction occurs when the polars of
a transmission microscope are crossed. If a thinsection or slice of ceramic, mineral or rock is
introduced and the stage slowly rotated, optically
anisotropic crystals will produce polarization colours,developing maximum brilliance at 45
°to any of
the four symmetrical positions of extinction. The
colour of a crystal depends upon its birefringence,or capacity for double-refraction, and thickness. By
standardizing the thickness of the section at 30–50
µm
and using a Michel-L ´evy colour chart, it is possible to
identifycrystallinespecies.Inrefractorymaterials, itis
relatively easy to identify periclase (MgO), chromite
⊿FeCrO 4/triangleleft, tridymite ⊿SiO2/triangleleftand zircon ⊿ZrSiO4/triangleleftby
their characteristic form and colour.
As birefringence occurs within the crystal, each
incident ray forms ordinary and extraordinary rayswhich are polarized in different planes and travel
through the crystal at different velocities. On leaving
the analyser, these out-of-phase ‘fast’ and ‘slow’rays combine to produce the polarization colour.
This colour is complementary to colour cancelled by
interference and follows Newton’s sequence: yellow,orange, red, violet, blue, green. More delicate, higher-
order colours are produced as the phase difference
between the emergent rays increases. Anisotropiccrystals are either uniaxial or biaxial, having one or
twoopticaxes,respectively,alongwhichbirefringence
does not occur. (Optic axes do not necessarilycorrespond with crystallographic axes.) It is therefore
possible for quartz (uniaxial) and mica (biaxial)
crystals to appear black because of their orientationin the slice. Uniaxial (tetragonal and hexagonal
systems) can be distinguished from biaxial crystals
(orthorhombic, triclinic and monoclinic systems) byintroducing a Bertrand lens into the light train of the
microscope to give a convergent beam, rotating the
stageandcomparingtheirinterferenceﬁgures:uniaxialcrystals give a moving ‘ring and brush’ pattern, biaxial
crystals give two static ‘eyes’. Cubic crystals are
isotropic, being highly symmetrical. Glassy phases areisotropicandalsoappearblackbetweencrossedpolars;
however, glass containing residual stresses from rapid
cooling produces fringe patterns and polarizationcolours. The stress-anisotropic properties of plastics
are utilized in photoelastic analyses of transparent
models of engineering structures or components madefrom standard sheets of constant thickness and stress-
optic coefﬁcient (e.g. clear Bakelite, epoxy resin).
The fringe patterns produced by monochromaticlight and crossed polars in a polariscope reveal the
magnitude and direction of the principal stresses
that are developed when typical working loads are
applied.
5.2.2.3 Hot-stage microscopy
The ability to observe and photograph phasetransformations and structural changes in metals,
ceramics and polymers at high magniﬁcations while
130Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
being heated holds an obvious attraction. Various
designsofmicrofurnacecellareavailableformounting
in light microscope systems.
For studies at moderate temperatures, such
as spherulite formation in a cooling melt ofpolypropylene, the sample can be placed on a glass
slide, heated in a stage ﬁtment, and viewed through
crossed polars with transmitted light. For metals,which have an increasing tendency to vaporize asthe temperature is raised, the polished sample isenclosed in a resistance-heated microfurnace and
viewed by reﬂected light through an optically worked
window of fused silica. The chamber can be eitherevacuated (10
/NUL6torr) or slowly purged with inert gas
(argon). The later must be dry and oxygen-free. APt:Pt–10Rh thermocople is inserted in the specimen.
The furnace should have a low thermal inertia and
be capable of heating or cooling the specimen atcontrolled rates; temperatures of up to 1800
°Ca r e
possible in some designs. The presence of a window,
and possibly cooling devices, drastically reduces the
available working distance for the objective lens,particularly when a large numerical aperture or highmagniﬁcation are desired. One common solution is touse a Burch-type reﬂecting objective with an internal
mirrorsystemwhichgivesausefulworkingdistanceof
13–14 mm. The type of stage unit described has beenused for studies of grain growth in austenite and theformation of bainite and martensite in steels, allotropictransformations, and sintering mechanisms in powder
compacts.
When polished polycrystalline material is heated,
individual grains tend to reduce their volume asa result of surface tension and grain boundariesappear as black lines, an effect referred to as thermal
etching or grooving. If a grain boundary migrates,
as in the grain growth stage of annealing, ghostimages of former grooves act as useful markers. Asthe melting point is approached, there is often anoticeable tendency for grain boundary regions to fuse
before the bulk grains; this liquation effect is due
to the presence of impurities and the atomic misﬁtacross the grain boundary surface. When interpretingthe visible results of hot-stage microscopy, it isimportant to bear in mind that surface effects do
not necessarily reﬂect what is happening within the
bulk material beneath the surface. The technique canproduce artefacts; the choice between evacuation andgas-purging can be crucial. For instance, heating in
vacuocanfavourdecarburizationandgrain-coarsening
in steel specimens.
The classic method for studying high-temperature
phases and their equilibria in oxide systems wasbased upon rapid quenching (e.g. silicates). Thisindirect method is slow and does not always
preserve the high-temperature phase(s). A direct
microscopical technique uses the U-shaped notch ofa thermocouple hot junction as the support for asmall non-metallic sample. In the original design,

the junction was alternately connected by high-speed
relay at a frequency of 50 Hz to a power circuit and
a temperature-measuring circuit. The sample could
be heated to temperatures of up to 2150 °Ca n di t
was possible to observe crystallization from a melt
directly through crossed polars. Although unsuitable
for metals and highly volatile materials, the technique
hasbeenappliedtoglasses,slags,refractories,Portlandcements, etc., providinginformationonphasechanges,
devitriﬁcation, sintering shrinkage, grain growth and
the ‘wetting’ of solids by melts.
5.2.2.4 Microhardness testing
The measurement of hardness with a microscope
attachment, comprising a diamond indentor and
means for applying small loads, dates back more
than 50 years. Initially used for small components
(watch gears, thin wire, foils), microhardness testing
was extended to research studies of individual
phases, orientation effects in single crystals, diffusion
gradients, ageing phenomena, etc. in metallic and
ceramic materials. Nowadays, testing at temperaturesup to 1000
°C is possible. In Europe, the pyramidal
Vickers-type (interfacial angle 136 °) indentor, which
produces a square impression, is generally favoured.
Its counterpart in general engineering employs test
loads of 5–100 kgf: in microhardness testing, typical
test loads are in the range 1–100 gf (1 gf D1 pond D
1pD9.81 mN). A rhombic-based Knoop indentor of
American origin has been recommended for brittle
and/or anisotropic material (e.g. carbides, oxides,
glass) and for thin foils and coatings where a shallow
depth of impression is desired. The kite-shaped Knoopimpression is elongated, with a 7:1 axial ratio.
Microhardness tests need to be very carefully con-
trolledand replicated, usingas large a loadas possible.
The surface of the specimen should be strain-free (e.g.
electropolished), plane and perpendicular to the inden-
tor axis. The indentor is lowered slowly at a rate of
<1m mm i n
/NUL1under vibration-free conditions, even-
tuallydeformingthetestsurfaceinamanneranalogous
to steady-state creep. Thisconditionis achieved within
15 s, a test period commonly used.
TheequationsforVickershardness( HV)andKnoop
hardness ( HK) take the following forms:
HVD1854.4⊿P/d2/triangleleftkgf mm/NUL2⊿5.1/triangleleft
HKD14228 ⊿P/d2/triangleleftkgf mm/NUL2⊿5.2/triangleleft
In these equations, which have the dimensions of
stress, load Pand diagonal length dare measured in
gf and /SYNm, respectively. The ﬁrst equation is based
upon the surface area of the impression; the second
is based upon its projected area and the length of the
long diagonal.

Research Station, Watford.
The characterization of materials 131
The main potential difﬁculty concerns the possi-
ble dependence of microhardness values ( Hm) upon
test load. As the test load is reduced below a cer-
tain threshold, the measured microhardness value may
tend to decrease or increase, depending upon the mate-rial. In these circumstances, when measuring absolute
hardness rather than relative hardness, it is useful to
considerthematerial’sbehaviourintermsoftheMeyer
equation which relates indenting force Pto the diag-
onal length of the Vickers-type impression produced,d, as follows:
PDkd
n(5.3)
The Meyer exponent nexpresses the strain-hardening
characteristics of the material as it deforms plastically
during the test; it increases in value with the degreeof strain-hardening. For simple comparisons of rela-
tive microhardness, hardness values at a ﬁxed load can
be compared without allowance for load-dependence.
On the other hand, if absolute values of hardness are
required from low-load tests, it is advisable to deter-mine the Meyer line for the particular material over
a comparatively small load range by plotting Pval-
ues against the corresponding dvalues, using log-log
graph paper. (Extrapolations beyond the chosen load
range are unwise because the proﬁle of the Meyerline may change.) Figure 5.5 shows the Meyer line,
slopen, for a material giving load-dependent micro-
hardness values. The slope nis less than 2, which
is usual. The H
mcurve has a negative slope and
microhardness values increase as the load increases.One way of reporting load-dependent microhardness
results is to state three hardness numbers in terms of
Figure 5.5 Meyer line for material with load-independent
hardness (by courtesy of Carl Zeiss, Germany) .a standard set of three diagonal d-values, as shown in
Figure 5.5. The approximate values for the set shown
areH5/SYNmD160,H10/SYNmD140,H20/SYNmD120. When
the anisotropy ratio for elastic moduli is high, micro-
hardness values can vary greatly from grain to grain
in polycrystalline material.
CombinationoftheVickersequationwiththeMeyer
equation gives the following expression:
HVDconstant ðdn/NUL2(5.4)
Accordingly, if nD2, which is true for the conven-
tional Vickers macrohardness test, the gradient of the
Hmline becomes zero and hardness values are conve-
niently load-independent.
5.2.2.5 Quantitative microscopy
Important standard methods for measuring grain sizeand contents of inclusions and phases have evolved
in metallurgy and mineralogy. Grain size in metal-lic structures is commonly assessed by the ASTM
(McQuaid-Ehn) method in which etched microstruc-
tures are compared with diagrams or standard sets of
photographs at a standard magniﬁcation, say 100 ð.
Numerous manual methods have been developed to
assess the cleanliness of steels. They range from
direct methods, in which particles beneath linearly-traversed crosswires are individually counted, to com-
parative methods based on photomicrographs or charts
(e.g. Fox, Jernkontoret (JK), SAE-ASTM, Diergarten).
Sometimes these methods attempt to identify inclu-
sions according to type and form. Nowadays, auto-
matic systems are available to convert microscopical
information, from a light or electron microscope, toelectronic signals that can be rapidly processed and
evaluated. Although more objective than former meth-
ods, they must be set up correctly and their limitations
appreciated. For instance, the plane of sectioning is
critical when highly-directional features are present,
such as ﬁlaments in composites and slag stringers in
metals. Quantitative methods have made it possibleto relate many microstructural characteristics, such as
volume fractions, interparticle distances, grain bound-
ary area per unit volume, interlamellar spacing, etc.,
to mechanical properties. In 1848, the French petro-
grapher Delesse established mathematically that, in a
fully random cross-section of a uniform aggregate, the
area fraction of a given microconstituent (phase) ina ﬁeld of view is equal to the corresponding volume
fraction in the three-dimensional aggregate. There are
three basic methods for measuring the area fraction, as
the following exercise demonstrates.
Suppose that a certain ﬁeld of view contains a
dark phase and a light-coloured matrix, as shown in
Figure 5.6a. Using the systematic notation for stereol-ogy given in Table 5.1, the total area occupied by the

eal method was used in the original Quantimet instru-
ments which scanned1the images electronically with a

Certain three-dimensional properties of a structure
have a great inﬂuence on a material’s behaviour
but cannot be measured directly by microscope. Forinstance, the amount of curved grain boundary surface

5.3 X-ray diffraction analysis
5.3.1 Production and absorption of X-rays
The use of diffraction methods is of great importance
in the analysis of crystalline solids. Not only can
they reveal the main features of the structure, i.e.
the lattice parameter and type of structure, but alsoother detailssuch as the arrangement of different kinds
of atoms in crystals, the presence of imperfections,
the orientation, sub-grain and grain size, the size anddensity of precipitates.
X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation dif-
fering from light waves ( /NAKD400–800 nm) in that
they have a shorter wavelength ( /NAK³0.1n m ) .T h e s e
rays are produced when a metal target is bombardedwith fast electrons in a vacuum tube. The radiation
emitted, as shown in Figure 5.8a, can be separated
into two components, a continuous spectrum whichis spread over a wide range of wavelengths and asuperimposed line spectrum characteristic of the metal
being bombarded. The energy of the ‘white’ radiation,
as the continuous spectrum is called, increases as theatomic number of the target and approximately as the
square of the applied voltage, while the characteris-
tic radiation is excited only when a certain criticalvoltageisexceeded.Thecharacteristicradiationispro-duced when the accelerated electrons have sufﬁcient
energy to eject one of the inner electrons (1 s-level, for
example) from its shell. The vacant 1 s-level is then
occupied by one of the other electrons from a higherenergy level, and during the transition an emission
of X-radiation takes place. If the electron falls from
an adjacent shell then the radiation emitted is knownasK˛-radiation, since the vacancy in the ﬁrst K-shell

vDEL/NULEK (5.5)
However,ifthe K-shellvacancyisﬁlledbyanelectron
from anM-shell (i.e. the next highest quantum shell)
thenKˇ-radiation is emitted. Figure 5.8 shows that, in
fact, one cannot be excited without the other, and thecharacteristic K-radiation emitted from a copper target
is in detail composed of a strong K˛-doublet and a
weakerKˇ-line.
In transversing a specimen, an X-ray beam loses
intensity according to the equation
IDI
0exp[/NUL/SYNx] (5.6)
whereI0andIare the values of the initial and
ﬁnal intensities respectively, /SYNis a constant, known
as the linear absorption coefﬁcient which depends

the absorber, and xis the thickness of the speci-
men.1The variation of mass absorption coefﬁcient,
i.e. linear absorption coefﬁcient divided by density,
/SYN//SUB, with wavelength is of particular interest, as
shown in Figure 5.8b, which is the curve for nickel.
It varies approximately as /NAK3until a critical value
of/NAK⊿D0.148 nm/triangleleftis reached, when the absorption
decreases precipitously. The critical wavelength /NAKKat
which this decrease occurs is known as the Kabsorp-
tion edge, and is the value at which the X-ray beam
has acquired just sufﬁcient energy to eject an elec-
tron from the K-shell of the absorbing material. The
value of/NAKKis characteristic of the absorbing material,
and similar LandMabsorption edges occur at higher
wavelengths.
This sharp variation in absorption with wavelength
has many applications in X-ray practice, but its most
common use is in ﬁltering out unwanted Kˇ-radiation.
For example, if a thin piece of nickel foil is placedin a beam of X-rays from a copper target, absorption
of some of the short wavelength ‘white’ radiation
and most of the Kˇ-radiation will result, but the
1This absorption equation is the basis of radiography, since
a cavity, crack or similar defect will have a much lower/SYN-value than the sound metal. Such defects can be detected
by the appearance of an intensity difference registered on aphotographic ﬁlm placed behind the X-irradiated object.
134Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
strongK˛-radiation will be only slightly attenuated.
This ﬁltered radiation is sufﬁciently monochromatic
for many X-ray techniques, but for more specialized
studies when a pure monochromatic beam is required,
crystal monochromators are used. The X-ray beam is
then reﬂected from a crystal, such as quartz or lithium
ﬂuoride, which is oriented so that only the desired
wavelengthisreﬂectedaccordingtotheBragglaw(see
below).
5.3.2 Diffraction of X-rays by crystals
The phenomena of interference and diffraction arecommonplace in the ﬁeld of light. The standard schoolphysicslaboratoryexperimentistodeterminethespac-
ing of a grating, knowing the wavelength of the
light impinging on it, by measuring the angles of the
diffracted beam. The only conditions imposed on the
experiment are that (1) the grating be periodic, and
(2) the wavelength of the light is of the same order
of magnitude as the spacing to be determined. This
experiment immediately points to the application of
X-raysindeterminingthespacingandinter-atomicdis-
tances in crystals, since both are about 0.1–0.4 nm in
dimension. Rigorous consideration of diffraction from
a crystal in terms of a three-dimensional diffraction
grating is complex, but Bragg simpliﬁed the problem
by showing that diffraction is equivalent to symmetri-
cal reﬂection from the various crystal planes, provided
certain conditions are fulﬁlled. Figure 5.9a shows a
beamofX-raysofwavelength /NAK,impingingatanangle
/DC2on a set of crystal planes of spacing d. The beam
reﬂected at the angle /DC2can be real only if the rays
from each successive plane reinforce each other. For
this to be the case, the extra distance a ray, scattered
from each successive plane, has to travel, i.e. the path
difference, must be equal to an integral number of
wavelengths, n/NAK. For example, the second ray shown
in Figure 5.9a has to travel further than the ﬁrst ray
by the distance POCOQ. The condition for reﬂection
and reinforcement is then given by
n/NAKDPOCOQD2ONsin/DC2D2dsin/DC2(5.7)This is the well-known Bragg law and the critical
angular values of /DC2for which the law is satisﬁed are
known as Bragg angles.
The directionsof thereﬂected beams are determined
entirely by the geometry of the lattice, which in turn ingoverned by the orientation and spacing of the crystalplanes. If for a crystal of cubic symmetry we are giventhe size of the structure cell, a, the angles at which

To illustrate this let us take as an example the second-order reﬂection from (100) planes. Then, since nD2,

either as the 200 reﬂection or as line 4. The latticeplanes which give rise to a reﬂection at the smallestBragg angle are those which are most widely spaced,i.e. those with a spacing equal to the cell edge, d

To ensure that Bragg’s law is satisﬁed and that
reﬂections from various crystal planes can occur, itis necessary to provide a range of either /DC2or/NAKvalues.

5.3.3 X-ray diffraction methods
5.3.3.1 Laue method
In the Laue method, a stationary single crystal is
bathed in a beam of ‘white’ radiation. Then, becausethe specimen is a ﬁxed single crystal, the variable nec-essary to ensure that the Bragg law is satisﬁed for allthe planes in the crystal has to be provided by therange of wavelengthsin the beam, i.e. each set of crys-tal planes chooses the appropriate /NAKfrom the ‘white’
spectrum to give a Bragg reﬂection. Radiation from atarget metal having a high atomic number (e.g. tung-sten) is often used, but almost any form of ‘white’radiation is suitable. In the experimental arrangementshown in Figure 5.10a, either a transmission photo-graph or a back-reﬂection photograph may be taken,and the pattern of spots which are produced lie onellipses in the transmission case or hyperbolae in theback-reﬂection case. All spots on any ellipse or hyper-bola are reﬂections from planes of a single zone (i.e.where all the lattice planes are parallel to a commondirection, the zone axis) and, consequently, the Lauepattern is able to indicate the symmetry of the crystal.
For example, if the beam is directed along a [111] or
[100] direction in the crystal, the Laue pattern willshow three- or fourfold symmetry, respectively. TheLaue method is used extensively for the determina-tion of the orientation of single crystals and, whilecharts are available to facilitate this determination, themethod consists essentially of plotting the zones takenfrom the ﬁlm on to a stereogram, and comparing theangles between them with a standard projection of thatcrystal structure. In recent years the use of the Lauetechnique has been extended to the study of imper-fections resulting from crystal growth or deformation,because it is found that the Laue spots from perfectcrystals are sharp, while those from deformed crystalsare, as shown in Figure 5.10b, elongated. This elon-gated appearance of the diffraction spots is known asasterismanditarisesinananalogouswaytothereﬂec-tion of light from curved mirrors.
5.3.3.2 Powder method
The powder method, devised independently by Debyeand Scherrer, is probably the most generally useful ofall the X-ray techniques. It employs monochromaticradiation and a ﬁnely-powdered, or ﬁne-grained poly-crystalline, wire specimen. In this case, /DC2is the vari-
able, since the collection of randomly-oriented crystalswill contain sufﬁcient particles with the correct orien-tation to allow reﬂection from each of the possiblereﬂecting planes, i.e. the powder pattern results froma series of superimposed rotating crystal patterns. Theangle between the direct X-ray beam and the reﬂectedray is 2/DC2, and consequently each set of crystal planes
gives rise to a cone of reﬂected rays of semi-angle 2 /DC2,
where/DC2is the Bragg angle for that particular set of
reﬂecting planes producing the cone. Thus, if a ﬁlm isplaced around the specimen, as shown in Figure 5.11,
Figure 5.10 (a) Laue method of X-ray diffraction.
(b) Asterisms on a Laue transmission photograph of
deformed zinc (after Cahn, 1949) .
the successive diffracted cones, which consist of rays
from hundreds of grains, intersect the ﬁlm to produceconcentric curves around the entrance and exit holes.Figure 5.12 shows examples of patterns from bcc andfcc materials, respectively.
Precise measurement of the pattern of diffraction
lines is required for many applications of the powdermethod, but a good deal of information can readily beobtained merely by inspection. One example of thisis in the study of deformed metals, since after defor-mation the individual spots on the diffraction rings areblurredsomuchthatline-broadeningoccurs,especially

The characterization of materials 137
at high Bragg angles. On low-temperature annealing,
the cold-worked material will tend to recover and thisis indicated on the photograph by a sharpening of the
broad diffraction lines. At higher annealing tempera-
tures the metal will completely regain its softness by aprocess known as recrystallization (see Chapter 7) and
this phenomenon is accompanied by the completion
of the line-sharpening process. With continued anneal-ing, the grains absorb each other to produce a structure
with an overall coarser grain size and, because fewer
reﬂections are available to contribute to the diffrac-tion cones, the lines on the powder photograph take
on a spotty appearance. This latter behaviour is some-
times used as a means of determining the grain size of
a polycrystalline sample. In practice, an X-ray photo-
graph is taken for each of a series of knowngrain sizesto form a set of standards, and with them an unknown
grain size can be determined quite quickly by com-
paring the corresponding photograph with the set ofstandards. Yet a third use of the powder method as an
inspection technique is in the detection of a preferredorientation of the grains of a polycrystalline aggregate.This is because a random orientation of the grains will
produce a uniformly intense diffraction ring, while a
preferred orientation, or texture, will concentrate theintensity at certain positions on the ring. The details
of the texture require considerable interpretation and
are discussed in Chapter 7.
5.3.3.3 X-ray diffractometry
In addition to photographic recording, the diffractedX-ray beam may be detected directly using a countertube (either Geiger, proportional or scintillation type)
with associated electrical circuitry. The geometrical
arrangement of such an X-ray diffractometer is shownin Figure 5.13a. A divergent beam of ﬁltered or
monochromatized radiation impinges on the ﬂat face
of a powder specimen. This specimen is rotated at
Figure 5.13 Geometry of (a) conventional diffractometer and (b) small-angle scattering diffractometer, (c) chart record of

138Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
preciselyone-halfof theangularspeedof thereceiving
slit so that a constant angle between the incident andreﬂected beams is maintained. The receiving slit ismounted in front of the counter on the counter tube
arm, and behind it is usually ﬁxed a scatter slit to
ensure that the counter receives radiation only fromthe portion of the specimen illuminated by the primarybeam. The intensity diffracted at the various angles is
recorded automatically on a chart of the form shown
in Figure 5.13c, and this can quickly be analysed forthe appropriate /DC2anddvalues.
The technique is widely used in routine chemical
analysis, since accurate intensity measurements allow
a quantitative estimate of the various elements in thesample to be made. In research, the technique hasbeen applied to problems such as the degree of order
in alloys, the density of stacking faults in deformed
alloys, elastic constant determination, the study ofimperfections and preferred orientation.
5.3.3.4 X-ray topography
With X-rays it is possible to study individual crys-
tal defects by detecting the differences in intensity
diffracted by regions of the crystal near dislocations,for example, and more nearly perfect regions of thecrystal. Figure 5.14a shows the experimental arrange-
ment schematically in which collimated monochro-
matic K˛-radiation and photographic recording is
used.
Any imperfections give rise to local changes in
diffracted or transmitted X-ray intensities and, con-
sequently, dislocations show up as bands of contrast,some 5 to 50
µm wide. No magniﬁcation is used inrecording the diffraction image, but subsequentmagni-
ﬁcation of up to 500 times may be achieved with high-
resolution X-ray emulsions. Large areas of the crystalto thicknesses of 10–100
µm can be mapped using
scanning techniques provided the dislocation density
is not too high ⊿6>1010m/NUL2/triangleleft.
The X-ray method of detecting lattice defects suf-
fers from the general limitations that the resolution
is low and exposure times are long (12 h) although
very high intensity X-ray sources are now avail-able from synchrotrons and are being used increas-
ingly with very short exposure times ( ¾minutes). By
comparison, the thin-ﬁlm electron microscopy method(see Section 5.4.2) is capable of revealing dislocations
with a much higher resolution because the disloca-
tion image width is 10 nm or less and magniﬁcationsup to 100000 times are possible. The X-ray method
does, however, have the great advantage of being able
to reveal dislocations in crystals which are compara-tively thick ( ¾1 mm, cf. 0.1
µm in foils suitable for
transmission electron microscopy). The technique has
been used for studying in detail the nature of dis-locations in thick single crystals with very low dis-
location densities, such as found in semiconducting
materials; Figure 5.14b shows an example of an X-raytopograph revealing dislocations in magnesium by this
technique.
5.3.4 Typical interpretative procedures for
diffraction patterns
5.3.4.1 Intensity of diffraction
Many applications of the powder method depend on
the accurate measurement of either line position or

dislocation loops, gD011 0 (after Vale and Smallman, 1977) .

line intensity. The arrangement of the diffraction lines
in any pattern is characteristic of the material being
examined and, consequently, an important practicaluse of the method is in the identiﬁcation of unknown
phases. Thus, it will be evident that equation (5.9)
can indicate the position of the reﬂected beams,
as determined by the size and shape of the unit
cell, but not the intensities of the reﬂected beams.These are determined not by the size of the unit
cell but by the distribution of atoms within it,
and while cubic lattices give reﬂections for every
possible value of ⊿h
2Ck2Cl2/triangleleftall other structures
give characteristic absences. Studying the indices ofthe ‘absent’ reﬂections enables different structures to
be distinguished.
In calculating the intensity scattered by a given
atomic structure, we have ﬁrst to consider the inten-
sity scattered by one atom, and then go on to consider
the contribution from all the other atoms in the par-ticular arrangement which make up that structure. The
efﬁciency of an atom in scattering X-rays is usually
denoted by f, the atomic scattering factor, which is
the ratio of amplitude scattered by an atom A
ato that
by a single electron Ae. If atoms were merely points,
their scattering factors would be equal to the numberof electrons they contain, i.e. to their atomic numbers,
and the relation I
aDZ2.Iewould hold since intensity
is proportional to the square of amplitude. However,
becausethesizeoftheatomiscomparabletothewave-length of X-rays, scattering from different parts of the
atom is not in phase, and the result is that I
a/DC4Z2.Ie.
The scattering factor, therefore, depends both on angle
/DC2and on the wavelength of X-rays used, as shown in
Figure 5.9, because the path difference for the individ-ual waves scattered from the various electrons in the
atom is zero when /DC2D0 and increases with increasing
/DC2. Thus, to consider the intensity scattered by a given
structure, it is necessary to sum up the waves which
come from all the atoms of one unit cell of that struc-
ture, since each wave has a different amplitude anda different phase angle due to the fact that it comes
from a different part of the structure. The square of
the amplitude of the resultant wave, F, then gives the
intensity, and this may be calculated by using the f-
values and the atomic coordinates of each atom in the
unit cell. It can be shown that a general formula forthe intensity is
I/jFj

where x1,y1,z1;x2,y2,z2, etc., are the coordinates
of those atoms having scattering factors f1,f2,e t c . ,
respectively, and hklare the indices of the reﬂection
being computed. For structures having a centre ofsymmetry, which includes most metals, the expression
is much simpler because the sine terms vanish.
This equation may be applied to any structure,
but to illustrate its use let us examine a pure metal
crystallizing in the bcc structure. From Figure 2.11cit is clear that the structure has identical atoms (i.e.
f
1Df2) at the coordinates ⊿000/triangleleftandf1

equation (5.10) becomes:
I/f2[cos2 /EM.0Ccos2 /EM⊿h/2Ck/2Cl/2/triangleleft]2
Df2[1Ccos/EM⊿hCkCl/triangleleft]2⊿5.11/triangleleft
It then follows that Iis equal to zero for every
reﬂection having ⊿hCkCl/triangleleftan odd number. The
signiﬁcance of this is made clear if we considerin a qualitative way the 100 reﬂection shown in
Figure 5.15a. To describe a reﬂection as the ﬁrst-order
reﬂection from ⊿100/triangleleftplanes implies that there is
1/NAKphase-difference between the rays reﬂected from
planes Aand those reﬂected from planes A
0.H o w e v e r ,
the reﬂection from the plane Bsituated half-way
between AandA0will be /NAK/2 out of phase with that
from plane A, so that complete cancellationof the 100
reﬂectedraywilloccur.The100reﬂectionistherefore
absent, which agrees with the prediction made from
equation (5.11) that the reﬂection is missing when⊿hCkCl/triangleleftisanoddnumber.Asimilaranalysisshows
that the 200 reﬂection will be present (Figure 5.15b),
since the ray from the Bplane is now exactly 1 /NAKout
of phase with the rays from AandA
0. In consequence,
if a diffraction pattern is taken from a material having
a bcc structure, because of the rule governing the sumof the indices, the ﬁlm will show diffraction lines
almost equally spaced with indices ND2,⊿110/triangleleft;
4,⊿200/triangleleft;6 , ⊿211/triangleleft;8 , ⊿220/triangleleft;..., as shown in
Figure 5.12a. Application of equation (5.10) to a pure

140Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
metal with fcc structure shows that ‘absent’ reﬂections
will occur when the indices of that reﬂection aremixed, i.e. when they are neither all odd nor all even.
Thus,thecorrespondingdiffractionpatternwillcontain
lines according to ND3,4,8,11,12,16,19,20, etc;
and the characteristic feature of the arrangement is
a sequence of two lines close together and one line
separated, as shown in Figure 5.12b.
Equation (5.10) is the basic equation used for deter-
mining unknown structures, since the determination of
the atomic positions in a crystal is based on this rela-
tion between the coordinates of an atom in a unit cell
and the intensity with which it will scatter X-rays.
5.3.4.2 Determination of lattice parameters
Perhaps the most common use of the powder method
is in the accurate determination of lattice parame-
ters. From the Bragg law we have the relation aD
/NAKpN/2sin /DC2which, because both /NAKandNare known
and/DC2can be measured for the appropriate reﬂection,
can be used to determine the lattice parameter of a
material. Several errors are inherent in the method,however, and the most common include shrinkage of
the ﬁlm during processing, eccentricity of the speci-
men and the camera, and absorption of the X-rays in
the sample. These errors affect the high-angle diffrac-
tion lines least and, consequently, the most accurate
parameter value is given by determining a value of
afrom each diffraction line, plotting it on a graph
againstanangularfunction
1ofthecos2/DC2-typeandthen
extrapolating the curve to /DC2D90°.
The determination of precision lattice parameters is
of importance in many ﬁelds of materials science, par-
ticularlyinthe studyof thermal expansioncoefﬁcients,density determinations, the variation of properties with
composition, precipitation from solid solution, and
thermal stresses. At this stage it is instructive to con-

powder sample from the high temperature to room
temperature (in order to retain the high temperature
state of solid solution down to room temperature) andthen taking a powder photograph at room temperature.
5.3.4.3 Line-broadening
Diffraction lines are not always sharp because ofvarious instrumental factors such as slit size, specimencondition, and spread of wavelengths, but in addition
the lines may be broadened as a result of lattice strain
in the region of the crystal diffracting and also itslimiteddimension.Straingivesrisetoavariationofthe

5.3.4.4 Small-angle scattering
The scattering of intensity into the low-angle region
⊿εD2/DC2<10°/triangleleftarises from the presence of inhomo-
geneities within the material being examined (such as
small clusters of solute atoms), where these inhomo-
geneities have dimensions only 10 to 100 times the
wavelength of the incident radiation. The origin ofthe scattering can be attributed to the differences in
electron density between the heterogeneous regions
and the surrounding matrix,
1so that precipitated par-
ticles afford the most common source of scattering;other heterogeneities such as dislocations, vacancies
and cavities must also give rise to some small-angle
scattering, but the intensity of the scattered beam will
be much weaker than this from precipitated particles.
The experimental arrangement suitable for this type of
study is shown in Figure 5.13b.
Interpretation of much of the small-angle scatter
data is based on the approximate formula derived by
Guinier,
IDMn
2Ieexp[/NUL4/EM2ε2R2/3/NAK2] (5.14)
whereMis the number of scattering aggregates, or
particles, in the sample, nrepresents the difference in
number of electrons between the particle and an equal
volume of the surrounding matrix, Ris the radius of
gyration of the particle, Ieis the intensity scattered
by an electron, εis the angle of scattering and /NAKis
the wavelength of X-rays. From this equation it can
be seen that the intensity of small-angle scattering is
zero if the inhomogeneity, or cluster, has an electron
density equivalent to that of the surrounding matrix,
even if it has quite different crystal structure. On a
plot of log10Ias a function of ε2, the slope near the
origin,εD0, is given by
PD/NUL⊿4/EM2/3/NAK2/triangleleftR2log10e
which for Cu K˛radiation gives the radius of gyration
of the scattering aggregate to be
RD0.0645ðP1/2nm (5.15)
It is clear that the technique is ideal for studying
regions of the structure where segregation on too ﬁne
a scale to be observable in the light microscope has
occurred, e.g. the early stages of phase precipitation
1The halo around the moon seen on a clear frosty night is
the best example, obtained without special apparatus, of thescattering of light at small angles by small particles.(see Chapter 8), and the aggregation of lattice defects
(see Chapter 4).
5.3.4.5 The reciprocal lattice concept
TheBragglawshowsthattheconditionsfordiffraction
depend on the geometry of sets of crystal planes. Tosimplify the more complex diffraction problems, useis made of the reciprocal lattice concept in which thesets of lattice planes are replaced by a set of points,
this being geometrically simpler.
The reciprocal lattice is constructed from the real
lattice by drawing a line from the origin normal tothe lattice plane hklunder consideration of length,
d
Ł, equal to the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing
dhkl. The construction of part of the reciprocal lattice
from a face-centred cubic crystal lattice is shown inFigure 5.17.
Included in the reciprocal lattice are the points
which correspond not only to the true lattice planes
with Miller indices ( hkl) but also to the ﬁctitious
planes ( nh, nk, nl ) which give possible X-ray
reﬂections.Thereciprocallatticethereforecorresponds
to the diffraction spectrum possible from a particular
crystal lattice and, since a particular lattice type ischaracterized by ‘absent’ reﬂections the correspondingspots in the reciprocal lattice will also be missing. Itcan be deduced that a fcc Bravais lattice is equivalent
to a bcc reciprocal lattice, and vice versa.

and the Bragg law is satisﬁed; the line joining the
origin to the operating reciprocal lattice spot is usuallyreferred to as the g-vector. It will be evident that at
any one setting of the crystal, few, if any, points will
touch the sphere of reﬂection. This is the conditionfor a stationary single crystal and a monochromaticbeam of X-rays, when the Bragg law is not obeyedexcept by chance. To ensure that the Bragg law issatisﬁed the crystal has to be rotated in the beam, sincethis corresponds to a rotation of the reciprocal latticeabouttheoriginwheneachpointmustpassthroughthereﬂection surface. The corresponding reﬂecting plane
reﬂects twice per revolution.
To illustrate this feature let us re-examine the pow-
der method. In the powder specimen, the number ofcrystals is sufﬁciently large that all possible orienta-tions are present and in terms of the reciprocal latticeconstruction we may suppose that the reciprocal lat-tice is rotated about the origin in all possible direc-tions. The locus of any one lattice point during sucha rotation is, of course, a sphere. This locus-sphere
will intersect the sphere of reﬂection in a small cir-
cle about the axis of the incident beam as shown inFigure 5.19, and any line joining the centre of thereﬂectionspheretoapointonthissmallcircleisapos-sible direction for a diffraction maximum. This smallcircle corresponds to the powder halo discussed previ-
ously. From Figure 5.19 it can be seen that the radius

ation of the diffracted beam 2 /DC2is given by the relation

which is the Bragg condition.
5.4 Analytical electron microscopy
5.4.1 Interaction of an electron beam with a
solid
When an electronbeam isincidenton a solidspecimen
anumberofinteractionstakeplacewhichgenerateuse-
ful structural information. Figure 5.20 illustrates theseinteractions schematically. Some of the incident beam
is back-scattered and some penetrates the sample. If
the specimen is thin enough a signiﬁcant amount istransmitted, with some electrons elastically scattered
withoutlossofenergyandsomeinelasticallyscattered.
Interaction with the atoms in the specimen leads to theejection of low-energy electrons and the creation of
X-ray photons and Auger electrons, all of which can
be used to characterize the material.
The two inelastic scattering mechanisms important
in chemical analysis are (1) excitation of the electron
gas plasmon scattering, and (2) single-electron scat-tering. In plasmon scattering the fast electron excites
a ripple in the plasma of free electrons in the solid.
The energy of this ‘plasmon’ depends only on the vol-ume concentration of free electrons nin the solid and
given byE

Figure 5.20 Scattering of incident electrons by thin foil.
With a bulk specimen the transmitted, elastic and inelastic
scattered beams are absorbed .
The characterization of materials 143
of the plasmon is converted very quickly into atom
vibrations (heat) and the mean-free path for plasmonexcitationis small, ³50–150 nm. With single-electron
scattering energy may be transferred to single elec-
trons (rather than to the large number ³10
5involved
in plasmon excitation) by the incident fast electrons.
Lightly-bound valency electrons may be ejected, andthese electrons can be used to form secondary images
in SEM; a very large number of electrons with ener-
gies up to ³50 eV are ejected when a high-energy
electron beam strikes a solid. The useful collisions are
those where the single electron is bound. There is a
minimum energy required to remove the single elec-
tron,i.e.ionization,butprovidedthefastelectrongivesthe bound electron more than this minimum amount,
it can give the bound electron any amount of energy,
up to its own energy (e.g. 100 keV). Thus, instead of
the single-electron excitation process turning up in the
energy loss spectrum of the fast electron as a peak,as happens with plasmon excitation, it turns up as an
edge. Typically, the mean free path for inner shell ion-
ization is several micrometres and the energy loss can
be several keV. The angular half-width of scattering
is given by E/2E
0. Since the energy loss Ecan
vary from ³10 eV to tens of keV the angle can vary
upwards from 10/NUL4radian (see Figure 5.36).
A plasmon, once excited, decays to give heat, which
is not at all useful. In contrast, an atom which has had
anelectronremovedfromitdecaysinoneoftwoways,
both of which turn out to be very useful in chemical
analysis leading to the creation of X-rays and Augerelectrons. The ﬁrst step is the same for both cases. An
electron from outer shell, which therefore has more
energy than the removed electron, drops down to ﬁll
the hole left by the removal of the bound electron. Its
extra energy, E, equal to the difference in energy
between the two levels involved and therefore abso-
lutely characteristic of the atom, must be dissipated.This may happen in two ways: (1) by the creation
of a photon whose energy, h/ETB, equals the energy dif-
ferenceE. For electron transitions of interest, E,
and therefore h/ETB, is such that the photon is an X-ray,
(2) by transferring the energy to a neighbouring elec-tron, which is then ejected from the atom. This is an
‘Auger’ electron. Its energy whendetected willdepend
ontheoriginalenergydifference Eminusthebinding
energy of the ejected electron. Thus the energy of the
Auger electron depends on three atomic levels rather
than two as for emitted photons. The energies of the
Auger electrons are sufﬁciently low that they escapefrom within only about 5 nm of the surface. This is
therefore a surface analysis technique. The ratio of
photon–Auger yield is called the ﬂuorescence ratio ω,
and depends on the atom and the shells involved. For
theK-shell,ωisgivenbyω

tons and Auger electrons emitted. AKis independent

ments and outer shells (L-lines) have lower yields; forK-series transitions ωKvaries from a few per cent for

5.4.2 The transmission electron microscope
(TEM)
Section 5.2.1 shows that to increase the resolving
powerofamicroscopeitisnecessarytoemployshorter
wavelengths. For this reason the electron microscopehas been developed to allow the observation of struc-tures which have dimensions down to less than 1 nm.
An electron microscope consists of an electron gun
and an assembly of lenses all enclosed in an evacuatedcolumn. A very basic system for a transmission elec-tronmicroscopeisshownschematicallyinFigure 5.21.
The optical arrangement is similar to that of the glass
lenses in a projection-type light microscope, althoughit is customary to use several stages of magniﬁcationin the electron microscope. The lenses are usually of
the magnetic type, i.e. current-carrying coils which are
completely surrounded by a soft iron shroud exceptfor a narrow gap in the bore, energized by d.c. and,unlike the lenses in a light microscope, which have
ﬁxed focal lengths, the focal length can be controlled
by regulating the current through the coils of the lens.
Figure 5.21 Schematic arrangement of a basic transmission
electron microscope system .
144Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
This facility compensates for the fact that it is difﬁcult
to move the large magnetic lenses in the evacuatedcolumn of the electron microscope in an analogous
manner to the glass lenses in a light microscope.

and, since normal operating voltages are between 50
and100 kV,thevalueof /NAKusedvariesfrom0.0054 nm
to 0.0035 nm. With a wavelength of 0.005 nm if one
could obtain a value of ⊿/SYNsin˛/triangleleftfor electron lenses
comparable to that for optical lenses, i.e. 1.4, it would
be possible to see the orbital electrons. However, mag-
netic lenses are more prone to spherical and chromaticaberration than glass lenses and, in consequence, small
apertures,whichcorrespondto ˛-valuesofabout0.002
radian, must be used. As a result, the resolution of
the electron microscope is limited to about 0.2 nm. It
will be appreciated, of course, that a variable magni-
ﬁcation is possible in the electron microscope without
relative movement of the lenses, as in a light micro-
scope, because the depth of focus of each image, being
inversely proportional to the square of the numericalaperture, is so great.
5.4.3 The scanning electron microscope
The surface structure of a metal can be studied in the
TEM by the use of thin transparent replicas of the sur-
face topography. Three different types of replica are
in use, (1) oxide, (2) plastic, and (3) carbon replicas.
However, since the development of the scanning elec-
tron microscope (SEM) it is very much easier to study
the surface structure directly.
A diagram of the SEM is shown in Figure 5.22. The
electron beam is focused to a spot ³10 nm diameter
andmadetoscanthesurfaceinaraster.Electronsfrom
the specimen are focused with an electrostatic elec-
trode on to a biased scintillator. The light produced is
transmitted via a Perspexlight pipe to a photomulti-
plier and the signal generated is used to modulate the
brightness of an oscilloscope spot which traverses a
raster in exact synchronism with the electron beam at

thespecimensurface.Theimageobservedontheoscil-
loscope screen is similar to the optical image and the
specimenisusuallytiltedtowardsthecollectoratalowangle⊿<30
°/triangleleftto the horizontal, for general viewing.
As initially conceived, the SEM used backscat-
tered electrons (with E³30 kV which is the inci-
dent energy) and secondary electrons ( E³100 eV)
which are ejected from the specimen. Since the sec-ondary electrons are of low energy they can be bentround corners and give rise to the topographic con-
trast. The intensity of backscattered (BS) electrons is
proportional to atomic number but contrast from theseelectronstendstobeswampedbecause,beingofhigherenergy, they are not so easily collected by the normalcollector system used in SEMs. If the secondary elec-
trons are to be collected a positive bias of ³200 V is
applied to the grid in front of the detector; if only theback-scattered electrons are to be collected the grid isbiased negatively to ³200 V.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant development in recent
years has been the gathering of information relating to
chemical composition. As discussed in Section 5.4.1,materials bombarded with high-energy electrons cangive rise to the emissions of X-rays characteristic of
the material being bombarded. The X-rays emitted
when the beam is stopped on a particular region ofthe specimen may be detected either with a solid-state (Li-drifted silicon) detector which produces avoltage pulse proportionalto the energy of the incident
photons (energy-dispersive method) or with an X-ray
spectrometer to measure the wavelength and intensity(wavelength-dispersive method). The microanalysis of
The characterization of materials 145
materials is presented in Section 5.4.5. Alternatively,
if the beam is scanned as usual and the intensity of theX-ray emission, characteristic of a particular element,
is used to modulate the CRT, an image showing the
distributionofthatelementinthesamplewillresult.X-
ray images are usually very ‘noisy’ because the X-ray
production efﬁciency is low, necessitating exposures athousand times greater than electron images.
Collection of the back-scattered (BS) electrons with
a specially located detector on the bottom of the lens
system gives rise to some exciting applications and
opens up a completely new dimension for SEM frombulk samples. The BS electrons are very sensitive to
atomic number Z and hence are particularly impor-
tant in showing contrast from changes of composi-
tion, as illustrated by the image from a silver alloy
in Figure 5.23. This atomic number contrast is par-ticularly effective in studying alloys which normallyare difﬁcult to study because they cannot be etched.
The intensity of back-scattered electrons is also sen-sitive to the orientation of the incident beam relative
to the crystal. This effect will give rise to ‘orienta-
tion’ contrast from grain to grain in a polycrystalline
specimen as the scan crosses several grains. In addi-
tion, the effect is also able to provide crystallographicinformation from bulk specimens by a process known
as electron channelling. As the name implies, the elec-
trons are channelled between crystal planes and the
amount of channelling per plane depends on its pack-
ing and spacing. If the electron beam impinging on acrystal is rocked through a large angle then the amount
of channelling will vary with angle and hence the BS
image will exhibit contrast in the form of electron
channellingpatternswhichcanbeusedtoprovidecrys-
tallographicinformation.Figure 5.24showsthe‘orien-tation’or channellingcontrastexhibitedby a Fe–3%Si

specimen during secondary recrystallization (a process
used for transformer lamination production) and thechannelling pattern can be analysed to show that the
new grain possesses the Goss texture. Electron chan-
nelling occurs only in relatively perfect crystals and
hence the degradation of electron channelling patterns
may be used to monitor the level of plastic strain, for
example to map out the plastic zone around a fatigue
crack as it develops in an alloy.
The electron beam may also induce electrical effects
which are of importance particularly in semiconductor
materials. Thus a 30 kV electron beam can generate
some thousand excess free electrons and the equiv-
alent number of ions (‘holes’), the vast majority of
which recombine. In metals, this recombination pro-
cess is very fast (1 ps) but in semiconductors may be afew secondsdependingonpurity.Theseexcesscurrent
carriers will have a large effect on the limited conduc-
tivity. Also the carriers generated at one point will
diffuse towards regions of lower carrier concentration
and voltages will be established whenever the carriers
encounter regions of different chemical composition
(e.g. impurities around dislocations). The conductiv-ity effect can be monitored by applying a potential
difference across the specimen from an external bat-
tery and using the magnitude of the resulting current
to modulate the CRT brightness to give an image of
conductivity variation.
The voltage effect arising from different carrier con-
centrations or from accumulation of charge on an insu-lator surface or from the application of an external
electromotive force can modify the collection of the
emitted electrons and hence give rise to voltage con-
trast.Similarly,amagneticﬁeldarisingfromferromag-
netic domains, for example, will affect the collection
efﬁciency of emitted electrons and lead to magnetic
ﬁeld contrast.
The secondary electrons, i.e. lightly-boundelectrons
ejected from the specimen which give topographical
information, are generated by the incident electrons,
by the back-scattered electrons and by X-rays. The
resolution is typically ³10 nm at 20 kV for medium
atomic weight elements and is limited by spreading
of electrons as they penetrate into the specimen. Theback-scattered electrons are also inﬂuenced by beam
spreading and for a material of medium atomic weight
theresolutionis ³100 nm.Thespecimencurrentmode
is limited both by spreading of the beam and the noise
of electronic ampliﬁcation to a spatial resolution of
500 nm and somewhat greater values ³1

the beam-induced conductivity and X-ray modes.
5.4.4 Theoretical aspects of TEM
5.4.4.1 Imaging and diffraction
Although the examination of materials may be carried
out with the electron beam impinging on the surface at
a ‘glancing incidence’, most electron microscopes are
aligned for the use of a transmission technique, since
added information on the interior of the specimen maybe obtained.In consequence,the thicknessofthemetal
specimen has to be limited to below a micrometre,
because of the restricted penetration power of theelectrons. Three methods now in general use for
preparing such thin ﬁlms are (1) chemical thinning,
(2) electropolishing, and (3) bombarding with a beamof ions at a potential of about 3 kV. Chemical thinning
has the disadvantage of preferentially attacking either
the matrix or the precipitated phases, and so theelectropolishing technique is used extensively to
prepare thin metal foils. Ion beam thinning is quite
slow but is the only way of preparing thin ceramicand semiconducting specimens.
Transmission electron microscopy provides both
image and diffraction information from the same smallvolume down to 1
µm in diameter. Ray diagrams for
the two modes of operation, imaging and diffrac-
tion, are shown in Figure 5.25. Diffraction contrast1
is the most common technique used and, as shown
in Figure 5.25a, involves the insertion of an objectiveaperture in the back focal plane, i.e. in the plane in
which the diffraction pattern is formed, to select either
the directly-transmitted beam or a strong diffractedbeam. Images obtained in this way cannot possi-
bly contain information concerning the periodicity of
Figure 5.25 Schematic ray diagrams for (a) imaging and
(b) diffraction .
1Another imaging mode does allow more than one beam to
interfere in the image plane and hence crystal periodicity
can be observed; the larger the collection angle, which isgenerally limited by lens aberrations, the smaller theperiodicity that can be resolved. Interpretation of this direct
imaging mode, while apparently straightforward, is still
controversial, and will not be covered here.
The characterization of materials 147
the crystal, since this information is contained in the
spacing of diffraction maxima and the directions of
diffracted beams, information excluded by the objec-tive aperture.
Variations in intensity of the selected beam is the
only information provided. Such a mode of imaging,carried out by selecting one beam in TEM, is unusual
and the resultant images cannot be interpreted simply
as high-magniﬁcation images of periodic objects. Informulatingasuitabletheoryitisnecessarytoconsiderwhat factors can inﬂuence the intensity of the directly-transmitted beam and the diffracted beams. The obvi-ous factors are (1) local changes in scattering factor,
e.g. particles of heavy metal in light metal matrix,
(2) localchanges inthickness,(3) localchanges inori-entation of the specimen, or (4) discontinuities in thecrystal planes which give rise to the diffracted beams.Fortunately, the interpretation of any intensity changes
is relatively straightforward if it is assumed that there
is only one strong diffracted beam excited. Moreover,since this can be achieved quite easily experimentally,by orienting the crystal such that strong diffractionoccurs from only one set of crystal planes, virtuallyall TEM is carried out with a two-beam condition:
a direct and a diffracted beam. When the direct, or
transmitted, beam only is allowed to contribute tothe ﬁnal image by inserting a small aperture in theback focal plane to block the strongly diffracted ray,then contrast is shown on a bright background and isknown as bright-ﬁeld imaging. If the diffracted ray
only is allowed through the aperture by tilting the
incident beam then contrast on a dark background isobserved and is known as dark-ﬁeld imaging. Thesetwo arrangements are shown in Figure 5.26.
Adislocationcan be seenintheelectronmicroscope
becauseitlocallychangestheorientationofthecrystal,
thereby altering the diffracted intensity. This is illus-
trated in Figure 5.27. Any region of a grain or crystalwhich is not oriented at the Bragg angle, i.e. /DC2>/DC2
B,
is not strongly diffracting electrons. However, in thevicinity of the dislocation the lattice planes are tiltedsuch that locally the Bragg law is satisﬁed and then

and (b) dark-ﬁeld image formation .

strong diffraction arises from near the defect. These
diffracted rays are blocked by the objective apertureand prevented from contributing to the ﬁnal image.The dislocationtherefore appears as a dark line (whereelectrons have been removed) on a bright backgroundin the bright-ﬁeld picture.
The success of transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) is due, to a great extent, to the fact that it is
possibleto deﬁne the diffraction conditionswhich give
rise to the dislocation contrast by obtaining a diffrac-tion pattern from the same small volume of crystal (assmall as 1
µm diameter) as that from which the elec-
tron micrograph is taken. Thus, it is possible to obtainthe crystallographic and associated diffraction infor-mation necessary to interpret electron micrographs. Toobtain a selected area diffraction pattern (SAD) anaperture is inserted in the plane of the ﬁrst image sothat only that part of the specimen which is imagedwithintheaperturecancontributetothediffractionpat-tern. The power of the diffraction lens is then reducedso that the back focal plane of the objective is imaged,
and then the diffraction pattern, which is focused in
this plane, can be seen after the objective aperture isremoved.
The usual type of transmission electron diffraction
pattern from a single crystal region is a cross-gratingpattern of the form shown in Figure 5.28. The simpleexplanation of the pattern can be given by considering

the reciprocal lattice and reﬂecting sphere construc-
tion commonly used in X-ray diffraction. In electrondiffraction, the electron wavelength is extremely short(/NAKD0.0037 nm at 100 kV) so that the radius of the
Ewald reﬂecting sphere is about 2 .5n m
/NUL1,w h i c hi s
about 50 times greater than g, the reciprocal lattice
vector. Moreover, because /NAKis small the Bragg angles
are also small (about 10/NUL2radian or1
2°for low-order
reﬂections) and hence the reﬂection sphere may be
considered as almost planar in this vicinity. If the elec-tron beam is closely parallel to a prominent zone axisof the crystal then several reciprocal points (somewhatextended because of the limited thickness of the foil)will intersect the reﬂecting sphere, and a projection of
the prominentzone inthe reciprocal lattice isobtained,
i.e. the SAD pattern is really a photograph of a recip-rocal lattice section. Figure 5.28 shows some standardcross-grating for fcc crystals. Because the Bragg angle
for reﬂection is small ⊿³
1
2°/triangleleftonly those lattice planes
which are almost vertical, i.e. almost parallel to the
direction of the incident electron beam, are capable
of Bragg-diffracting the electrons out of the objective
aperture and giving rise to image contrast. Moreover,because the foil is buckled or purposely tilted, onlyone family of the various sets of approximately ver-tical lattice planes will diffract strongly and the SADpattern will then show only the direct beam spot andone strongly diffracted spot (see insert Figure 5.40).The indices gof the crystal planes ⊿hkl/triangleleftwhich are
set at the Bragg angle can be obtained from the SAD.Often the planes are near to, but not exactly at, theBraggangleanditisnecessarytodeterminetheprecisedeviation which is usually represented by the param-
eter s, as shown in the Ewald sphere construction in
Figure 5.29. The deviation parameter sis determined
from Kikuchi lines, observed in diffraction patternsobtainedfromsomewhatthickerareasofthespecimen,which form a pair of bright and dark lines associatedwith each reﬂection, spaced jgjapart.
The Kikuchi lines arise from inelastically-scattered
rays, originating at some point Pin the specimen (see
Figure 5.30), being subsequently Bragg-diffracted.Thus, for the set of planes in Figure 5.30a, thoseelectrons travelling in the directions PQ and PR willbe Bragg-diffracted at Q and R and give rise to raysin the directions QQ
0and RR0. Since the electrons
in the beam RR0originate from the scattered ray

contains electrons scattered through a smaller angle at
P. Because P is a spherical source this rediffraction atpoints such as Q and R gives rise to cones of rayswhich, when they intersect the ﬁlm, approximate tostraight lines.
The selection of the diffracting conditions used
to image the crystal defects can be controlled using
Kikuchi lines. Thus the planes ⊿hkl/triangleleftare at the Bragg
angle when the corresponding pair of Kikuchi linespasses through 000 and g

specimen so that this condition is maintained (whichcan be done quite simply, using modern double-tiltspecimen stages) enables the operator to select a spec-
imen orientation with a close approximation to two-
beam conditions. Tilting the specimen to a particularorientation, i.e. electron beam direction, can also beselected using the Kikuchi lines as a ‘navigational’aid. The series of Kikuchi lines make up a Kikuchimap, as shown in Figure 5.30b, which can be used to

tilt from one pole to another (as one would use an
Underground map).
5.4.4.2 Convergent beam diffraction patterns
When a selected area diffraction pattern is taken with
a convergent beam of electrons, the resultant pattern
contains additional structural information. A ray dia-gram illustrating the formation of a convergent beam
diffraction pattern (CBDP) is shown in Figure 5.31a.
The discs of intensity which are formed in the backfocalplanecontaininformationwhichisofthreetypes:
1. Fringes within discs formed by strongly diffracted
beams. If the crystal is tilted to 2-beam conditions,
these fringescan be used todetermine thespecimen
thickness very accurately.2. High-angle information in the form of ﬁne lines
(somewhat like Kikuchi lines) which are visiblein the direct beam and in the higher-order Laue
zones(HOLZ). TheseHOLZare visibleina pattern
covering a large enough angle in reciprocal space.
The ﬁne line pattern can be used to measure the
lattice parameter to 1 in 10

an example of HOLZ lines for a silicon crystal
centred [111]. Pairing a dark line through the zero-
orderdiscwithitscorrespondingbrightlinethrough
the higher-order disc allows the lattice parameter tobe determined, the distance between the pair being
sensitive to the temperature, etc.
3. Detailed structure both within the direct beam and
within the diffracted beams which show certain
well-deﬁned symmetries when the diffraction pat-
ternistakenpreciselyalonganimportantzone axis.
The patterns can therefore be used to give crystal
structure information, particularly the point group
and space group. This information, together with
the chemical composition from EELS or EDX, and
the size of the unit cell from the indexed diffractionpatterns can be used to deﬁne the speciﬁc crys-
tal structure, i.e. the atomic positions. Figure 5.31c
indicates the threefold symmetry in a CBDP from
silicon taken along the [111] axis.
5.4.4.3 Higher-voltage electron microscopy
The most serious limitation of conventional transmis-sionelectronmicroscopes(CTEM)isthelimitedthick-
nessofspecimensexamined(50–500 nm).Thismakes
preparation of samples from heavy elements difﬁcult,
gives limited containment of particles and other struc-
tural features within the specimen, and restricts the
study of dynamical processes such as deformation,annealing, etc., within the microscope. However, the
usable specimen thickness is a function of the acceler-
ating voltage and can be increased by the use of higher
voltages. Because of this, higher-voltage microscopes
(HVEM) have been developed.
The electron wavelength /NAKdecreases rapidly with
voltage and at 1000 kV the wavelength /NAK³0.001 nm.
The decrease in /NAKproduces corresponding decreases
in the Bragg angles /DC2, and hence the Bragg angles at
1000 kV are only about one third of their correspond-
ing values at 100 kV. One consequence of this is thatan additionalprojectorlensisusuallyincludedinhigh-
voltage microscope. This is often called the diffraction
lens and its purpose is to increase the diffraction cam-
era length so that the diffraction spots are more widely
spaced on the photographic plate.
The principal advantages of HVEM are: (1) an
increase in usable foil thickness and (2) a reduced ion-
ization damage rate in ionic, polymer and biological
specimens.Therangeofmaterialsisthereforewidened
and includes (1) materials which are difﬁcult to pre-
pare as thin foils, such as tungsten and uranium and
(2) materials in which the defect being studied is too
large to be conveniently included within a 100 kV

specimen; these include large voids, precipitates and
some dislocation structures such as grain boundaries.
Many processes such as recrystallization, defor-
mation, recovery, martensitic transformation, etc. are
dominated by the effects of the specimen surfaces inthin samples and the use of thicker foils enables these
phenomena to be studied as they occur in bulk mate-
rials. With thicker foils it is possible to construct intri-cate stages which enable the specimen to be cooled,heated, strained and exposed to various chemical envi-
ronments while it is being looked through.
AdisadvantageofHVEMisthatasthebeamvoltage
is raised the energy transferred to the atom by the
fast electron increases until it becomes sufﬁcient to
eject the atom from its site. The amount of energytransferred from one particle to another in a collision
dependsontheratioofthetwomasses(seeChapter 4).
Because the electron is very light compared with anatom, the transfer of energy is very inefﬁcient and the
electron needs to have several hundred keV before it
can transmit the 25 eV or so necessary to displace anatom. To avoid radiation damage it is necessary to
keep the beam voltage below the critical displacement
value which is ³100 kV for Mg and ³1300 kV for
Au. There is, however, much basic scientiﬁc interest
in radiation damage for technological reasons and a
HVEM enables the damage processes to be studieddirectly.
5.4.5 Chemical microanalysis
5.4.5.1 Exploitation of characteristic X-rays
Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) of bulk sam-
ples is now a routine technique for obtaining rapid,accurate analysis of alloys. A small electron probe
(³100 nm diameter) is used to generate X-rays from
a deﬁned area of a polished specimen and the inten-sityofthevariouscharacteristicX-raysmeasuredusingeither wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS) or
energy-dispersive spectrometers (EDS). Typically theaccuracy of the analysis is š0.1%. One of the lim-
itations of EPMA of bulk samples is that the vol-
ume of the sample which contributes to the X-ray
signal is relatively independent of the size of theelectron probe, because high-angle elastic scattering
of electrons within the sample generates X-rays (see
Figure 5.32).Theconsequenceofthisisthatthespatialresolution of EPMA is no better than ¾2
µm. In the
last few years EDX detectors have been interfaced to
transmission electron microscopes which are capable
of operating with an electron probe as small as 2 nm.The combination of electron-transparent samples, inwhich high-angle elastic scattering is limited, and a
smallelectronprobeleadstoasigniﬁcantimprovement
in the potential spatial resolution of X-ray microanal-ysis. In addition, interfacing of energy loss spectrom-
eters has enabled light elements to be detected and
measured, so that electron microchemical analysis isnow a powerful tool in the characterization of materi-als. With electron beam instrumentation it is required
to measure (1) the wavelength or energies of emitted
X-rays (WDX and EDX), (2) the energy losses of thefast electrons (EELS), and (3) the energies of emittedelectrons (AES). Nowadays (1) and (2) can be carried
outonthemodernTEMusingspecialdetectorsystems,
as shown schematically in Figure 5.33.
In a WDX spectrometer a crystal of known d-
spacing is used which diffracts X-rays of a spe-
ciﬁc wavelength, /NAK, at an angle /DC2, given by the
Bragg equation, n/NAKD2dsin/DC2. Different wavelengths
are selected by changing /DC2and thus to cover the neces-
sary range of wavelengths, several crystals of different
d-spacings are used successively in a spectrometer.
The range of wavelength is 0.1–2.5 nm and the corre-sponding d-spacing for practicable values of /DC2,w h i c h

tal of radius 2 rand the detector all lie on the focusing

lected by the detector by setting the crystal at different
angles, /DC2. The operation of the spectrometer is very
time-consuming since only one particular X-ray wave-length can be focused on to the detector at any onetime.
The resolution of WDX spectrometers is controlled
by the perfection of the crystal, which inﬂuences therange of wavelengths over which the Bragg condition
issatisﬁed,andbythesizeoftheentranceslittotheX-
raydetector;takingtheresolution ⊿/NAK/triangleleftto¾0.001 nmthen /NAK//NAKis about 300 which, for a medium atomic
weight sample, leads to a peak–background ratio ofabout 250. The crystal spectrometer normally uses aproportional counter to detect the X-rays, producing
an electrical signal, by ionization of the gas in the
counter,proportionaltotheX-rayenergy,i.e.inverselyproportional to the wavelength. The window of thecounter needs to be thin and of low atomic numberto minimize X-ray absorption. The output pulse from
the counter is ampliﬁed and differentiated to produce a
short pulse. The time constant of the electrical circuitis of the order of 1
µs which leads to possible count
rates of at least 105/s.
In recent years EDX detectors have replaced WDX
detectors on transmission microscopes and are usedtogether with WDX detectors on microprobes and onSEMs. A schematic diagram of a Si–Li detector isshown in Figure 5.34. X-rays enter through the thin
Be window and produce electron-hole pairs in the
Si–Li. Each electron-hole pair requires 3.8 eV, at theoperating temperature of the detector, and the numberof pairs produced by a photon of energy E
pis thus
Ep/3.8.ThechargeproducedbyatypicalX-rayphoton
is³10/NUL16C and this is ampliﬁed to give a shaped
pulse, the height of which is then a measure of the
energy of the incident X-ray photon. The data arestored in a multi-channel analyser. Provided that theX-ray photons arrive with a sufﬁcient time intervalbetween them, the energy of each incident photon canbe measured and the output presented as an intensity
versus energy display. The ampliﬁcation and pulse
shaping takes about 50
µs and if a second pulse arrives
beforetheprecedingpulseisprocessed,bothpulsesarerejected. This results in signiﬁcant dead time for countrates½4000/s.
The number of electron-hole pairs generated by an
X-ray of a given energy is subject to normal statisti-
cal ﬂuctuations and this, taken together with electronicnoise, limits the energy resolution of a Si–Li detec-tor to about a few hundred eV, which worsens withincrease in photon energy. The main advantage of
EDX detectors is that simultaneous collection of the
whole range of X-rays is possible and the energy char-acteristics of all the elements >ZD11 in the Periodic
Tablecan beobtainedinamatter ofseconds.Themain

152Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
disadvantages are the relatively poor resolution, which
leads to a peak-background ratio of about 50, and thelimited count rate.
The variation in efﬁciency of a Si–Li detector must
be allowed for when quantifying X-ray analysis. At
low energies ( /DC41 kV) the X-rays are mostly absorbed
in the Be window and at high energies ( ½20 kV), the
X-rays pass through the detector so that the decreasingcross-section for electron-hole pair generation resultsin a reduction in efﬁciency. The Si–Li detector thus
has optimum detection efﬁciency between about 1 and
20 kV.
5.4.5.2 Electron microanalysis of thin foils
There are several simpliﬁcations which arise from the
use of thin foils in microanalysis. The most important
of these arises from the fact that the average energyloss which electrons suffer on passing through a thinfoil is only about 2%, and this small average lossmeans that the ionization cross-section can be taken
as a constant. Thus the number of characteristic X-
ray photons generated from a thin sample is givensimply by the product of the electron path length andthe appropriate cross-section Q, i.e. the probability of
ejecting the electron, and the ﬂuorescent yield ω.T h e
intensity generated by element A is then given by
I
ADiQωn
where Qis the cross-section per cm2for the particular
ionization event, ωthe ﬂuorescent yield, nthe number
of atoms in the excited volume, and ithe current inci-
dent on the specimen. Microanalysis is usually carriedoutunderconditionswhere thecurrent isunknownandinterpretation of the analysis simply requires that the
ratio of the X-ray intensitiesfrom the various elements
be obtained. For the simple case of a very thin speci-men for which absorption and X-ray ﬂuorescence canbe neglected, then the measured X-ray intensity fromelement A is given by
I
A/nAQAωAaA/DC1A
and for element B by

where n, Q, ω, a and/DC1represent the number of atoms,

A and B. Thus in the alloy made up of elements A

This equation forms the basis for X-ray microanaly-
sis of thin foils where the constant KABcontains all
the factors needed to correct for atomic number differ-
ences, and is knownasthe Z-correction. Thusfrom themeasured intensities, the ratio of the number of atomsA to the number of atoms B, i.e. the concentrations of
A and B in an alloy, can be calculated using the com-
puted values for Q, ω, /DC1, etc. A simple spectrum for
stoichiometric NiAl is shown in Figure 5.35 and the
values of I

K, obtained after stripping the back-
ground, are given in Table 5.2 together with the ﬁnalanalysis. The absolute accuracy of any X-ray analysisdepends either on the accuracy and the constants Q, ω,
etc. or on the standards used to calibrate the measured
intensities.
If the foil is too thick then an absorption
correction (A) may have to be made to the measuredintensities, since in traversing a given path length
to emerge from the surface of the specimen, the X-
rays of different energies will be absorbed differently.This correction involves a knowledge of the specimenthicknesswhichhastobedeterminedbyoneofvarious
techniques but usually from CBDPs. Occasionally
a ﬂuorescence (F) correction is also needed sinceelement ZC2. This ‘nostandards’ Z(AF) analysis can
given an overall accuracy of ³2% and can be carried
out on-line with laboratory computers.
5.4.6 Electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS)
A disadvantage of EDX is that the X-rays from the
light elements are absorbed in the detector window.
Windowless detectors can be used but have somedisadvantages, such as the overlapping of spectrumlines, which have led to the development of EELS.
EELS is possible only on transmission specimens,
and so electron spectrometers have been interfaced
to TEMs to collect all the transmitted electrons lyingwithin a cone of width ˛. The intensity of the various
electrons, i.e. those transmitted without loss of energyandthosethathavebeeninelasticallyscatteredandlost
energy, is then obtained by dispersing the electrons
with a magnetic prism which separates spatially theelectrons of different energies.
A typical EELS spectrum illustrated in Figure 5.36
shows three distinct regions. The zero loss peak is
made up from those electrons which have (1) not
been scattered by the specimen, (2) suffered photonscattering ( ³1/40 eV) and (3) elastically scattered.
The energy width of the zero loss peak is causedby the energy spread of the electron source (up to
³2 eV for a thermionic W ﬁlament) and the energy
resolution of the spectrometer (typically a few eV).The second region of the spectrum extends up to about50 eV loss and is associated with plasmon excitations
corresponding to electrons which have suffered one,
two, or more plasmon interactions. Since the typicalmean free path for the generation of a plasmon isabout 50 nm, many electrons suffer single-plasmonlosses and only in specimens which are too thick for
electron loss analysis will there be a signiﬁcant third
plasmon peak. The relative size of the plasmon losspeakandthezerolosspeakcanalsobeusedtomeasurethe foil thickness. Thus the ratio of the probability of

The third region is made up of a continuous back-
ground on which the characteristic ionization lossesare superimposed.

catalysis and other surface chemical reactions, but hasalso been used successfully to determine the chem-istry of fractured interfaces and grain boundaries (e.g.temper embrittlement of steels).
The basic instrumentationinvolves a focusable elec-
tron gun, an electron analyser and a sample supportand manipulation system, all in an ultra-high-vacuumenvironment to minimize adsorption of gases onto thesurface during analysis. Two types of analyser are in
use, a cylindrical mirror analyser (CMA) and a hemi-
spherical analyser (HSA), both of which are of theenergy-dispersive type as for EELS, with the differ-ence that the electron energies are much lower, andelectrostatic rather than magnetic ‘lenses’ are used toseparate out the electrons of different energies.
In the normal distribution the Auger electron peaks
appear small on a large and often sloping background,which gives problems in detecting weak peaks sinceampliﬁcation enlarges the background slope as wellas the peak. It is therefore customary to differentiate
the spectrum so that the Auger peaks are emphasized
as doublet peaks with a positive and negative displace-ment againsta nearlyﬂat background.Thisis achievedby electronic differentiation by applying a small a.c.signal of a particular frequency in the detected signal.Chemical analysis through the outer surface layers canbecarriedoutbydepthproﬁlingwithanargonion gun.
5.5 Observation of defects
5.5.1 Etch pitting
Since dislocations are regions of high energy, their
presence can be revealed by the use of an etchant
whichchemicallyattackssuchsitespreferentially.Thismethod has been applied successfully in studyingmetals, alloys and compounds, and there are manyﬁne examples in existence of etch-pit patterns show-ing small-angle boundaries and pile-ups. Figure 5.37ashowsanetch-pitpatternfromanarrayofpiled-updis-locations in a zinc crystal. The dislocations are muchcloser together at the head of the pile-up, and an anal-ysis of the array, made by Gilman, shows that theirspacing is in reasonable agreement with the theory of
Eshelby, Frank and Nabarro, who have shown that the
number of dislocations nthat can be packed into a
length Lof slip plane is nD2L/FS//SYNb,w h e r e /FSis the
applied stress. The main disadvantage of the techniqueisitsinabilitytorevealnetworksorotherarrangementsin the interior of the crystal, although some informa-tion can be obtained by taking sections through thecrystal. Its use is also limited to materials with low
dislocation contents ⊿<10
4mm/NUL2/triangleleftbecause of the lim-
ited resolution. In recent years it has been successfullyused to determine the velocity
vof dislocations as a
function of temperature and stress by measuring thedistance travelled by a dislocation after the applicationof a stress for a known time (see Chapter 7).

5.5.2 Dislocation decoration
It is well-known that there is a tendency for solute
atoms to segregate to grain boundaries and, since these
may be considered as made up of dislocations, it is
clear that particular arrangements of dislocations andsub-boundaries can be revealed by preferential precip-
itation. Most of the studies in metals have been carried
out on aluminium –copper alloys, to reveal the dislo-
cations at the surface, but recently several decoration
techniques have been devised to reveal internal struc-
tures. The original experiments were made by Hedgesand Mitchell in which they made visible the disloca-tions in AgBr crystals with photographic silver. After
a critical annealingtreatment and exposureto light,the
colloidal silver separates along dislocation lines. Thetechniquehassincebeenextendedtootherhalides,and
to silicon where the decoration is produced by diffus-
ing copper into the crystal at 900
°C so that on cooling
the crystal to room temperature, the copper precipi-
tates. When the silicon crystal is examined optically,
using infrared illumination, the dislocation-free areastransmittheinfraredradiation,butthedislocationsdec-
orated with copper are opaque. A ﬁne example of
dislocations observed using this technique is shownin Figure 5.37b.The technique of dislocation decoration has the
advantage of revealing internal dislocation networks
but, when used to study the effect of cold-work on the
dislocation arrangement, suffers the disadvantage of
requiring some high-temperature heat-treatment dur-
ing which the dislocation con ﬁguration may become
modiﬁed.
5.5.3 Dislocation strain contrast in TEM
The most notable advance in the direct observation of
dislocationsinmaterials hasbeenmade bytheapplica-
tion of transmission techniques to thin specimens. The
technique has been used widely because the disloca-tion arrangements inside the specimen can be studied.
It is possible, therefore, to investigate the effects of
plastic deformation, irradiation, heat-treatment, etc. on
the dislocation distribution and to record the move-
ment of dislocationsby takingcine- ﬁlms of the images
on theﬂuorescent screen of the electron microscope.
One disadvantage of the technique is that the materi-alshavetobethinnedbeforeexaminationand,because
the surface-to-volume ratio of the resultant specimen
is high, it is possible that some rearrangement of dis-
locations may occur.
A theory of image contrast has been developed
whichagreeswellwithexperimentalobservations.The
156Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
basic idea is that the presence of a defect in the lattice
causes displacements of the atoms from their position
in the perfect crystal and these lead to phase changesin the electron waves scattered by the atoms so thatthe amplitude diffracted by a crystal is altered. Theimage seen in the microscope represents the electronintensity distribution at the lower surface of the speci-men. This intensity distribution has been calculated byadynamicaltheory(seeSection 5.5.7)whichconsidersthe coupling between the diffracted and direct beamsbut it is possible to obtain an explanation of manyobserved contrast effects using a simpler (kinematical)
theory in which the interactions between the transmit-
ted and scattered waves are neglected. Thus if an elec-tron wave, represented by the function exp ⊿2/EMik

reciprocal lattice vector of the lattice plane giving rise
to reﬂection and sis the vector indicating the devia-
tion of the reciprocal lattice point from the reﬂectionsphere (see Figure 5.39). To obtain the total scatteredamplitude from a crystal it is necessary to sum all thescattered amplitudes from all the atoms in the crys-tal, i.e. take account of all the different path lengthsfor rays scattered by different atoms. Since most ofthe intensity is concentrated near the reciprocal latticepoint it is only necessary to calculate the amplitudediffracted by a column of crystal in the direction ofthe diffracted by a column of crystal in the direction
of the diffracted beam and not the whole crystal, as
shown in Figure 5.38. The amplitude of the diffractedbeam/RS

from which it is evident that the diffracted intensity
oscillates with depth zin the crystal with a periodicity
equal to 1/s. The maximum wavelength of this oscil-
lation is known as the extinction1distance/CANgsince the
diffracted intensity is essentially extinguished at suchpositions in the crystal. This sinusoidal variation ofintensity gives rise to fringes in the electron-opticalimage of boundaries and defects inclined to the foilsurface, e.g. a stacking fault on an inclined plane isgenerally visible on an electron micrograph as a setof parallel fringes running parallel to the intersec-tion of the fault plane with the plane of the foil (seeFigure 5.43).
In an imperfect crystal, atoms are displaced from
their true lattice positions. Consequently, if an atomatr
nis displaced by a vector R,the amplitude of
the wave diffracted by the atom is multiplied by
1/CANgD/EMVcos/DC2//NAKFwhereVis the volume of the unit cell,

5.5.4 Contrast from crystals
In general, crystals observed in the microscope appear
light because of the good transmission of electrons. Indetail, however, the foils are usually slightly buckled
so that the orientation of the crystal relative to the
electron beam varies from place to place, and if one
part ofthe crystalis orientedat theBragg angle, strong
diffraction occurs. Such a local area of the crystalthen appears dark under bright-ﬁeld illuminations, and
is known as a bend or extinction contour. If the
specimen is tilted while under observation, the angular
conditions for strong Bragg diffraction are altered, and
the extinction contours, which appear as thick darkbands, can be made to move across the specimen. To
interpret micrographs correctly, it is essential to know
the correct sense of both gands.T h eg-vector is the
line joining the origin of the diffraction pattern to the
strongdiffractionspotanditisessentialthatitssenseiscorrect with respect to the micrograph, i.e. to allow for
any image inversion or rotation by the electron optics.
The sign ofscan be determined from the position of
the Kikuchi lines with respect to the diffraction spots,
as discussed in Section 5.4.1.
5.5.5 Imaging of dislocations
Image contrast from imperfections arises from the
additional phase factor ˛D2/EMg.Rin the equation for
the diffraction of electrons by crystals. In the case of
dislocations the displacement vector Ris essentially
equal tob, the Burgers vector of the dislocation, since
atoms near the core of the dislocation are displaced
parallel tob. In physical terms, it is easily seen
that if a crystal, oriented off the Bragg condition,
i.e.s6D0, contains a dislocation then on one side
of the dislocation core the lattice planes are tiltedinto the reﬂecting position, and on the other side of
the dislocation the crystal is tilted away from the
reﬂecting position. On the side of the dislocation
in the reﬂecting position the transmitted intensity,
i.e. passing through the objective aperture, will beless and hence the dislocation will appear as a line
in dark contrast. It follows that the image of the
dislocation will lie slightly to one or other side ofthe dislocation core, depending on the sign of (g.b)s.
This is shown in Figure 5.39 for the case where the
crystal is oriented in such a way that the incident beammakes an angle greater than the Bragg angle with
the reﬂecting planes, i.e. s>0. The image occurs on
that side of the dislocation where the lattice rotationbrings the crystal into the Bragg position, i.e. rotates
the reciprocal lattice point onto the reﬂection sphere.
Clearly, if the diffracting conditions change, i.e. gor
schange sign, then the image will be displaced to the
other side of the dislocation core.
The phase angle introduced by a lattice defect is
zero wheng.RD0, and hence there is no contrast, i.e.
the defect is invisible when this condition is satisﬁed.

ments in the direction of its Burgers vector, and hence
becauseRDbsuch a dislocation will be completely
‘invisible’when bliesinthereﬂectingplaneproducing

duces some minor atomic displacements perpendicular
tob, as discussed in Chapter 4, and the displacements
give rise to a slight curvature of the lattice planes. An
edge dislocation is therefore not completely invisible
whenblies in the reﬂecting planes, but usually shows
some evidence of faint residual contrast. In general,

however, a dislocation goes out of contrast when the
reﬂecting plane operating contains its Burgers vector,
and this fact is commonly used to determine the Burg-ers vector. To establish buniquely, it is necessary to
tiltthe foil sothat the dislocationdisappears on at leasttwo different re ﬂections. The Burgers vector must then
be parallel to the direction which is common to thesetwo reﬂecting planes. The magnitude of bis usually

The use of the g.bD0 criterion is illustrated in
Figure 5.40. The helices shown in this micrographhave formed by the condensation of vacancies on toscrew dislocations having their Burgers vector bpar-
allel to the axis of the helix. Comparison of the twopictures in (a) and (b) shows that the effect of tilt-ing the specimen, and hence changing the re ﬂecting
plane, is to make the long helix B in (a) disappearin (b). In detail, the foil has a [001] orientation and

5.5.6 Imaging of stacking faults
Contrast at a stacking fault arises because such a
defect displaces the re ﬂecting planes relative to each
other, above and below the fault plane, as illustrated inFigure 5.41a. In general, the contrast from a stacking
fault will not be uniformly bright or dark as wouldbe the case if it were parallel to the foil surface,but in the form of interference fringes running par-
allel to the intersection of the foil surface with the
plane containing the fault. These appear because thediffracted intensity oscillates with depth in the crystalas discussed. The stacking fault displacement vectorR,d eﬁned as the shear parallel to the fault of the por-
tion of crystal below the fault relative to that above the
fault which is as ﬁxed, gives rise to a phase difference
˛D2/EMg.Rintheelectronwavesdiffractedfrom either

criterion for dislocations and can be used to deduce R.
The invisibility of stacking fault contrast when
g.RD0 is exactly analogous to that of a dislocation
wheng.bD0, namely that the displacement vector is
parallel to the re ﬂecting planes. The invisibility when
g.RD1,2,3,...occurs because in these cases the
vectorRmoves the imaging re ﬂecting planes normal
to themselves by a distance equal to a multiple of thespacing between the planes. From Figure 5.41b it canbe seen that for this condition the re ﬂecting planes are
onceagaininregisteroneithersideofthefault,and,as
a consequence, there is no interference between wavesfrom the crystal above and below the fault.

tations.Theequationsareonlyvalidwhenthecrystalis

sis large. The theory is also only strictly applicable
for foils whose thickness is less than about half an
extinction distance ⊿1
2/CANg/triangleleftand no account is taken of
absorption. The dynamical theory has been developed
to overcome these limitations.
The object of the dynamical theory is to take into
account the interactions between the diffracted and
transmitted waves. Again only two beams are consid-ered, i.e. the transmitted and one diffracted beam, and
experimentally it is usual to orient the specimen in
a double-tilt stage so that only one strong diffractedbeam is excited. The electron wave function is then

of the two waves are continually changing with depth

from one wave to another. This is described by a pair
of coupled ﬁrst-order differential equations linking the
wave amplitudes /RS0and/RSg. Displacement of an atom

ative to the defect, then gives the bright and dark- ﬁeld
images respectively. Figure 5.42 shows the bright- and
dark-ﬁeld intensity pro ﬁles from a stacking fault on an
inclined plane, in full and broken lines, respectively.
A wide variety of defects have been computed, some
of which are summarized below:

g.bD0 is satisﬁed. Similarly, an edge dislocation
will be invisible if g.bD0a n di fg.bðuD0
whereuis a unit vector along the dislocation line
andbðudescribes the secondary displacements
associated with an edge dislocation normal to the
dislocation line and b. The computations also show
that for mixed dislocations and edge dislocations
for whichg.bðu<0.64 the contrast produced will
be so weak as to render the dislocation virtually
invisible. At higher values of g.bðusome contrast
is expected. In addition, when the crystal becomes
signiﬁcantly anisotropic residual contrast can be
observed even for g.bD0.
The image of a dislocation lies to one side of
the core, the side being determined by ⊿g.b/trianglelefts. Thus
the image of a dislocation loop lies totally outside
the core when (using the appropriate convention)
⊿g.b/triangleleftsis positive and inside when ⊿g.b/triangleleftsis neg-
ative. Vacancy and interstitial loops can thus bedistinguished by examining their size after chang-
ing from Cgto/NULg, since these loops differ only in
the sign ofb.

3.Stackingfaults For stackingfaults running from top
to bottom of the foil, the bright- ﬁeld image is sym-
metrical about the centre, whereas the dark- ﬁeld
image is asymmetrical (see Figure 5.42). The topof the foil can thus be determined from the non-complementary nature of the fringes by comparingbright- and dark- ﬁeld images. Moreover, the inten-
sity of the ﬁrst fringe is determined by the signof the phase-factor ˛, such that when ˛is positive
theﬁrst fringe is bright (corresponding to a higher
transmitted intensity) and vice versa on a positivephotographic print.
It is thus possible to distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsicfaultsandanexampleisshowninFigure 5.43for an intrinsic fault on ⊿111/triangleleft. The foil orientation is
[110] and the non-complementary nature of the ﬁrst
fringe between B.F. and D.F. indicates the top of thefoil, marked T. Furthermore, from the B.F. images the
ﬁrst fringe is bright with
111, and dark with 1 11a n d

5.5.8 Weak-beam microscopy
One of the limiting factors in the analysis of defects is
the fact that dislocation images have widths of /CANg/3,
i.e. typically >10.0 nm. It therefore follows that dis-
locations closer together than about 20.0 nm are not

generally resolved. With normal imaging techniques,
the detail that can be observed is limited to a value
about ﬁfty to a hundred times greater than the reso-
lution of the microscope. This limitation can be over-
come by application of the weak-beam technique in
which crystals are imaged in dark-ﬁeld using a very
large deviation parameter s. Under these conditions
the background intensity is very low so that weak
images are seen in very high contrast and the dis-
location images are narrow, ( ³1.5 nm) as shown in
Figure 5.44.Atthelargevalueof susedinweak-beam,
the transfer of energy from the direct to the diffracted
beam is very small, i.e. the crystal is a long way from
the Bragg condition and there is negligible diffraction.
Moreover, it is only very near the core of the dis-
location that the crystal planes are sufﬁciently bent
to cause the Bragg condition to be locally satisﬁed,
i.e. g .⊿dR/dz/triangleleftbe large enough to satisfy the condi-
tion [ sCg.⊿dR/dz/triangleleft]D0. Therefore diffraction takes
place from only a small volume near the centre of the
dislocation, giving rise to narrow images. The abso-lute intensity of these images is, however, very small
even though the signal-to-background ratio is high and
hence long exposures are necessary to record them.
5.6 Specialized bombardment
techniques
5.6.1 Neutron diffraction
The advent of nuclear reactors stimulated the applica-
tion of neutron diffraction to those problems of mate-rials science which could not be solved satisfactorily
by other diffraction techniques. In a conventional pile
the fast neutrons produced by ﬁssion are slowed downby repeated collisions with a ‘moderator’ of graphite
or heavy water until they are slow enough to producefurther ﬁssion. If a collimator is inserted into the pile,
some of these slow neutrons
1will emerge from it in
the form of a beam, and the equivalent wavelength /NAK
of this neutron beam of energy Ein electron-volts is
given by /NAKD0.0081 /E. The equilibrium temperature
in a pile is usually in the range 0–100 °C, which cor-
responds to a peak energy of several hundredths of
an electron-volt. The corresponding wavelength of the
neutron beam is about 0.15 nm and since this is verysimilar to the wavelength of X-rays it is to be expectedthat thermal neutrons will be diffracted by crystals.
The properties of X-ray and neutron beams differ
in many respects. The distribution of energy among
the neutrons in the beam approximately follows theMaxwellian curve appropriate to the equilibrium tem-perature and, consequently,there isnothingwhichcor-responds to characteristic radiation. The neutron beamis analogous to a beam of ‘white’ X-rays, and as a
result it has to be monochromatized before it can be
used in neutron crystallography. Then, because only
about 1 in 10
3of the neutrons in the originally weak
collimated beam are reﬂected from the monochroma-tor, it is necessary to employ very wide beams several
inches in cross-section to achieve a sufﬁciently high
counting rate on the boron triﬂuoride counter detec-tor (photographic detection is possible but not gen-erally useful). In consequence, neutron spectrometers,although similar in principle to X-ray diffractometers,
have to be constructed on a massive scale.
1These may be called ‘thermal’ neutrons because they are
in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings.
162Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Neutron beams do, however, have advantages over
X-rays or electrons, and one of these is the extremelylow absorption of thermal neutrons by most elements.
Table 5.3showsthateveninthemosthighlyabsorbent
elements (e.g. lithium, boron, cadmium and gadolin-ium) the mass absorption coefﬁcients are only of the
sameorderasthoseformostelementsforacomparable
X-ray wavelength, and for other elements the neutron
absorption is very much less indeed. This penetrative
property of the neutron beam presents a wide scopefor neutron crystallography, since the whole body of a
specimen may be examined and not merely its surface.
Problems concerned with preferred orientation, resid-ual stresses, cavitation and structural defects are but
a few of the possible applications, some of which are
discussed more fully later.
Another difference concerns the intensity of scatter-
ing per atom, I
a. For X-rays, where the scattering is by
electrons, the intensity Iaincreases with atomic num-
berandisproportionaltothesquareoftheatomic-form
factor. For neutrons, where the scattering is chieﬂy bythe nucleus, I
aappears to be quite unpredictable. The
scattering power per atom varies not only apparently
at random from atom to atom, but also from isotope
to isotope of the same atom. Moreover, the nuclear
component to the scattering does not decrease withincreasing angle, as it does with X-rays, because the
nucleus which causes the scattering is about 10
/NUL12mm
in size compared with 10/NUL7mm, which is the size of
the electron cloud that scatters X-rays. Table 5.4 gives
some of the scattering amplitudes for X-rays and ther-
mal neutrons.
The fundamental difference in the origin of scat-
tering between X-rays and neutrons affords a methodof studying structures, such as hydrides and carbides,
which contain both heavy and light atoms. When X-
rays are used, the weak intensity contributions of thelight atoms are swamped by those from the heavy
atoms, but when neutrons are used, the scattering
power of all atoms is roughly of the same order.
Similarly, structures made up of atoms whose atomic
numbers are nearly the same (e.g. iron and cobalt, orcopper and zinc), can be studied more easily by using

neutrons. This aspect is discussed later in relation to
the behaviour of ordered alloy phases.
Themajorcontributiontothescatteringpowerarises
from the nuclear component, but there is also an elec-
tronic (magnetic spin) component to the scattering.This arises from the interaction between the mag-netic moment of the neutron and any resultant mag-netic moment which the atom might possess. As aresult, the neutron diffraction pattern from paramag-netic materials, where the atomic moments are ran-domly directed (see Chapter 6), shows a broad diffusebackground, due to incoherent (magnetic) scattering,superimposed on the sharp peaks which arise fromcoherent (nuclear) scattering. In ferromagnetic metalsthe atomic moments are in parallel alignment through-outadomain,sothatthiscauseofincoherentscatteringis absent. In some materials (e.g. NiO or FeO) analignment of the spins takes place, but in this casethe magnetization directions of neighbouring pairs of
atomsinthestructureareopposedand,inconsequence,
cancel each other out. For these materials, termedanti-ferromagnetic, there is no net spontaneous mag-netization and neutron diffraction is a necessary andimportant tool for investigating their behaviour (seeChapter 6).
5.6.2 Synchrotron radiation studies
Very large electrical machines known as synchrotronradiation sources (SRS) provide a unique source of

electromagnetic radiation for materials characterisa-
tion.1Electrons from a hot cathode are accelerated
in three stages by a linear accelerator (Linac), a
booster synchrotron and an evacuated storage ring(Figure 5.45a). As bunches of electrons travel around
the periphery of the storage ring they attain ener-
gies of up to 2 GeV and velocities approaching thatof light. At these relativistic velocities, electron mass
becomes 4000 times greater than the rest mass. Dipole
and quadrupole magnets constrain the bunches intoan approximately circular orbit and, by accelerating
them centripetally, cause electromagnetic radiation to
be produced. The spectrum of this synchrotron radi-ation is very wide, extending from short-wavelength
(‘hard’) X-rays to the infrared range (Figure 5.45b). A
wiggler magnet produces a strong (5 tesla) ﬁeld andcan extend the spectrum to even shorter wavelengths.
Compared with more orthodox sources of electromag-
netic radiation, the synchrotron offers the advantagesof very high intensity, short wavelengths, precise col-
limation of the beam and a smooth, continuous spec-
trum. The high radiation intensity permits exposuretimesthatareoftenseveralordersofmagnitudeshorter
than those for comparable laboratory methods. The
risk of beam damage to specimens by the ﬂashes ofradiation is accordingly lessened. Specimens of met-
als, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, catalysts, etc.
1In 1980, the world’s ﬁrst totally radiation-dedicated SRS

In the technique known as extended X-ray absorp-
tion ﬁne-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) attention is
directed to the small discontinuities on the higher-
energyﬂankbeyondeachvertical,characteristic‘edge’which appears in a plot of mass absorption ver-
sus X-ray wavelength. These ‘ﬁnestructure’ (FS) fea-
tures derive from interference effects between electronwaves from excited atoms and waves back-scattered
from surrounding atoms. Mathematical treatment
(using a Fourier transform) of the EXAFS spectrayields a radial distribution plot of surrounding atomicdensity versus distance from the excited atom. By
selecting the ‘edge’ for a particular type of atom/ion
and studying its ﬁne structure, it is thus possible toobtain information on its local environment and coor-
dination. This type of information is of great value
in structural studies of materials, such as glasses,which only exhibit short-range order. For instance, the
EXAFS technique has demonstrated that the network
structureofSiO
2–Na2O–CaOglassisthreadedbyper-
colation channels of modiﬁer (sodium) cations.
5.6.3 Secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS)
This important and rapidly-developing technique,
which enables material surfaces to be analysed with
great chemical sensitivity and excellent resolution in
164Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
depth, is based upon the well-known phenomenon of
sputtering. The target surface is bombarded with a
focusedbeamofprimaryionsthathasbeenacceleratedwith a potential of 1–30 kV within a high-vacuum
chamber (10
/NUL5–10/NUL10torr). These ions generate a
series of collision cascades in a shallow surface layer,0.5–5 nm deep, causing neutral atoms and, to a muchsmaller extent, secondary ionsto be ejected (sputtered)from the specimen surface. Thus, a metallic oxide
(MO) sample may act as a source of M, O, M
C,OC,
M/NUL,O/NUL,M OCand MO/NULspecies. The secondary ions,
which are thus either monatomic or clustered, positive
or negative, are directed into a mass spectrometer
(analyser), wherein they are sorted and identiﬁedaccording to their mass/charge ratio. Exceptionallyhigh elemental sensitivities, expressed in parts permillion and even parts per billion, are achievable. Allelements in the Periodic Table can be analysed and itis possible to distinguish between individual isotopes.Studies of the self-diffusion of oxygen and nitrogen
have been hindered because these light elements have
no isotopes that can be used as radioactive tracers.
SIMS based on the stable isotope
18O provides a rapid
method for determining self-diffusioncoefﬁcients. The
physical process whereby ions are ejected is difﬁcultto express in rigorous theoretical terms, consequentlySIMS is usually semiquantitative, with dependenceupon calibration with standard samples of knowncomposition. SIMS is a valuable complement to othermethods of surface analysis.
The available range of beam diameter is 1
µmt o
several millimetres. Although various types of ion
beam are available (e.g. Ar/NUL,32O2C,16O/NUL,C sC,e t c . )
positively-charged beams are a common choice. How-ever, if the sample is insulating, positive charge tendsto accumulate in the bombarded region, changing theeffective value of the beam voltage and degrading thequality of signals. One partial remedy, applicable atlowbeamvoltages,isto‘ﬂood’theion-bombardedarea
with a high-intensity electron beam. In some variants
of SIMS laser beams are used instead of ion beams.
Of the large and growing variety of methods
covered by the term SIMS, the dynamic, staticand imaging modes are especially useful. Materialsbeing investigated include metals, ceramics, polymers,catalysts, semiconductors and composites. DynamicSIMS, which uses a relatively high beam current, is an
important method for determining the distribution and
very low concentration of dopants in semiconductors.The beam scans a raster, 100–500
µm in size, and
slowly erodes the surface of the sample. Secondaryions from the central region of the crater are analysedto produce a precise depth proﬁle of concentration.Static SIMS uses a much smaller beam current and theﬁnal spectra tend to be more informative, providing
chemical data on the top few atomic layers of the
sample surface. Little surface damage occurs and themethod has been applied to polymers. The imagingversion of SIMS has a resolution comparable to SEMand provide ‘maps’ that show the lateral distribution
of elements at grain boundaries and precipitated
particles and hydrogen segregation in alloys. ImagingSIMS has been applied to transverse sections through
the complex scale layers which form when alloys
are exposed to hot oxidizing gases (e.g. O
2,C O2).
Its sensitivity is greater than that obtainable with
conventional EDX in SEM analysis and has provided
a better understanding of growth mechanisms and thespecial role of trace elements such as yttrium.
5.7 Thermal analysis
5.7.1 General capabilities of thermal analysis
Heating a material at a steady rate can produce chemi-cal changes, such as oxidation and degradation, and/orphysical changes, such as the glass transition in poly-mers, conversions/inversions in ceramics and phase
changes inmetals. Thermal analysisisused tocomple-
ment X-ray diffraction analysis, optical and electronmicroscopy during the development of new materi-
als and in production control. Sometimes it is used
todeﬁne thetemperatureand energychangeassociatedwith a structural change; at other times it is used quali-
tativelyto providea characteristic ‘ﬁngerprint’ trace of
aparticularmaterial.Thevarioustechniquesofthermalanalysis measure one or more physical properties of asample as a function of temperature. Figure 5.46 illus-
trates three basic methods of thermal analysis, namely
thermogravimetricanalysis(TGA),differentialthermalanalysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). Respectively, they measure change in mass
(TGA) and energy ﬂow (DTA, DSC). They can applyprogrammed heating and cooling, but usually operate
with a slowly rising temperature. The sample chamber
may contain air, oxygen, nitrogen, argon, etc. or beevacuated. A sample of a few tens of milligrams willoften sufﬁce.
Recently-developed methods have extended the
range of thermal analysis and other aspects ofbehaviour can now be studied. For instance,
using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA),
mechanical as well as structural information can beobtained on the viscoelastic response of a polymeric
sampletotensile,bendorshearstressesduringheating.
5.7.2 Thermogravimetric analysis
In a thermobalance the mass of a sample is contin-uously determined and recorded while the sample is
being slowly heated (Figure 5.46a). Temperatures upto at least 1000
°C are available. It has been applied
to the decompositionof rubbers (Figure 5.47a), kinetic
studiesof metallicoxidation,glasstransitionsandsoft-ening in polymers. Equilibrium is not attained withinthe sample and the method is insensitive to the more
subtle solid-state changes. When changes overlap, it
can be helpful to plot the ﬁrst derivative, υm/υt,o f

5.7.3 Differential thermal analysis
DTA1reveals changes during the heating of a sample
which involve evolution or absorption of energy. As
shown diagrammatically in Figure 5.46b, a sample S
andachemicallyandthermallyinertreferencematerialR (sintered alumina or precipitated silica) are mounted
in a recessed heating block and slowly heated. The
thermocouples in S and R are connected in opposi-tion; their temperature difference Tis ampliﬁed and
plottedagainst temperature. Peak area on thistrace is a
function of the change in enthalpy ⊿H/triangleleftas well as the
massandthermalcharacteristicsofthesampleS.Small
samples can be used to give sharper, narrower peaks,providedthattheyarefullyrepresentativeofthesource

version and forerunner of modern DTA used byW. C. Roberts-Austen (1899) in metallurgical studies ofalloys.material. Ideally, the speciﬁc heat capacities of S and
R should be similar. DTA is generally regarded as a
semi-quantitative or qualitative method. It has been
used in studies of devitriﬁcation in oxide glasses andthe glass transition in polymers. Figure 5.47b shows
a comparison of the thermal response of high-alumina
cement (HAC) and Portland cement. The amount of anundesirable weakening phase can be derived from the
relative lengths of the ordinates X and Y in the HAC
trace.
5.7.4 Differential scanning calorimetry
In this method, unlike DTA, the sample and reference
body have separate resistive heaters (Figure 5.46c).
When a difference in temperature develops betweensample S and reference R, an automatic control loop
heats the cooler of the two until the difference is
eliminated. The electrical power needed to accomplishthis equalizer is plotted against temperature. An
endothermic change signiﬁes that an enthalpy increase
has occurred in S; accordingly, its peak is plottedupwards (unlike DTA traces). Differences in thermal
conductivity and speciﬁc heat capacity have no effect

techniques, such as evolved gas analysis (EGA). DSC
has been used in studies of the curing characteristicsof rubbers and thermoset resins, transitions inliquid crystals and isothermal crystallization ratesin thermoplastics. Figure 5.47c is a trace obtainedfor a quenched amorphous polymer. DSC has alsobeen used in studies of the exothermic behaviour ofcold-worked metals as they release ‘stored energy’during annealing, energy absorption during eutecticmelting of alloys, precipitation in aluminium-basedalloys, relaxation transformations in metallic glassesand drying/ﬁring transitions in clay minerals.

The physical properties of materials
6.1 Introduction
The ways in which any material interacts and responds
to various forms of energy are of prime interest to sci-entists and, in the context of engineering, provide theessential base for design and innovation. The energyactingonamaterialmayderivefromforceﬁelds(grav-itational, electric, magnetic), electromagnetic radiation(heat, light, X-rays), high-energy particles, etc. Theresponses of a material, generally referred to as itsphysical properties, are governed by the structuralarrangement of atoms/ions/molecules in the material.The theme of the structure/property relation whichhas run through previous chapters is developed fur-ther. Special attention will be given to the diffusion ofatoms/ions within materials because of the importanceof thermal behaviour during manufacture and service.In this brief examination, which will range from den-sity to superconductivity, the most important physicalproperties of materials are considered.
6.2 Density
This property, deﬁned as the mass per unit volume ofa material, increases regularly with increasing atomicnumbers in each sub-group. The reciprocal of thedensity is the speciﬁc volume
v, while the product of
vand the relative atomic mass Wis known as the
atomic volume /DEL. The density may be determined by
the usual ‘immersion’ method, but it is instructive toshow how X-rays can be used. For example, a powderphotograph may give the lattice parameter of an fcc
metal, say copper, as 0.36 nm. Then 1 /⊿3.6ð10
/NUL10/triangleleft3
or 2.14ð1028cells of this size (0.36 nm) are found
in a cube 1 m edge length. The total number of
atoms in 1 m3is then 4 ð2.14ð1028D8.56ð1028
since an fcc cell contains four atoms. Furthermore,
the mass of a copper atom is 63.57 times the mass
of a hydrogen atom (which is 1 .63ð10/NUL24g) sothat the mass of 1 m3of copper, i.e. the density, is
8.56ð1028ð63.57ð1.63ð10/NUL24D8900 kg m/NUL3.
On alloying, the density of a metal changes. This
is because the mass of the solute atom differs from
that of the solvent, and also because the lattice
parameter usually changes on alloying. The parameterchange may often be deduced from Vegard’s law,
which assumes that the lattice parameter of a solid
solution varies linearly with atomic concentration, butnumerous deviations from this ideal behaviour do
exist.
The density clearly depends on the mass of the
atoms, their size and the way they are packed. Metals
are dense because they have heavy atoms and close
packing; ceramics have lower densities than metalsbecause they contain light atoms, either C, N or O;
polymers have low densities because they consist of
light atoms in chains. Figure 6.1 shows the spread indensity values for the different material classes. Such
‘Material Property Charts’, as developed by Ashby,
are useful when selecting materials during engineer-ing design.

6.3.1 Thermal expansion

the ions sit in a potential well of depth Er0below the
energyofafreeatom(Figure 6.2).Theeffectofraisingthe temperature of the crystal is to cause the ions
to oscillate in this asymmetrical potential well about
their mean positions. As a consequence, this motioncauses the energy of the system to rise, increasing
with increasing amplitude of vibration. The increasing
amplitude of vibration also causes an expansion of thecrystal, since as a result of the sharp rise in energy

the distance ris such that the atoms are no longer
interacting, the material is transformed to the gaseous
phase, and the energy to bring this about is the energy
of evaporation.The change in dimensions with temperature is
usually expressed in terms of the linear coefﬁcient
of expansion ˛,g i v e nb y ˛D⊿1/l/triangleleft⊿dl/dT/triangleleft,w h e r e
lis the original length of the specimen and Tis
the absolute temperature. Because of the anisotropicnature of crystals, the value of ˛usually varies with
the direction of measurement and even in a particular
crystallographic direction the dimensional change withtemperature may not always be uniform.
Phase changes in the solid state are usually studied
bydilatometry . The change in dimensions of a
specimen can be transmitted to a sensitive dial gauge
or electrical transducer by means of a fused silicarod. When a phase transformation takes place, becausethe new phase usually occupies a different volume
to the old phase, discontinuities are observed in the
coefﬁcient of thermal expansion ˛versus Tcurve.
Some of the ‘nuclear metals’ which exist in manyallotropicforms,suchasuraniumandplutonium,showa negative coefﬁcient along one of the crystallographic
axes in certain of their allotropic modiﬁcations.
170Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Thechange in volume withtemperature isimportant
in many metallurgical operations such as casting,welding and heat treatment. Of particular importance
is the volume change associated with the melting
or, alternatively, the freezing phenomenon since thisis responsible for many of the defects, both ofa macroscopic and microscopic size, which existin crystals. Most metals increase their volume byabout 3% on melting, although those metals whichhave crystal structures of lower coordination, such asbismuth, antimony or gallium, contract on melting.This volume change is quite small, and while theliquid structure is more open than the solid structure,it is clear that the liquid state resembles the solidstate more closely than it does the gaseous phase. Forthe simple metals the latent heat of melting, whichis merely the work done in separating the atoms fromtheclose-packedstructureofthesolidtothemoreopenliquid structure, is only about one thirtieth of the latentheat of evaporation, while the electrical and thermalconductivities are reduced only to three-quarters toone-half of the solid state values.
6.3.2 Speciﬁc heat capacity
Thespeciﬁcheat isanotherthermalpropertyimportant
in the processing operations of casting or heattreatment, since it determines the amount of heatrequiredintheprocess.Thus,thespeciﬁcheat(denotedbyC
p, when dealing with the speciﬁc heat at constant
pressure) controls the increase in temperature, d T,
produced by the addition of a given quantity of heat,
dQ, to one gram of matter so that d QDCpdT.
The speciﬁc heat of a metal is due almost entirely
to the vibrational motion of the ions. However, asmall part of the speciﬁc heat is due to the motionof the free electrons, which becomes important athigh temperatures, especially in transition metals withelectrons in incomplete shells.
The classical theory of speciﬁc heat assumes that
an atom can oscillate in any one of three directions,and hence a crystal of Natoms can vibrate in 3 N
independent normal modes, each with its characteristicfrequency. Furthermore, the mean energy of each nor-mal mode will be kT, so that the total vibrational
thermal energy of the metal is ED3NkT. In solid
and liquid metals, the volume changes on heating arevery small and, consequently, it is customary to con-sider the speciﬁc heat at constant volume. If N,t h e
number of atoms in the crystal, is equal to the numberof atoms in a gram-atom (i.e. Avogadro number), theheat capacity per gram-atom, i.e. the atomic heat, atconstant volume is given by

In practice, of course, when the speciﬁc heat is exper-

Dulong and Petit were the ﬁrst to point out that the
speciﬁc heat of most materials, when determined atsufﬁciently high temperatures and corrected to applyto constant volume, is approximately equal to 3 R,
whereRis the gas constant. However, deviations
from the ‘classical’ value of the atomic heat occurat low temperatures, as shown in Figure 6.3a. Thisdeviation is readily accounted for by the quantum
theory, since the vibrational energy must then be
quantized in multiples of h/ETB,w h e r e his Planck’s
constant and /ETBis the characteristic frequency of the
normal mode of vibration.
According to the quantum theory, the mean energy

6.3.3 The speciﬁc heat curve and
transformations
The speciﬁc heat of a metal varies smoothly with tem-
perature, as shown in Figure 6.3a, provided that nophase change occurs. On the other hand, if the metalundergoes a structural transformation the speciﬁc heatcurve exhibits a discontinuity, as shown in Figure 6.4.If the phase change occurs at a ﬁxed temperature, themetal undergoes what is known as a ﬁrst-order trans-formation; for example, the ˛to/CR,/CRtoυandυto liq-
uid phase changes in iron shown in Figure 6.4a. At the
transformation temperature the latent heat is absorbedwithout a rise in temperature, so that the speciﬁc heat
⊿dQ/dT/triangleleftat the transformation temperature is inﬁnite.
In some cases, known as transformations of the sec-ond order, the phase transition occurs over a range
of temperature (e.g. the order–disorder transformation
in alloys), and is associated with a speciﬁc heat peakof the form shown in Figure 6.4b. Obviously the nar-

speciﬁc heat becomes inﬁnite and equal to the latent
heat of transformation. A second-order transformationalso occurs in iron (see Figure 6.4a), and in this case
is due to a change in ferromagnetic properties with
temperature.
6.3.4 Free energy of transformation
In Section 3.2.3.2 it was shown that any structuralchanges of a phase could be accounted for in terms
of the variation of free energy with temperature. The

Equation (6.1) indicates that the free energy of a given
phase decreases more rapidly with rise in tempera-ture the larger its speciﬁc heat. The intersection of thefreeenergy–temperaturecurves,showninFigure 3.9a,
therefore takes place because the low-temperature
phase has a smaller speciﬁc heat than the higher-temperature phase.
At low temperatures the second term in equation
(6.1) is relatively unimportant, and the phase that
is stable is the one which has the lowest valueofH
0, i.e. the most close-packed phase which is
associated with a strong bonding of the atoms.
However, the more strongly bound the phase, the
higher is its elastic constant, the higher the vibrationalfrequency, and consequently the smaller the speciﬁcheat (see Figure 6.3a). Thus, the more weakly bound
structure, i.e. the phase with the higher H
0at low
temperature, is likely to appear as the stable phaseat higher temperatures. This is because the secondterm in equation (6.1) now becomes important and G
decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature,
for the phase with the largest value of
/integraltext⊿Cp/T/triangleleftdT.
From Figure 6.3b it is clear that a large/integraltext⊿Cp/T/triangleleftdT
is associated with a low characteristic temperatureand hence, with a low vibrational frequency such as
is displayed by a metal with a more open structure
and small elastic strength. In general, therefore, whenphase changes occur the more close-packed structure
usually exists at the low temperatures and the more
open structures at the high temperatures. From this
viewpoint a liquid, which possesses no long-range
structure, has a higher entropy than any solid phaseso that ultimately all metals must melt at a sufﬁciently
high temperature, i.e. when the TSterm outweighs the
Hterm in the free energy equation.
The sequence of phase changes in such metals as
titanium, zirconium, etc. is in agreement with this pre-
diction and, moreover, the alkali metals, lithium and
sodium, which are normally bcc at ordinary temper-atures, can be transformed to fcc at sub-zero temper-
atures. It is interesting to note that iron, being bcc
(˛-iron) even at low temperatures and fcc ( /CR-iron) at
high temperatures, is an exception to this rule. In this
case, the stability of the bcc structure is thought to beassociated with its ferromagnetic properties. By hav-
ing a bcc structure the interatomic distances are of the
correct value for the exchange interaction to allow the
electrons to adopt parallel spins (this is a condition for
magnetism). While this state is one of low entropy it isalso one of minimum internal energy, and in the lower
temperature ranges this is the factor which governs the
phase stability, so that the bcc structure is preferred.
Iron is also of interest because the bcc structure,
which is replaced by the fcc structure at temperaturesabove 910
°C, reappears as the υ-phase above 1400 °C.
This behaviour is attributed to the large electronic spe-
ciﬁc heat of iron which is a characteristic feature of
most transition metals. Thus, the Debye characteristic
temperature of /CR-iron is lower than that of ˛-iron and
thisismainlyresponsibleforthe ˛to/CRtransformation.
However, the electronic speciﬁc heat of the ˛-phase
becomes greater than that of the /CR-phase above about
300°C and eventually at higher temperatures becomes
sufﬁcient to bring about the return to the bcc structure
at 1400 °C.
6.4 Diffusion
6.4.1 Diffusion laws
Some knowledge of diffusion is essential in
understanding the behaviour of materials, particularly
at elevated temperatures. A few examples include
such commercially important processes as annealing,
heat-treatment, the age-hardening of alloys, sintering,
surface-hardening, oxidation and creep. Apart fromthe specialized diffusion processes, such as grain
boundary diffusion and diffusion down dislocation
channels, a distinction is frequently drawn between
diffusion in pure metals, homogeneous alloys and
inhomogeneousalloys.Inapurematerialself-diffusioncan be observed by using radioactive tracer atoms.
In a homogeneous alloy diffusion of each component
can also be measured by a tracer method, but in an
inhomogeneous alloy, diffusion can be determined by
chemical analysis merely from the broadening of theinterface between the two metals as a function of time.
The physical properties of materials 173
Figure 6.5 Effect of diffusion on the distribution of solute in
an alloy.
Inhomogeneous alloys are common in metallurgical
practice (e.g. cored solid solutions) and in suchcases diffusion always occurs in such a way as toproduce a macroscopic ﬂow of solute atoms down theconcentrationgradient. Thus,ifa barof analloy,alongwhich there is a concentration gradient (Figure 6.5) isheated for a few hours at a temperature where atomic
migration is fast, i.e. near the melting point, the solute
atoms are redistributed until the bar becomes uniformincomposition.Thisoccurseventhoughtheindividualatomic movements are random, simply because thereare more solute atoms to move down the concentrationgradient than there are to move up. This fact forms thebasis of Fick’s law of diffusion, which is
dn/dtD/NULDdc/dx (6.2)
Here the number of atoms diffusing in unit time
across unit area through a unit concentration gradient
is known as the diffusivity or diffusion coefﬁcient,
1D.
It is usually expressed as units of cm2s/NUL1or m2s/NUL1and
depends on the concentration and temperature of thealloy.
To illustrate, we may consider the ﬂow of atoms
in one direction x, by taking two atomic planes A
and B of unit area separated by a distance b,a s

ﬂow in which the concentration at a point changeswith time, we take two planes A and B, as before,separated by unit distance and consider the rate of

An illustration of the use of the diffusion equations
is the behaviour of a diffusion couple, where thereis a sharp interface between pure metal and an alloy.
Figure 6.5 can be used for this example and as the
solute moves from alloy to the pure metal the way inwhich the concentration varies is shown by the dottedlines. The solution to Fick’s second law is given by

This particular example is important because it can
be used to model the depth of diffusion after timet, e.g. in the case-hardening of steel, providing the
concentration proﬁle of the carbon after a carburizingtimet, or dopant in silicon. Starting with a constant

Diffusion equations are of importance in many diverse
problems and in Chapter 4 are applied to the diffusionof vacancies from dislocation loops and the sinteringof voids.
6.4.2 Mechanisms of diffusion
Thetransportofatomsthroughthelatticemayconceiv-ably occur in many ways. The term ‘interstitial diffu-sion’ describes the situation when the moving atomdoes not lie on the crystal lattice, but instead occu-pies an interstitial position. Such a process is likelyin interstitial alloys where the migrating atom is verysmall (e.g. carbon, nitrogen or hydrogen in iron). Inthis case, the diffusion process for the atoms to movefrom one interstitial position to the next in a perfectlattice is not defect-controlled. A possible variant ofthis type of diffusion has been suggested for substitu-tional solutions in which the diffusing atoms are onlytemporarily interstitial and are in dynamic equilibriumwith others in substitutional positions. However, theenergytoform suchaninterstitialismanytimesthattoproduce a vacancy and, consequently, the most likelymechanism is that of the continual migration of vacan-cies. With vacancy diffusion, the probability that anatom may jump to the next site will depend on: (1) theprobability that the site is vacant (which in turn is pro-portional to the fraction of vacancies in the crystal),and (2) the probability that it has the required activa-tion energy to make the transition. For self-diffusionwhere no complications exist, the diffusion coefﬁcientis therefore given by

DD0exp[/NUL⊿EfCEm/triangleleft/kT] ⊿6.12/triangleleft
The factor fappearing in D0is known as a correla-
tion factor and arises from the fact that any particulardiffusion jump is inﬂuenced by the direction of theprevious jump. Thus when an atom and a vacancyexchange places in the lattice there is a greater prob-ability of the atom returning to its original site thanmoving to another site, because of the presence thereof a vacancy; fis 0.80 and 0.78 for fcc and bcc
lattices, respectively. Values for E

1The entropy factor exp[ ⊿SfCSm/triangleleft/k] is usually taken to be
unity.
The physical properties of materials 175
In alloys, the problem is not so simple and it is
found that the self-diffusion energy is smaller than inpure metals. This observation has led to the sugges-tionthatinalloysthevacanciesassociatepreferentiallywith solute atoms in solution; the binding of vacanciesto the impurity atoms increases the effective vacancy
concentration near those atoms so that the mean jump
rate of the solute atoms is much increased. This asso-ciation helps the solute atom on its way through thelattice,but,conversely, thespeedofvacancy migrationis reduced because it lingers in the neighbourhood ofthe solute atoms, as shown in Figure 6.7. The phe-
nomenon of association is of fundamental importance
in all kinetic studies since the mobility of a vacancythrough the lattice to a vacancy sink will be governedby its ability to escape from the impurity atoms whichtrap it. This problem has been mentioned in Chapter 4.
When considering diffusion in alloys it is impor-
tant to realize that in a binary solution of A and Bthe diffusion coefﬁcients D
AandDBare generally not
equal. This inequality of diffusion was ﬁrst demon-strated by Kirkendall using an ˛-brass/copper couple
(Figure 6.8). He noted that if the position of the inter-
faces of the couple were marked (e.g. with ﬁne W or
Mo wires), during diffusion the markers move towardseach other, showing that the zinc atoms diffuse out ofthe alloy more rapidly than copper atoms diffuse in.This being the case, it is not surprising that severalworkers have shown that porosity develops in such
systems on that side of the interface from which there
is a net loss of atoms.
The Kirkendall effect is of considerable theoretical
importance since it conﬁrms the vacancy mechanismof diffusion. This is because the observations cannoteasily be accounted for by any other postulated
mechanisms of diffusion, such as direct place-
exchange, i.e. where neighbouring atoms merelychange place with each other. The Kirkendall effectis readily explained in terms of vacancies since thelattice defect may interchange places more frequently
with one atom than the other. The effect is also of

diffusion.

some practical importance, especially in the ﬁelds of
metal-to-metal bonding, sintering and creep.
6.4.3 Factors affecting diffusion
The two most important factors affecting the diffu-
sion coefﬁcient Dare temperature and composition.
Because of the activation energy term the rate of diffu-
sion increases with temperature according to equation
(6.12), while each of the quantities D,D0andQ
varies with concentration; for a metal at high temper-
atures Q³20RTm,D0is 10/NUL5to 10/NUL3m2s/NUL1,a n d
D'10/NUL12m2s/NUL1. Because of this variation of diffu-
sion coefﬁcient with concentration, the most reliableinvestigations into the effect of other variables neces-sarily concern self-diffusion in pure metals.
Diffusion is a structure-sensitive property and,
therefore, Dis expected to increase with increasing
lattice irregularity. In general, this is found experi-mentally. In metals quenched from a high temper-
ature the excess vacancy concentration ³10
9leads
to enhanced diffusion at low temperatures since DD
D0cvexp⊿/NULEm/kT/triangleleft. Grain boundaries and disloca-
tions are particularly important in this respect and
produce enhanced diffusion. Diffusion is faster in the
cold-worked state than in the annealed state, althoughrecrystallization may take place and tend to mask theeffect. The enhanced transport of material along dislo-
cation channels has been demonstrated in aluminium
where voids connected to a free surface by dislo-cations anneal out at appreciably higher rates thanisolated voids. Measurements show that surface and
grain boundary forms of diffusion also obey Arrhe-
nius equations, with lower activation energies thanforvolumediffusion,i.e. Q
vol½2Qg.b½2Qsurface.This
behaviour is understandable in view of the progres-
sively more open atomic structure found at grain
boundaries and external surfaces. It will be remem-bered, however, that the relative importance of thevarious forms of diffusion does not entirely depend on
the relative activation energy or diffusion coefﬁcient
values. The amount of material transported by any dif-fusion process is given by Fick’s law and for a givencompositiongradientalsodependsontheeffectivearea
through which the atoms diffuse. Consequently, since
the surface area (or grain boundary area) to volume
176Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
ratio of any polycrystalline solid is usually very small,
it is only in particular phenomena (e.g. sintering, oxi-dation,etc.) that grainboundariesand surfaces becomeimportant.Itisalsoapparentthatgrainboundarydiffu-sion becomes more competitive, the ﬁner the grain andthe lower the temperature. The lattice feature followsfrom the lower activation energy which makes it lesssensitive to temperature change. As the temperature
is lowered, the diffusion rate along grain boundaries
(and also surfaces) decreases less rapidly than the dif-fusion rate through the lattice. The importance of grainboundary diffusion and dislocation pipe diffusion isdiscussedagainin Chapter 7 in relationto deformationat elevated temperatures, and is demonstrated con-vincingly on the deformation maps (see Figure 7.68),wherethecreepﬁeldisextendedtolowertemperatureswhen grain boundary (Coble creep) rather than latticediffusion (Herring–Nabarro creep) operates.
Because of the strong binding between atoms, pres-
sure has little or no effect but it is observed that withextremely high pressure on soft metals (e.g. sodium)an increase in Qmay result. The rate of diffusion
also increases with decreasing density of atomic pack-ing. For example, self-diffusion is slower in fcc ironor thallium than in bcc iron or thallium when theresults are compared by extrapolation to the transfor-mation temperature. This is further emphasized by theanisotropic nature of Din metals of open structure.

6.5 Anelasticity and internal friction
For an elastic solid it is generally assumed that stress
and strain are directly proportional to one another, butin practice the elastic strain is usually dependent ontime as well as stress so that the strain lags behind thestress;thisisananelasticeffect.Onapplyingastressatalevelbelowtheconventionalelasticlimit,aspecimenwill show an initial elastic strain ε
efollowed by a
gradual increase in strain until it reaches an essentiallyconstant value, ε

the stress is removed the strain will decrease, but asmall amount remains which decreases slowly withtime. At any time tthe decreasing anelastic strain is
given by the relation εDε
anexp⊿/NULt//FS/triangleleftwhere/FSis
known as the relaxation time, and is the time takenfor the anelastic strain to decrease to 1 /e'36.79% of
its initial value. Clearly, if /FSis large, the strain relaxes
very slowly, while if small the strain relaxes quickly.

if the damping is small it can be shown that

By analogy with damping in electrical systems tan ˛
is often written equal to Q/NUL1.
There are many causes of internal friction arising
from the fact that the migration of atoms, lattice
defects and thermal energy are all time-dependent
processes. The latter gives rise to thermoelasticity and
occurs when an elastic stress is applied to a specimen
too fast for the specimen to exchange heat with itssurroundings and so cools slightly. As the sample
warms back to the surrounding temperature it expands
thermally, and hence the dilatation strain continues toincrease after the stress has become constant.
The diffusion of atoms can also give rise to
anelastic effects in an analogous way to the diffusion
of thermal energy giving thermoelastic effects. A
particular example is the stress-induced diffusion ofcarbon or nitrogen in iron. A carbon atom occupies
the interstitial site along one of the cell edges slightly
distorting the lattice tetragonally. Thus when iron
is stretched by a mechanical stress, the crystal axis
orientedinthedirectionofthestressdevelopsfavouredsites for the occupation of the interstitial atoms
relative to the other two axes. Then if the stress is
oscillated, such that ﬁrst one axis and then another is
stretched, the carbon atoms will want to jump from
one favoured site to the other. Mechanical work istherefore done repeatedly, dissipating the vibrational
energy and damping out the mechanical oscillations.
The maximum energy is dissipated when the time per
cycle is of the same order as the time required for the
diffusional jump of the carbon atom.
The physical properties of materials 177

The simplest and most convenient way of studying
this form of internal friction is by means of a K Oe

this is interstitial diffusion. In practice, it is difﬁcult to
vary the angular frequency over a wide range and thusit is easier to keep ωconstant and vary the relaxation

discussed above, and hence occurring in different fre-
quency and temperature regions. One important sourceofinternalfrictionisthatduetostressrelaxationacrossgrain boundaries. The occurrence of a strong internalfriction peak due to grain boundaryrelaxation was ﬁrst
demonstrated on polycrystalline aluminium at 300
°C
by Kˆe and has since been found in numerous other
metals. It indicates that grain boundaries behave ina somewhat viscous manner at elevated temperaturesand grain boundary sliding can be detected at very lowstressesbyinternalfrictionstudies.Thegrainboundarysliding velocity produced by a shear stress /FSis given

tals, domain boundariesin ferromagnetic materials and

nal friction and damping.
6.6 Ordering in alloys
6.6.1 Long-range and short-range order
An ordered alloy may be regarded as being made upof two or more interpenetrating sub-lattices, each con-taining different arrangements of atoms. Moreover, theterm ‘superlattice’ would imply that such a coher-ent atomic scheme extends over large distances, i.e.the crystal possesses long-range order. Such a perfect
arrangement can exist only at low temperatures, since
the entropy of an ordered structure is much lower thanthat of a disordered one, and with increasing tempera-ture the degree of long-range order, S, decreases until
178Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
atacriticaltemperature Tcitbecomeszero;thegeneral
form of the curve is shown in Figure 6.12. Partially-ordered structures are achieved by the formation ofsmall regions (domains) of order, each of which are
separated from each other by domain or anti-phase
domain boundaries, across which the order changesphase (Figure 6.13). However, even when long-range
order is destroyed, the tendency for unlike atoms to be
neighbours still exists, and short-range order resultsaboveT
c. The transition from complete disorder to
complete order is a nucleation and growth process and
may be likened to the annealing of a cold-worked
structure. At high temperatures well above Tc,t h e r e
are more than the random number of AB atom pairs,
and with the lowering of temperature small nuclei
of order continually form and disperse in an other-wise disordered matrix. As the temperature, and hencethermal agitation, is lowered these regions of order
become more extensive, until at T
cthey begin to link
together and the alloy consists of an interlocking meshof small ordered regions. Below T
cthese domains
absorb each other (cf. grain growth) as a result of
antiphase domain boundary mobility until long-rangeorder is established.
Some order–disorder alloys can be retained in a
state of disorder by quenching to room temperature
while in others (e.g. ˇ-brass) the ordering process
occurs almost instantaneously. Clearly, changes in the
degree of order will depend on atomic migration, so
that the rate of approach to the equilibrium conﬁgu-ration will be governed by an exponential factor of
the usual form, i.e. Rate DAe
/NULQ/RT. However, Bragg

Figure 6.13 An antiphase domain boundary .
has pointed out that the ease with which interlocking
domains can absorb each other to develop a scheme
of long-range order will also depend on the number of
possible ordered schemes the alloy possesses. Thus, in
ˇ-brass only two different schemes of order are possi-
ble, while in fcc lattices such as Cu 3Au four different
schemes are possible and the approach to complete
order is less rapid.
6.6.2 Detection of ordering
The determination of an ordered superlattice is usu-
ally done by means of the X-ray powder technique. In
a disordered solution every plane of atoms is statisti-
cally identical and, as discussedin Chapter 5, there are
reﬂections missing in the powder pattern of the mate-
rial. In an ordered lattice, on the other hand, alternateplanes become A-rich and B-rich, respectively, so that
these ‘absent’ reﬂections are no longer missing but
appear as extra superlattice lines. This can be seen
from Figure 6.14: while the diffracted rays from the
Aplanes are completely out of phase with those from
theBplanes their intensities are not identical, so that
a weak reﬂection results.
Applicationofthestructurefactorequationindicates
that the intensity of the superlattice lines is
proportional to jF
2jDS2⊿fA/NULfB/triangleleft2, from which
it can be seen that in the fully-disordered alloy,
whereSD0, the superlattice lines must vanish. In
some alloys such as copper–gold, the scattering
factor difference ⊿fA/NULfB/triangleleftis appreciable and the
superlattice lines are, therefore, quite intense and
easily detectable. In other alloys, however, such
as iron–cobalt, nickel–manganese, copper–zinc, the
term⊿fA/NULfB/triangleleftis negligible for X-rays and the
super-lattice lines are very weak; in copper–zinc, for

example, the ratio of the intensity of the superlattice
lines to that of the main lines is only about 1:3500.In some cases special X-ray techniques can enhancethis intensity ratio; one method is to use an X-
ray wavelength near to the absorption edge when
an anomalous depression of the f-factor occurs
which is greater for one element than for the other.As a result, the difference between f
AandfBis
increased. A more general technique, however, is to
use neutron diffraction since the scattering factorsfor neighbouring elements in the Periodic Table canbe substantially different. Conversely, as Table 5.4
indicates, neutron diffraction is unable to show the
existence of superlattice lines in Cu
3Au, because the
scattering amplitudes of copper and gold for neutronsare approximately the same, although X-rays show
them up quite clearly.
Sharp superlattice lines are observed as long as
order persists over lattice regions of about 10
/NUL3mm,
large enough to give coherent X-ray reﬂections. When
long-range order is not complete the superlattice lines
become broadened, and an estimate of the domain

of Taylor and Francis) .size can be obtained from a measurement of the line
breadth, as discussed in Chapter 5. Figure 6.15 showsvariation of order Sand domain size as determined
from the intensity and breadth of powder diffractionlines. The domain sizes determined from the Scherrerline-broadening formula are in very good agreementwith those observed by TEM. Short-range order ismuch more difﬁcult to detect but nowadays directmeasuring devices allow weak X-ray intensities to bemeasured more accurately, and as a result considerableinformation on the nature of short-range order hasbeen obtained by studying the intensity of the diffusebackground between the main lattice lines.
High-resolution transmission microscopy of thin
metal foilsallowsthe structureof domainsto be exam-ined directly. The alloy CuAu is of particular interest,since it has a face-centred tetragonal structure, oftenreferredtoasCuAu1below380

CuAu 11 structures shown in Figure 6.16. The ⊿002/triangleleft
planes are again alternately gold and copper, but half-
way along the a-axis of the unit cell the copper atoms
switch to gold planes and vice versa. The spacingbetween such periodic anti-phase domain boundariesis 5 unit cells or about 2 nm, so that the domains areeasily resolvable in TEM, as seen in Figure 6.17a. Theisolated domain boundaries in the simpler superlat-tice structures such as CuAu 1, although not in thiscase periodic, can also be revealed by electron micro-scope,andanexampleisshowninFigure 6.17b.Apartfrom static observations of these superlattice struc-tures, annealing experiments inside the microscopealso allow the effect of temperature on the structure tobe examined directly. Such observations have shownthat the transition from CuAu 1 to CuAu 11 takesplace, as predicted, by the nucleation and growth ofanti-phase domains.
6.6.3 Inﬂuence of ordering on properties
Speciﬁc heat The order–disorder transformation has
a marked effect on the speciﬁc heat, since energy
is necessary to change atoms from one conﬁgurationto another. However, because the change in latticearrangement takes place over a range of temperature,thespeciﬁcheatversustemperaturecurvewillbeoftheform shown in Figure 6.4b. In practice the excess spe-ciﬁc heat, above that given by Dulong and Petit’s law,does not fall sharply to zero at T
cowing to the exis-
tence of short-range order, which also requires extraenergy to destroy it as the temperature is increasedaboveT

Electrical resistivity As discussed in Chapter 4, any
form of disorder in a metallic structure (e.g. impuri-
ties, dislocations or point defects) will make a largecontribution to the electrical resistance. Accordingly,
superlattices below Tchave a low electrical resistance,
but on raising the temperature the resistivity increases,
as shown in Figure 6.18a for ordered Cu 3Au. The
inﬂuenceoforderonresistivityisfurtherdemonstrated
bythemeasurement ofresistivityasafunctionofcom-
position in the copper –gold alloy system. As shown in
Figure 6.18b, at composition near Cu 3Au and CuAu,
where ordering is most complete, the resistivity is
extremely low, while away from these stoichiomet-ric compositionstheresistivityincreases;thequenched
(disordered) alloys given by the dotted curve also have
high resistivity values.
Mechanical properties The mechanical properties
are altered when ordering occurs. The change in yield

stress when well-ordered than when only partially-
ordered. Experiments show that such effects can be
accounted for if the maximum strength as a result of
ordering is associated with critical domain size. In thealloy Cu
3Au, the maximum yield strength is exhibited
by quenched samples after an annealing treatment of 5
min at 350 °C which gives a domain size of 6 nm (see
Figure 6.15). However, if the alloy is well-ordered and
thedomainsizelarger,thehardeningisinsigni ﬁcant.In
some alloys such as CuAu or CuPt, ordering produces
a change of crystal structure and the resultant lattice
strains can also lead to hardening. Thermal agitationis the most common means of destroying long-range
order, but other methods (e.g. deformation) are equally
effective. Figure 6.18c shows that cold work has a
negligible effect upon the resistivity of the quenched
(disordered) alloy but considerable in ﬂuence on the
well-annealed (ordered) alloy. Irradiation by neutrons
or electrons also markedly affects the ordering (see
Chapter 4).
Magnetic properties The order –disorder pheno-
menon is of considerable importance in the application
of magnetic materials. The kind and degree of order

6.7 Electrical properties
6.7.1 Electrical conductivity
Oneofthemostimportantelectronicpropertiesofmet-
als is the electrical conductivity, /DC4, and the reciprocal
of the conductivity (known as the resistivity, /SUB)i s
deﬁned by the relation RD/SUBl/A,w h e r e Ris the resis-
tance of the specimen, lis the length and Ais the
cross-sectional area.
A characteristic feature of a metal is its high electri-
cal conductivitywhich arises from the ease with which
the electrons can migrate through the lattice. The highthermal conduction of metals also has a similar expla-nation, and the Wiedmann–Franz law shows that theratio of the electrical and thermal conductivities isnearly the same for all metals at the same temperature.
Since conductivity arises from the motion of con-
ductionelectronsthroughthelattice,resistancemustbecaused by the scattering of electron waves by any kindof irregularity in the lattice arrangement. Irregularitiescan arise from any one of several sources,such as tem-perature, alloying, deformation or nuclear irradiation,
since all will disturb, to some extent, the periodicity
of the lattice. The effect of temperature is particularlyimportant and, as shown in Figure 6.19, the resistanceincreases linearly with temperature above about 100 Kup to the melting point. On melting, the resistance
increases markedly because of the exceptional disor-
der of the liquid state. However, for some metals suchas bismuth, the resistance actually decreases, owingto the fact that the special zone structure which makes
Figure 6.19 Variation of resistivity with temperature .bismuthapoorconductorinthesolidstateisdestroyed
on melting.
In most metals the resistance approaches zero at
absolute zero, but in some (e.g. lead, tin and mer-
cury) the resistance suddenly drops to zero at someﬁnite critical temperature above 0 K. Such metals are
called superconductors. The critical temperature is dif-
ferent for each metal but is always close to absolute
zero; the highestcritical temperature known for an ele-
ment is 8 K for niobium. Superconductivity is nowobserved at much higher temperatures in some inter-
metallic compounds and in some ceramic oxides (see
Section 6.7.4).
An explanation of electrical and magnetic properties
requires a more detailed consideration of electronicstructure than that brieﬂy outlined in Chapter 1. There
the concept of band structure was introduced and the
electron can be thought of as moving continuously
through the structure with an energy depending on the
energy level of the band it occupies. The wave-likeproperties of the electron were also mentioned. For the
electrons the regular array of atoms on the metallic
lattice can behave as a three-dimensional diffraction
grating since the atoms are positively-charged and
interactwithmovingelectrons.Atcertainwavelengths,governed by the spacing of the atoms on the metallic
lattice, the electrons will experience strong diffraction
effects, the results of which are that electrons havingenergies corresponding to such wavelengths will be
unable to move freely through the structure. As a
consequence, in the bands of electrons, certain energy
levels cannot be occupied and therefore there will be
energy gaps in the otherwise effectively continuousenergy spectrum within a band.
The interaction of moving electrons with the metal
ions distributedon a lattice depends on the wavelength
of the electrons and the spacing of the ions in the
direction of movement of the electrons. Since the ionicspacing will depend on the direction in the lattice, the
wavelengthofthe electronssufferingdiffraction bythe
ions will depend on their direction. The kinetic energy
of a moving electron is a function of the wavelength
according to the relationship
EDh
2/2m/NAK2(6.14)
Since we are concerned with electron energies, it is
more convenient to discuss interaction effects in terms
of the reciprocal of the wavelength. This quantity is
called the wave number and is denoted by k.
In describing electron–lattice interactions it is usual
to make use of a vector diagram in which the direction
of the vector is the direction of motion of the moving
electron and its magnitude is the wave number of
the electron. The vectors representing electrons havingenergies which, because of diffraction effects, cannot
penetrate the lattice, trace out a three-dimensional
surface knownas a Brillouinzone. Figure 6.20a shows
such a zone for a face-centred cubic lattice. It is made
upofplanefaceswhichare,infact,paralleltothemost

widely-spaced planes in the lattice, i.e. in this case the
f111gandf200gplanes. This is a general feature of
Brillouin zones in all lattices.
For a given direction in the lattice, it is possible to
consider the form of the electronenergies as a functionof wave number. The relationship between the twoquantities as given from equation (6.14) is
EDh
2k2/2m (6.15)
which leads to the parabolic relationship shown as a
broken line in Figure 6.20b. Because of the existenceof a Brillouin zone at a certain value of k, depending
on the lattice direction, there exists a range of energy
values which the electrons cannot assume. This pro-duces a distortion in the form of the E-kcurve in the
neighbourhood of the critical value of kand leads to
the existence of a series of energy gaps, which cannot
be occupied by electrons. The E-kcurve showing this
effect is given as a continuous line in Figure 6.20b.
The existence of this distortion in the E-kcurve,
due to a Brillouin zone, is reﬂected in the densityof states versus energy curve for the free electrons.
As previously stated, the density of states–energy
curve is parabolic in shape, but it departs from thisform at energies for which Brillouin zone interactionsoccur. The result of such interactions is shown inFigure 6.21a in which the broken line represents the
N(E)-Ecurve for free electrons in the absence of
zone effects and the full line is the curve where azone exists. The total number of electrons needed toﬁll the zone of electrons delineated by the full linein Figure 6.21a is 2 N,w h e r e Nis the total number
of atoms in the metal. Thus, a Brillouin zone would
be ﬁlled if the metal atoms each contributed twoelectrons to the band. If the metal atoms contributemore than two per atom, the excess electrons must beaccommodated in the second or higher zones.
Figure 6.21 Schematic representation of Brillouin zones .
In Figure 6.21a the two zones are separated by an
energy gap, but in real metals this is not necessarilythe case, and two zones can overlap in energy in theN(E)-Ecurves so that no such energy gaps appear.
This overlap arises from the fact that the energy ofthe forbidden region varies with direction in the latticeand often the energy level at the top of the ﬁrst zonehas a higher value in one direction than the lowest
energy level at the bottom of the next zone in some
other direction. The energy gap in the N(E)-Ecurves,
which represent the summation of electronic levels inall directions, is then closed (Figure 6.21b).
For electrical conduction to occur, it is necessary
that the electrons at the top of a band should beable to increase their energy when an electric ﬁeld isapplied to materials so that a net ﬂow of electrons inthe direction of the applied potential, which manifests
The physical properties of materials 183
itself as an electric current, can take place. If an
energy gap between two zones of the type shown
in Figure 6.21a occurs, and if the lower zone is just
ﬁlled with electrons, then it is impossible for any
electrons to increase their energy by jumping intovacant levels under the inﬂuence of an applied electric
ﬁeld, unless the ﬁeld strength is sufﬁciently great to
supply the electrons at the top of the ﬁlled band with
enough energy to jump the energy gap. Thus metallic
conduction is due to the fact that in metals the numberof electrons per atom is insufﬁcient to ﬁll the band up
to the point where an energy gap occurs. In copper, for
example, the 4 svalency electrons ﬁll only one half of
the outer s-band. In other metals (e.g. Mg) the valency
band overlaps a higher energy band and the electronsnear the Fermi level are thus free to move into the
empty states of a higher band. When the valency band
iscompletelyﬁlledandthenexthigherband,separated
by an energy gap, is completely empty, the material is
either an insulator or a semiconductor. If the gap isseveral electron volts wide, such as in diamond where
it is 7 eV, extremely high electric ﬁelds would be
necessary to raise electrons to the higher band and the
material is an insulator. If the gap is small enough,
such as 1–2 eV as in silicon, then thermal energymay be sufﬁcient to excite some electrons into the
higher band and also create vacancies in the valency
band, the material is a semiconductor. In general, the
lowest energy band which is not completely ﬁlled with
electrons is called a conduction band, and the bandcontaining the valency electrons the valency band. For
a conductor the valency band is also the conduction
band. The electronic state of a selection of materials
of different valencies is presented in Figure 6.21c.
Although all metals are relatively good conductors ofelectricity, they exhibit among themselves a range
of values for their resistivities. There are a number of
reasons for this variability. The resistivity of a metal
depends on the density of states of the most energetic
electrons at the top of the band, and the shape of theN(E)-Ecurve at this point.
Inthetransitionmetals,forexample,apartfrompro-
ducing the strong magnetic properties, great strength
and high melting point, the d-band is also responsi-
ble for the poor electrical conductivity and high elec-tronic speciﬁc heat. When an electron is scattered by
a lattice irregularity it jumps into a different quan-
tum state, and it will be evident that the more vacant
quantum states there are available in the same energy
range, the more likely will be the electron to deﬂectat the irregularity. The high resistivities of the transi-
tion metals may, therefore, be explained by the ease
with which electrons can be deﬂected into vacant d-
states. Phonon-assisted s-dscattering gives rise to the
non-linear variation of /SUBwith temperature observed at
high temperatures. The high electronic speciﬁc heat is
also due to the high density of states in the unﬁlled d-
band, since this gives rise to a considerable number of
electrons at the top of the Fermi distributionwhich can
be excited by thermal activation. In copper, of course,there are no unﬁlled levels at the top of the d-band
into which electrons can go, and consequently both
the electronic speciﬁc heat and electrical resistance is
low. The conductivity also depends on the degree to
which the electrons are scattered by the ions of the
metal which are thermally vibrating, and by impurity
atoms or other defects present in the metal.
Insulatorscanalsobemodiﬁedeitherbytheapplica-
tion of high temperatures or by the addition of impu-
rities. Clearly, insulators may become conductors at
elevated temperatures if the thermal agitation is sufﬁ-
cient to enable electrons to jump the energy gap into
the unﬁlled zone above.
6.7.2 Semiconductors
Some materials have an energy gap small enough
to be surmounted by thermal excitation. In such
intrinsicsemiconductors,as they are called, the current
carriers are electrons in the conduction band and
holes in the valency band in equal numbers. The
relative position of the two bands is as shown in
Figure 6.22. The motion of a hole in the valency
band is equivalent to the motion of an electron in
the opposite direction. Alternatively, conduction may
be produced by the presence of impurities which
either add a few electrons to an empty zone or
remove a few from a full one. Materials whichhave their conductivity developed in this way are
commonly known as semiconductors. Silicon and
germanium containingsmall amounts of impurityhave
semiconducting properties at ambient temperatures
and, as a consequence, they are frequently used in
electronic transistor devices. Silicon normally has
completely ﬁlled zones, but becomes conducting if
some of the silicon atoms, which have four valency
electrons, are replaced by phosphorus, arsenic or
antimony atoms which have ﬁve valency electrons.
The extra electrons go into empty zones, and as a
Figure 6.22 Schematic diagram of an intrinsic
semiconductor showing the relative positions of the
conduction and valency bands .
184Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
result silicon becomes an n-type semiconductor, since
conduction occurs by negative carriers. On the other
hand, the addition of elements of lower valency than
silicon, such as aluminium, removes electrons from
the ﬁlled zones leaving behind ‘holes’ in the valency
band structure. In this case silicon becomes a p-type
semiconductor,sincethemovement of electronsinone
direction of the zone is accompanied by a movement
of ‘holes’ in the other, and consequently they act
as if they were positive carriers. The conductivity
may be expressed as the product of (1) the number
of charge carriers, n, (2) the charge carried by each
(i.e.eD1.6ð10/NUL19C) and (3) the mobility of the
carrier, /SYN.
A pentavalent impurity which donates conduction
electrons without producing holes in the valency band
is called a donor. The spare electrons of the impurity
atoms are bound in the vicinity of the impurity atoms
in energy levels known as the donor levels, which
are near the conduction band. If the impurity exists
in an otherwise intrinsic semiconductor the number of
electrons in the conduction band become greater than
the number of holes in the valency band and, hence,
the electrons are the majority carriers and the holes the
minoritycarriers.Suchamaterialisan n-typeextrinsic
semiconductor (see Figure 6.23a).
Figure 6.23 Schematic energy band structure of (a) n-type
and (b) p-type semiconductor .Trivalent impurities in Si or Ge show the opposite
behaviour leaving an empty electron state, or hole,in the valency band. If the hole separates from theso-called acceptor atom an electron is excited from
the valency band to an acceptor level E³0.01 eV.
Thus, with impurity elements such as Al, Ga or Increating holes in the valency band in addition to thosecreated thermally, the majority carriers are holes and
the semiconductor is of the p-type extrinsic form
(see Figure 6.23b). For a semiconductor where bothelectrons and holes carry current the conductivity is

Semiconductor materials are extensively used in
electronic devices such as the p–nrectifying junction,
transistor (a double-junction device) and the tunneldiode. Semiconductor regions of either p-o rn-type
can be produced by carefully controlling the distribu-
tion and impurity content of Si or Ge single crystals,and the boundary between p-a n d n-type extrinsic
semiconductormaterialsiscalleda p–njunction.Such
a junction conducts a large current when the voltage is
applied in one direction, but only a very small cur-rent when the voltage is reversed. The action of ap–njunction as a rectiﬁer is shown schematically in
Figure 6.24. The junction presents no barrier to the
ﬂow of minority carriers from either side, but since theconcentration of minority carriers is low, it is the ﬂow
of majority carriers which must be considered. When
the junction is biased in the forward direction, i.e. n-
type made negative and the p-type positive, the energy
barrieropposingtheﬂowofmajoritycarriersfromboth
sides of the junction is reduced. Excess majority car-
riers enter the pandnregions, and these recombine
continuously at or near the junction to allow large cur-rents to ﬂow. When the junction is reverse-biased, the
energy barrier opposing the ﬂow of majority carriers
is raised, few carriers move and little current ﬂows.
A transistor is essentially a single crystal with two
p–njunctions arranged back to back to give either a
p–n–porn–p–ntwo-junction device. For a p–n–p
devicethemaincurrentﬂowisprovidedbythepositiveholes, while for a n–p–ndevice the electrons carry
the current. Connections are made to the individual
regions of the p–n–pdevice, designated emitter, base

andthebaseismadeslightlynegativeandthecollector
more negative relative to the emitter. The emitter-base junction is therefore forward-biased and a strongcurrent of holes passes through the junction into the
n-layer which, because it is thin (10
/NUL2mm), largely
reach the collector base junction without recombiningwith electrons. The collector-base junction is reverse-biased and the junction is no barrier to the passage of
holes; the current through the second junction is thus
controlled by the current through the ﬁrst junction.A small increase in voltage across the emitter-basejunction produces a large injection of holes into the
base and a large increase in current in the collector, to
give the amplifying action of the transistor.
Many varied semiconductor materials such as InSb
and GaAs have been developed apart from Si and Ge.However, in all cases very high purity and crystal
perfection is necessary for efﬁcient semiconducting
operations and to produce the material, zone-reﬁningtechniques are used. Semiconductor integrated circuitsare extensively used in micro-electronic equipment
and these are produced by vapour deposition through
masks on to a single Si-slice, followed by diffusion ofthe deposits into the base crystal.
Doped ceramic materials are used in the construc-
tion ofthermistors , which are semiconductor devices
withamarkeddependenceofelectricalresistivityupontemperature. The change in resistance can be quitesigniﬁcant at the critical temperature. Positive temper-
ature coefﬁcient (PTC) thermistors are used as switch-
ing devices, operating when a control temperature isreached during a heating process. PTC thermistors arecommonly based on barium titanate. Conversely, NTCthermistors are based on oxide ceramics and can be
used to signal a desired temperature change during
cooling;the change in resistance is much more gradualand does not have the step-characteristic of the PTCtypes.
Doped zinc oxide does not exhibit the linear volt-
age/current relation that one expects from Ohm’s Law.At low voltage, the resistivity is high and only a smallcurrent ﬂows. When the voltage increases there is a
sudden decrease in resistance, allowing a heavier cur-
rent to ﬂow. This principle is adopted in the varistor,
a voltage-sensitive on/off switch. It is wired in parallelwith high-voltage equipment and can protect it from
transient voltage ‘spikes’ or overload.
6.7.3 Superconductivity
At low temperatures ( <20 K) some metals have zero
electrical resistivityand become superconductors. This
superconductivity disappears if the temperature of
the metal is raised above a critical temperature Tc,
if a sufﬁciently strong magnetic ﬁeld is applied orwhen a high current density ﬂows. The critical ﬁeld

Hcon temperature for a number of metals; metals with
high TcandHcvalues, which include the transition
elements, are known as hard superconductors, those
with low values such as Al, Zn, Cd, Hg, white-Sn are
soft superconductors.The curves are roughlyparabolic
andapproximatetotherelation HcDH0[1/NUL⊿T/Tc/triangleleft2]
where H0is the critical ﬁeld at 0 K; H0is about
1.6ð105A/m for Nb.
Superconductivity arises from conduction elec-
tron–electron attraction resulting from a distortion ofthe lattice through which the electrons are travelling;
this is clearly a weak interaction since for most metals
it is destroyed by thermal activation at very low tem-
peratures. As the electron moves through the lattice
it attracts nearby positive ions thereby locally caus-ing a slightly higher positive charge density. A nearby
electron may in turn be attracted by the net positive
charge, the magnitude of the attraction depending on
theelectrondensity,ionicchargeandlatticevibrational
frequencies such that under favourable conditions theeffect is slightly stronger than the electrostatic repul-
sion between electrons. The importance of the lattice
ions in superconductivity is supported by the obser-
vation that different isotopes of the same metal (e.g.
Sn and Hg) have different T
cvalues proportional to
M/NUL1/2,w h e r e Mis the atomic mass of the isotope.
Since both the frequency of atomic vibrations and
the velocity of elastic waves also varies as M/NUL1/2,
the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations
Figure 6.26 Variation of critical ﬁeld Hcas a function of
temperature for several pure metal superconductors .
186Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
(i.e. electron–phonon interaction) must be at least one
cause of superconductivity.
The theory of superconductivity indicates that the
electron–electron attraction is strongest between elec-
trons in pairs, such that the resultant momentum ofeach pair is exactly the same and the individual elec-
trons of each pair have opposite spin. With this partic-
ular form of ordering the total electron energy (i.e.kinetic and interaction) is lowered and effectively
introduces a ﬁnite energy gap between this organized
state and the usual more excited state of motion. The
gap corresponds to a thin shell at the Fermi surface,
but does not produce an insulator or semiconductor,because the application of an electric ﬁeld causes the
whole Fermi distribution, together with gap, to drift
to an unsymmetrical position, so causing a current toﬂow. This current remains even when the electric ﬁeld
is removed, since the scattering which is necessary to
alter the displaced Fermi distribution is suppressed.
At 0 K all the electrons are in paired states but as
the temperature is raised, pairs are broken by thermal
activation giving rise to a number of normal electrons
in equilibrium with the superconducting pairs. With
increasing temperature the number of broken pairsincreasesuntilat T
ctheyareﬁnallyeliminatedtogether
with the energy gap; the superconducting state then
reverts to the normal conducting state. The supercon-ductivity transition is a second-order transformation
and a plot of C/Tas a function of T
2deviates from
the linear behaviour exhibited by normal conductingmetals, the electronic contribution being zero at 0 K.
The main theory of superconductivity, due to Bardeen,
Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) attempts to relate T
cto
the strength of the interaction potential, the density
of states at the Fermi surface and to the average fre-
quency of lattice vibration involved in the scattering,
and provides some explanation for the variation of Tc
with the e/aratio for a wide range of alloys, as shown
in Figure 6.27. The main effect is attributable to the
Figure 6.27 The variation of Tcwith position in the
periodic table (from Mathias, 1959, p. 138; courtesy of
North-Holland Publishing Co.) .change in density of states with e/aratio. Supercon-
ductivity is thus favoured in compounds of polyvalent
atoms with crystal structures having a high density of
states at the Fermi surface. Compounds with high Tc
values, such as Nb 3Sn (18.1 K), Nb 3Al (17.5 K), V 3Si
(17.0 K), V 3Ga (16.8 K), all crystallize with the ˇ-
tungsten structure and have an e/aratio close to 4.7;
Tcis very sensitive to the degree of order and to devi-
ation from the stoichiometric ratio, so values probablycorrespond to the non-stoichiometric condition.
The magnetic behaviour of superconductivity is as
remarkable as the corresponding electrical behaviour,
as shown in Figure 6.28 by the Meissner effect foran ideal (structurally perfect) superconductor. It isobserved for a specimen placed in a magnetic ﬁeld⊿H < H
c/triangleleft, which is then cooled down below Tc,t h a t
magnetic lines of force are pushed out. The specimen
is a perfect diamagnetic material with zero inductanceas well as zero resistance. Such a material is termedan ideal type I superconductor. An ideal type II super-
conductorbehavessimilarlyatlowﬁeldstrengths,with
H<H
cl<Hc, but then allows a gradual penetration
of the ﬁeld returning to the normal state when pen-etration is complete at H>H
c2>Hc. In detail, the
ﬁeld actually penetrates to a small extent in type I
superconductors when it is below Hcand in type II
superconductors when His below Hcl, and decays
away at a penetration depth ³100–10nm.
The observation of the Meissner effect in type I
superconductors implies that the surface between the
normal and superconducting phases has an effectivepositive energy. In the absence of this surface energy,the specimen wouldbreak up into separate ﬁne regions
of superconducting and normal material to reduce the
work done in the expulsion of the magnetic ﬂux. Anegative surface energy exists between the normaland superconducting phases in a type II superconduc-tor and hence the superconductor exists naturally in
a state of ﬁnely-separated superconducting and nor-
mal regions. By adopting a ‘mixed state’ of normaland superconducting regions the volume of interface ismaximized while at the same time keeping the volume

ture of the mixed state is believed to consist of linesof normal phases parallel to the applied ﬁeld throughwhich the ﬁeld lines run, embedded in a supercon-ducting matrix. The ﬁeld falls off with distances fromthe centre of each line over the characteristic distance/NAK, and vortices or whirlpools of supercurrents ﬂow
around each line; the ﬂux line, together with its cur-rent vortex, is called a ﬂuxoid. At H

the cross-section of the sample and type II supercon-ductivity disappears. Type II superconductors are ofparticular interest because of their high critical ﬁeldswhich makes them potentially useful for the construc-tion of high-ﬁeld electromagnetics and solenoids. To
produce a magnetic ﬁeld of ³10 T with a conven-
tional solenoid would cost more than ten times that ofa superconducting solenoid wound with Nb
3Sn wire.
By embedding Nb wire in a bronze matrix it is pos-sible to form channels of Nb
3Sn by interdiffusion.
The conventional installation would require consid-erable power, cooling water and space, whereas thesuperconducting solenoid occupies little space, has nosteady-state power consumption and uses relativelylittle liquid helium. It is necessary, however, for thematerial to carry useful currents without resistancein such high ﬁelds, which is not usually the case inannealed homogeneous type II superconductors. For-tunately, the critical current density is extremely sen-sitive to microstructure and is markedly increased byprecipitation-hardening, cold work, radiation damage,
etc., because the lattice defects introducedpin the ﬂux-
oids and tend to immobilize them. Figure 6.29 showsthe inﬂuence of metallurgical treatment on the criticalcurrent density.

In 1986 a new class of ‘warm’ superconductors, based
on mixed ceramic oxides, was discovered by J. G.Bednorz and K. A. M ¨uller. These lanthanum–copper
oxide superconductors had a T
caround 35 K, well
above liquid hydrogen temperature. Since then, threemixed oxide families have been developed with muchhigher T
cvalues, all around 100 K. Such materials
give rise to optimism for superconductor technology;ﬁrst, in the use of liquid nitrogen rather than liquidhydrogen and second, in the prospect of producing aroom temperature superconductor.
The ﬁrst oxide family was developed by mixing
and heating the three oxides Y
2O3, BaO and CuO.
This gives rise to the mixed oxide YBa 2Cu3O7/NULx,
sometimesreferredtoas1–2–3com pound or YBCO.
The structure is shown in Figure 6.30 and is basicallymade by stacking three perovskite-type unit cells oneabove the other; the top and bottom cells have bariumions at the centre and copper ions at the corners, themiddle cell has yttrium at the centre. Oxygen ions sit
half-way along the cell edges but planes, other than
those containing barium, have some missing oxygenions (i.e. vacancies denoted by xin the oxide formula).
This structure therefore has planes of copper andoxygen ions containingvacancies, and copper–oxygenion chains perpendicular to them. YBCO has a T
c
value of about 90 K which is virtually unchanged
when yttrium is replaced by other rare earth elements.The second family of oxides are Bi–Ca–Sr–Cu–O
x
materials with the metal ions in the ratio of 2111,2122 or 2223, respectively. The 2111 oxide has onlyonecopper–oxygenlayerbetweenthebismuth-oxygenlayers, the 2122 two and the 2223 three giving rise toan increasing T
cup to about 105 K. The third family
is based on Tl–Ca–Ba–Cu–O with a 2223 structurehaving three copper–oxygen layers and a T
cof about
125 K.
While these oxide superconductors have high Tc
values and high critical magnetic ﬁeld ( Hc)-values,
they unfortunately have very low values of Jc,t h e
critical current density. A high Jcis required if they
are to be used for powerful superconducting magnets.Electrical applications are therefore unlikely until theJ
cvalue can be raised by several orders of magni-
tude comparable to those of conventional supercon-
ductors, i.e. 106Ac m/NUL2. The reason for the low Jc
is thought to be largely due to the grain boundaries
in polycrystalline materials, together with dislocations,
voids and impurity particles. Single crystals show Jc
valuesaround105Ac m/NUL2andtexturedmaterials, pro-
duced by melt growth techniques, about 104Ac m/NUL2,
but both processes have limited commercial applica-tion.Electronicapplicationsappear tobe more promis-ing since it is in the area of thin (1
µm) ﬁlms that
highJcvalues have been obtained. By careful deposi-
tion control, epitaxial and single-crystal ﬁlms having
Jc×106Ac m/NUL2withlowmagneticﬁeld dependence
have been produced.

6.8 Magnetic properties
6.8.1 Magnetic susceptibility
When a metal is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld of strength
H, the ﬁeld induced in the metal is given by
BDHC4/EMI (6.17)
where Iis the intensity of magnetization. The quantity
Iisacharacteristicpropertyofthemetal,andisrelated
tothesusceptibilityperunitvolumeofthemetalwhichis deﬁned as
/DC4DI/H (6.18)
The susceptibility is usually measured by a method
which depends upon the fact that when a metalspecimen is suspended in a non-uniform transversemagnetic ﬁeld, a force proportional to /DC4V.H.dH/dx,
where Vis the volume of the specimen and d H/dx
is the ﬁeld gradient measured transversely to the lines
of force, is exerted upon it. This force is easily mea-
sured by attaching the specimen to a sensitive bal-ance, and one type commonly used is that designedby Sucksmith. In this balance the distortion of acopper–beryllium ring, caused by the force on thespecimen, is measured by means of an optical or
electro-mechanicalsystem.Thosemetalsforwhich /DC4is
negative, such as copper, silver, gold and bismuth, are
repelled by the ﬁeld and are termed diamagnetic mate-
rials. Most metals, however, have positive /DC4values
(i.e. they are attracted by the ﬁeld) and are either para-magnetic (when /DC4is small) or ferromagnetic (when /DC4
is very large). Only four pure metals–iron, cobalt andnickel from the transition series, and gadolinium from
the rare earth series–are ferromagnetic ⊿/DC4³1000/triangleleft
at room temperature, but there are several ferromag-netic alloys and some contain no metals which arethemselves ferromagnetic. The Heusler alloy, whichcontains manganese, copper and aluminium, is one
example; ferromagnetism is due to the presence of one
of the transition metals.
The ability of a ferromagnetic metal to concen-
trate the lines of force of the applied ﬁeld is of greatpractical importance, and while all such materials canbe both magnetized and demagnetized, the ease with
which this can be achieved usuallygoverns their appli-
cation in the various branches of engineering. Materi-als may be generally classiﬁed either as magneticallysoft (temporary magnets) or as magnetically hard (per-manent magnets), and the difference between the two

6.8.2 Diamagnetism and paramagnetism
Diagmagnetism is a universal property of the atomsince it arises from the motion of electrons in their
orbits around the nucleus. Electrons moving in thisway represent electrical circuits and it follows from
Lenz’s law that this motion is altered by an applied
ﬁeld in such a manner as to set up a repulsive force.
The diamagnetic contribution from the valency elec-
trons is small, but from a closed shell it is proportionalto the number of electrons in it and to the square of the
radius of the ‘orbit’. In many metals this diamagnetic
effect is outweighed by a paramagnetic contribution,the origin of which is to be found in the electron
spin. Each electron behaves like a small magnet and
in a magnetic ﬁeld can take up one of two orienta-
tions, either along the ﬁeld or in the other opposite
direction, depending on the direction of the electronspin. Accordingly, the energy of the electron is either
decreased or increased and may be represented conve-
nientlyby the band theory. Thus, if we regard the band
ofenergylevelsassplitintotwohalves(Figure 6.32a),
each half associated with electrons of opposite spin, itfollows that in the presence of the ﬁeld, some of the
electrons will transfer their allegiance from one band
to the other until the Fermi energy level is the same in
both.Itisclear,therefore,thatinthisstatetherewillbe
a larger number of electrons which have their energylowered bytheﬁeld than havetheir energyraised. This
conditiondeﬁnesparamagnetism,sincetherewillbean
excess of unpaired spins which give rise to a resultantmagnetic moment.
It is evident that an insulator will not be paramag-
neticsincethebandsarefullandtheloweredhalf-bandcannot accommodate those electrons which wish to‘spill over’ from the raised half-band. On the other
hand, it is not true, as one might expect, that conduc-
tors are always paramagnetic. This follows becausein some elements the natural diamagnetic contributionoutweighs the paramagnetic contribution; in copper,
for example, the newly ﬁlled d-shell gives rise to a
larger diamagnetic contribution.
6.8.3 Ferromagnetism
Thetheoryofferromagnetismisdifﬁcultandatpresentnot completely understood. Nevertheless, from theelectron theory of metals it is possible to build up
a band picture of ferromagnetic materials which goes
a long way to explain not only their ferromagneticproperties but also the associated high resistivity and
electronic speciﬁc heat of these metals compared to
copper.Inrecentyearsconsiderableexperimentalworkhas been done on the electronic behaviour of the tran-sition elements, and this suggests that the electronic
structure of iron is somewhat different to that of cobalt
and nickel.
Ferromagnetism, like paramagnetism, has its ori-
gin in the electron spin. In ferromagnetic materials,
however, permanent magnetism is obtained and this
indicates that there is a tendency for electron spins toremain aligned in one direction even when the ﬁeld
has been removed. In terms of the band structure this
means that the half-band associated with one spin isautomatically lowered when the vacant levels at itstop are ﬁlled by electrons from the top of the other

nickel and (b) ferromagnetic nickel (after Raynor, 1958; by

190Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
(Figure 6.32b); the change in potential energy asso-
ciated with this transfer is known as the exchangeenergy. Thus, while it is energetically favourable fora condition in which all the spins are in the samedirection, an opposing factor is the Pauli exclusionprinciple, because if the spins are aligned in a singledirection many of the electrons will have to go intohigher quantum states with a resultant increase inkinetic energy. In consequence, the conditions forferro-magnetism are stringent, and only electrons frompartially ﬁlled dorflevels can take part. This con-
dition arises because only these levels have (1) vacantlevels available for occupation, and (2) a high densityof states which is necessary if the increase in kineticenergy accompanying the alignment of spins is to besmaller than the decrease in exchange energy. Both ofthese conditions are fulﬁlled in the transition and rare-earth metals, but of all the metals in the long periodsonly the elements iron, cobalt and nickel are ferromag-netic at room temperature, gadolinium just above RT
⊿T
c³16°C/triangleleftand the majority are infact stronglypara-
magnetic. This observation has led to the conclusionthat the exchange interactions are most favourable, atleast for the iron group of metals, when the ratio ofthe atomic radius to the radius of the unﬁlled shell, i.e.thed-shell, is somewhat greater than 3 (see Table 6.1).
As a result of this condition it is hardly surprising thatthere are a relatively large number of ferromagneticalloys and compounds, even though the base elementsthemselves are not ferromagnetic.

Underthe application of a magnetic ﬁeld the favourably-
oriented domains grow at the expense of the others

ﬁeld strengths it is also possible for unfavourably-
oriented domains to ‘snap-over’ into more favourable
orientations quite suddenly, and this process, which
canoftenbeheardusingsensitiveequipment,isknown
as the Barkhausen effect.
The state in which all the electron spins are in com-
plete alignment is possible only at low temperatures.
As the temperature is raised the saturation magnetiza-
tion is reduced, falling slowly at ﬁrst and then increas-
ingly rapidly, until a critical temperature, known as
the Curie temperature, is reached. Above this temper-
ature, Tc, the specimen is no longer ferromagnetic, but
becomes paramagnetic, and for the metals iron, cobalt,
and nickel this transition occurs at 780 °C, 1075 °C
and 365 °C. respectively. Such a cooperative process
may be readily understood from thermodynamic rea-
soning, since the additional entropy associated with
the disorder of the electron spins makes the disordered
(paramagnetic) state thermodynamically more stable at
high temperatures. This behaviour is similar to that
shown by materials which undergo the order–disorder
transformation and, as a consequence, ferromagnetic
metals exhibit a speciﬁc heat peak of the form previ-
ously shown (see Figure 6.4b).
A ferromagnetic crystal in its natural state has a
domain structure. From Figure 6.33 it is clear that
by dividing itself into domains the crystal is able to
eliminate those magnetic poles which would otherwise
occuratthesurface.Thewidthofthedomainboundary
or Bloch wall is not necessarily small, however, and
in most materials is of the order of 100 atoms in
thickness. By having a wide boundary the electron
spins in neighbouring atoms are more nearly parallel,
whichisaconditionrequiredtominimizetheexchange
energy. On the other hand, within any one domain
the direction of magnetization is parallel to a direction
of easy magnetization (i.e. h100iin iron, h111iin
nickel and h001iin cobalt) and as one passes across a
boundary the direction of magnetization rotates away
from one direction of easy magnetization to another.
To minimize this magnetically-disturbed region the
crystal will try to adopt a boundary which is as thin as
possible. Consequently, the boundary width adopted is

one of compromise between the two opposing effects,
and the material may be considered to possess a
magnetic interfacial or surface energy.
6.8.4 Magnetic alloys
The work done in moving a domain boundary dependson the energy of the boundary, which in turn dependson the magnetic anisotropy. The ease of magnetiza-
tion also depends on the state of internal strain in the
material and the presence of impurities. Both theselatter factors affect the magnetic ‘hardness’ through
the phenomenon of magnetostriction, i.e. the lattice
constants are slightly altered by the magnetization sothat a directive inﬂuence is put upon the orientation ofmagnetization of the domains. Materials with inter-
nal stresses are hard to magnetize or demagnetize,
while materials free from stresses are magneticallysoft. Hence, since internal stresses are also responsiblefor mechanical hardness, the principle which governs
the design of magnetic alloys is to make permanent
magnetic materials as mechanically hard and soft mag-nets as mechanically soft as possible.
Magnetically soft materials are used for trans-
former laminations and armature stampings where ahigh permeability and a low hysteresis are desirable:iron–silicon or iron–nickel alloys are commonly used
for this purpose. In the development of magnetically
soft materials it is found that those elements whichform interstitial solid solutions with iron are thosewhich broaden the hysteresis loop most markedly. For
this reason, it is common to remove such impurities
from transformer iron by vacuum melting or hydrogenannealing.However,suchprocessesareexpensiveand,
consequently, alloys are frequently used as ‘soft’ mag-
nets, particularly iron–silicon and iron–nickel alloys(because silicon and nickel both reduce the amountof carbon in solution). The role of Si is to form a
/CR-loop and hence remove transformation strains and
also improve orientation control. In the production ofiron–silicon alloys the factors which are controlledinclude the grain size, the orientation difference from
onegraintothenext,andthepresenceofnon-magnetic
inclusions, since all are major sources of coerciveforce. The coercive force increases with decreasinggrain size because the domain pattern in the neigh-
bourhood of a grain boundary is complicated owing to
the orientation difference between two adjacent grains.Complex domain patterns can also arise at the free
surface of the metal unlessthese are parallel to a direc-
tion of easy magnetization. Accordingly, to minimizethe coercive force, rolling and annealing schedules areadopted to produce a preferred oriented material with
a strong ‘cube-texture’, i.e. one with two h100idirec-
tions in the plane of the sheet (see Chapter 7). Thisprocedure is extremely important, since transformermaterial is used in the form of thin sheets to mini-
mize eddy-current losses. Fe–Si–B in the amorphous
state is ﬁnding increasing application in transformers.The iron–nickel series, Permalloys , present many
interesting alloys and are used chieﬂy in communica-tion engineering where a high permeability is a neces-
sary condition. The alloys in the range 40–55% nickel
are characterized by a high permeability and at low
ﬁeld strengths this may be as high as 15000 compared
with 500 for annealed iron. The 50% alloy, Hyper-
nik, may have a permeability which reaches a value
of 70000, but the highest initial and maximum perme-
ability occurs in the composition range of the FeNi
3
superlattice,providedtheorderingphenomenonissup-
pressed. An interesting development in this ﬁeld is in
the heat treatment of the alloys while in a strong mag-netic ﬁeld. By such a treatment the permeability of
Permalloy 65 has been increased to about 260000.
This effect is thought to be due to the fact that dur-
ing alignment of the domains, plastic deformation is
possible and magnetostrictive strains may be relieved.
Magnetically hard materials are used for applica-
tions where a ‘permanent magnetic ﬁeld is required,
but where electromagnets cannot be used, such asin electric clocks, meters, etc. Materials commonly
used for this purpose include Alnico(Al–Ni–Co)
alloys,Cunico(Cu–Ni–Co) alloys, ferrites (barium
and strontium), samarium–cobalt alloys (SmCo

Sm2⊿Co, Fe, Cu, Zr /triangleleft17)a n dNeomax ⊿Nd2Fe14B/triangleleft.T h e
Alnicoalloys have high remanence but poor coerciv-
ities, the ferrites have rather low remanence but good
coercivities together with very cheap raw material
costs. The rare-earth magnets have a high performance
but are rather costly although the Nd-based alloys are
cheaper than the Sm-based ones.
In the development of magnetically hard materials,
the principle is to obtain, by alloying and heat treat-
ment, a matrix containing ﬁnely divided particles ofa second phase. These ﬁne precipitates, usually dif-
fering in lattice parameter from the matrix, set up
coherencystrainsinthelatticewhichaffectthedomainboundary movement. Alloys of copper–nickel–iron,
copper–nickel–cobalt and aluminium–nickel–cobalt
are of this type. An important advance in this ﬁeld
is to make the particle size of the alloy so small, i.e.
less than a hundred nanometres diameter, that eachgrain contains only a single domain. Then magneti-
zation can occur only by the rotation of the direc-
tion of magnetization en bloc. Alnico alloys con-
taining 6–12% Al, 14–25% Ni, 0–35% Co, 0–8%
Ti, 0–6% Cu in 40–70% Fe depend on this fea-
ture and are the most commercially important perma-nentmagnetmaterials.Theyareprecipitation-hardened
alloys and are heat-treated to produce rod-like pre-
cipitates (30 nm ð100 nm) lying along h100iin the
bcc matrix. During magnetic annealing the rods form
along the h100iaxis nearest to the direction of the
ﬁeld, when the remanence and coercivity are markedly
increased, Sm

and intrinsic coercivity. SmCo

compound and the individual grains are single-domain
particles. The big advantage of these magnets over theAlnicoalloys is their much higher coercivities.
TheHeusleralloys,copper–manganese–aluminium,
are of particular interest because they are made upfrom non-ferromagnetic metals and yet exhibit ferro-magnetic properties. The magnetism in this group of
alloys is associated with the compound Cu
2MnAl, evi-
dently because of the presence of manganese atoms.The compound has the Fe
3Al-type superlattice when
quenched from 800 °C, and in this state is ferromag-
netic, but when the alloy is slowly cooled it hasa/CR-brass structure and is non-magnetic, presumably
because the correct exchange forces arise from the lat-
tice rearrangement on ordering. A similar behaviour isfound in both the copper–manganese–gallium and thecopper–manganese–indium systems.
Theorder–disorderphenomenonisalsoofmagnetic
importance in many other systems. As discussed pre-viously, when ordering is accompanied by a structural
change, i.e. cubic to tetragonal, coherency strains are
set up which often lead to magnetic hardness. In FePt,for example, extremely high coercive forces are pro-duced by rapid cooling. However, because the changein mechanical properties accompanying the transfor-mation is found to be small, it has been suggested thatthehardmagnetic propertiesinthisalloyaredue tothe
small particle-size effect, which arises from the ﬁnely
laminated state of the structure.
6.8.5 Anti-ferromagnetism and
ferrimagnetism
Apart from the more usual dia-, para- and
ferromagnetic materials, there are certain substanceswhich are termed anti-ferromagnetic; in these, thenet moments of neighbouring atoms are aligned inopposite directions, i.e. anti-parallel. Many oxidesand chlorides of the transition metals are examplesincluding both chromium and ˛-manganese, and
also manganese–copper alloys. Some of the relevantfeatures of anti-ferromagnetism are similar in many
respects to ferromagnetism, and are summarized asfollows:
1. In general, the magnetization directions are aligned
paralleloranti-paralleltocrystallographicaxes,e.g.
in MnI and CoO the moment of the Mn
2Cand Co2C
ions are aligned along a cube edge of the unit cell.
The common directions are termed directions of
anti-ferromagnetism.
2. The degree of long-range anti-ferromagnetic order-
ing progressivelydecreases with increasing temper-
ature and becomes zero at a critical temperature,
Tn, known as the N ´eel temperature; this is the anti-
ferromagnetic equivalent of the Curie temperature.
3. An anti-ferromagnetic domain is a region in which
there is only one common direction of anti-
ferromagnetism; this is probably affected by lattice
defects and strain.
The most characteristic property of an anti-
ferromagneticmaterialisthatitssusceptibility /USshows
a maximum as a function of temperature, as shown in
Figure 6.34a.Asthetemperatureisraisedfrom0 Kthe
interaction which leads to anti-parallel spin alignment
becomes less effective until at Tnthe spins are free.
Similarcharacteristicfeaturesareshownintheresis-
tivity curves due to scattering as a result of spin dis-
order. However, the application of neutron diffraction
techniques provides a more direct method of study-
ing anti-ferromagnetic structures, as well as giving
the magnetic moments associated with the ions of the
metal. There is a magnetic scattering of neutrons inthe case of certain magnetic atoms, and owing to the
different scattering amplitude of the parallel and anti-
parallel atoms, the possibility arises of the existence
of superlattice lines in the anti-ferromagnetic state.
In manganese oxide MnO, for example, the param-
eter of the magnetic unit cell is 0.885 nm, whereas the
chemical unit cell (NaCl structure) is half this value,
0.443 nm.Thisatomicarrangement isanalogoustothe

The physical properties of materials 193
structure of an ordered alloy and the existence of mag-
netic superlattice lines below the N ´eel point (122 K)
has been observed, as shown in Figure 6.34b.
Some magnetic materials have properties which
are intermediate between those of anti-ferromagneticand ferromagnetic. This arises if the moments in onedirection are unequal in magnitude to those in theother, as, for example, in magnetite, Fe
3O4,w h e r et h e
ferrous and ferric ions of the FeO.Fe 2O3compound
occupy their own particular sites. N ´eel has called this
stateferrimagnetism and the corresponding materials
are termed ferrites. Such materials are of importance
in the ﬁeld of electrical engineering because they areferromagnetic without being appreciably conducting;eddy current troubles in transformers are, therefore,not so great. Strontium ferrite is extensively used inapplications such as electric motors, because of theseproperties and low material costs.
6.9 Dielectric materials
6.9.1 Polarization
Dielectric materials, usually those which are covalentor ionic, possess a large energy gap between thevalencebandandtheconductionband.Thesematerialsexhibit high electrical resistivity and have importantapplicationsasinsulators,whichpreventthetransferofelectrical charge, and capacitors which store electricalcharge. Dielectric materials also exhibit piezoelectricand ferroelectric properties.
Application of an electric ﬁeld to a material induces
the formation of dipoles (i.e. atoms or groups ofatoms with an unbalanced charge or moment) which
become aligned with the direction of the applied ﬁeld.
The material is then polarized. This state can arisefrom several possible mechanisms–electronic, ionicor molecular, as shown in Figure 6.35a-c. With elec-tronic polarization, the electron clouds of an atom aredisplaced with respect to the positively-charged ioncore setting up an electric dipole with moment /SYN
e.F o r
ionic solids in an electric ﬁeld, the bonds between theionsare elasticallydeformed and theanion–cationdis-tancesbecomecloserorfurtherapart,dependingonthedirection of the ﬁeld. These induced dipoles produce
polarization and may lead to dimensional changes.Molecular polarization occurs in molecular materials,
some of which contain natural dipoles. Such materialsare described as polar and for these the inﬂuence of an
applied ﬁeld will change the polarization by displacing
the atoms and thus changing the dipole moment (i.e.atomic polarizability) or by causing the molecule as a
whole to rotate to line up with the imposed ﬁeld (i.e.
orientation polarizability). When the ﬁeld is removedthese dipoles may remain aligned, leading to perma-
nent polarization.Permanent dipolesexistin asymmet-
rical molecules such as H
2O, organic polymers with
asymmetric structure and ceramic crystals without a
centre of symmetry.
6.9.2 Capacitors and insulators
In a capacitor the charge is stored in a dielectric mate-rial which is easily polarized and has a high electrical
resistivity ¾10
11VA/NUL1m to prevent the charge ﬂow-
ing between conductor plates. The ability of the mate-
rial to polarize is expressed by the permittivity εand
the relative permittivity or dielectric constant /DC4is the
ratio of the permittivity of the material and the permit-tivityof a vacuum ε
0. While a high /DC4isimportant for a
capacitor, a high dielectric strength or breakdown volt-
age is also essential. The dielectric constant /DC4values
for vacuum, water, polyethylene, Pyrexglass, alumina
and barium titanate are 1, 78.3, 2.3, 4, 6.5 and 3000,
respectively.
Structure is an important feature of dielectric
behaviour. Glassy polymers and crystalline materials
have a lower /DC4than their amorphous counterparts.
Polymers with asymmetric chains have a high /DC4
because of the strength of the associated molecular
dipole; thus polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene(PS) have larger /DC4’s than polyethylene (PE). BaTiO
3
has an extremely high /DC4value because of its
asymmetrical structure. Frequency response is alsoimportant in dielectric application, and depends on
the mechanism of polarization. Materials which rely
on electronic and ionic dipoles respond rapidly
to frequencies of 10
13–1016Hz but molecular
polarization solids, which require groups of atoms
to rearrange, respond less rapidly. Frequency is also
important in governing dielectric loss due to heat and

usually increases when one of the contributions to
polarizationisprevented.Thisbehaviouriscommonin
microwave heating of polymer adhesives; preferentialheating in the adhesive due to dielectric losses starts
the thermosetting reaction. For moderate increases,
raising the voltage and temperature increases thepolarizability and leads to a higher dielectric constant.
Nowadays, capacitor dielectrics combine materials
with different temperature dependence to yield a ﬁnalproduct with a small linear temperature variation.
These materials are usually titanates of Ba, Ca, Mg,
Sr and rare-earth metals.
For an insulator, the material must possess a high
electrical resistivity, a high dielectric strength to pre-
vent breakdown of the insulator at high voltages, alow dielectric loss to prevent heating and small dielec-
tric constant to hinder polarization and hence charge
storage. Materials increasingly used are alumina, alu-minium nitride, glass-ceramics, steatite porcelain and
glasses.
6.9.3 Piezoelectric materials
When stress is applied to certain materials an elec-tric polarization is produced proportional to the stress
applied. This is the well-known piezoelectric effect.Conversely, dilatation occurs on application of an
electric ﬁeld. Common materials displaying this prop-
erty are quartz, BaTiO
3, Pb(Ti, Zr)O3or PZT and
Na or LiNbO 3. For quartz, the piezoelectric con-
stant d relating strain εto ﬁeld strength F⊿εD
dðF/triangleleftis 2.3ð10/NUL12mV/NUL1, whereas for PZT it
is 250 ð10/NUL12mV/NUL1. The piezoelectric effect is
used in transducers which convert sound waves toelectric ﬁelds, or vice versa. Applications range
from microphones, where a few millivolts are gen-
erated, to military devices creating several kilo-volts and from small sub-nanometre displacements in
piezoelectrically-deformed mirrors to large deforma-
tions in power transducers.
6.9.4 Pyroelectric and ferroelectric materials
Some materials, associated with low crystal symmetry,are observed to acquire an electric charge whenheated; this is known as pyroelectricity. Because
of the low symmetry, the centre of gravity of the
positive and negative charges in the unit cell areseparated producing a permanent dipole moment.
Moreover, alignment of individual dipoles leads to
an overall dipole moment which is non-zero for thecrystal. Pyroelectric materials are used as detectors
of electromagnetic radiation in a wide band from
ultraviolet to microwave, in radiometers and inthermometers sensitive to changes of temperature as
small as 6 ð10
/NUL6°C. Pyroelectric TV camera tubes
have alsobeen developedforlong-wavelengthinfrared
imaging and are useful in providing visibility through
smoke. Typical materials are strontium barium niobateand PZT with Pb 2FeNbO 6additions to broaden the
temperature range of operation.
Ferroelectric materials are those which retain a
net polarization when the ﬁeld is removed and isexplained in terms of the residual alignment of per-manent dipoles. Not all materials that have perma-nent dipoles exhibit ferroelectric behaviour becausethese dipoles become randomly-arranged as the ﬁeld
is removed so that no net polarization remains. Ferro-
electrics are related to the pyroelectrics; for the formermaterials the direction of spontaneous polarization canbe reversed by an electric ﬁeld (Figure 6.36) whereasfor the latter this is not possible. This effect can bedemonstrated by a polarization versus ﬁeld hysteresisloop similar in form and explanation to the B–H mag-netichysteresisloop(seeFigure 6.31).Withincreasing
positive ﬁeld all the dipoles align to produce a satura-
tion polarization. As the ﬁeld is removed a remanentpolarization P
rremains due to a coupled interaction
betweendipoles.Thematerialispermanentlypolarizedand a coercive ﬁeld E
chas to be applied to randomize
the dipoles and remove the polarization.
Like ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity depends on
temperature and disappears above an equivalent Curie
temperature. For BaTiO 3, ferroelectricity is lost at
120°C when the material changes crystal structure. By
analogy with magnetism there is also a ferroelectricanalogue of anti-ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism.NaNbO
3, for example, has a Tc, of 640 °C and anti-
parallel electric dipoles of unequal moments charac-teristic of a ferrielectric material.

6.10 Optical properties
6.10.1 Reﬂection, absorption and
transmission effects
The optical properties of a material are related to the
interaction of the material with electromagnetic radi-ation, particularly visible light. The electromagnetic
spectrum is shown in Figure 5.1 from which it can be
seen that the wavelength /NAKvaries from 10
4m for radio
wavesdownto10/NUL14mf or /CR-rays andthecorrespond-
ing photon energies vary from 10/NUL10eV to 108eV.
Photons incident on a material may be reﬂected,
absorbed or transmitted. Whether a photon is absorbedor transmitted by a material depends on the energy gapbetween the valency and conduction bands and theenergy of the photon. The band structure for metals
has no gap and so photons of almost any energy are
absorbed by exciting electrons from the valency bandinto a higher energy level in the conduction band.Metals are thus opaque to all electromagnetic radiationfrom radio waves, through the infrared, the visible tothe ultraviolet, but are transparent to high-energy X-rays and /CR-rays. Much of the absorbed radiation is
reemitted as radiation of the same wavelength (i.e.
reﬂected). Metals are both opaque and reﬂective andit is the wavelength distribution of the reﬂected light,which we see, that determines the colour of the metal.Thus copper and gold reﬂect only a certain range ofwavelengths and absorb the remaining photons, i.e.
copper reﬂects the longer-wavelength red light and
absorbs the shorter-wavelength blue. Aluminium andsilver are highly reﬂective over the complete range ofthe visible spectrum and appear silvery.
Because of the gaps in their band structure non-
metals may be transparent. Thus if the photons haveinsufﬁcient energy to excite electrons in the mate-
rial to a higher energy level, they may be transmitted
rather than absorbed and the material is transparent.In high-purity ceramics and polymers, the energy gapis large and these materials are transparent to visiblelight. In semiconductors, electrons can be excited intoacceptorlevelsoroutofdonorlevelsandphononshav-ing sufﬁcient energy to produce these transitions will
be absorbed. Semiconductors are therefore opaque to
short wavelengths and transparent to long.
1The band
structure is inﬂuenced by crystallinity and hence mate-
rials such as glasses and polymers may be transparentin the amorphous state but opaque when crystalline.
High-purity non-metallics such as glasses, diamond

ics is produced by addition of transition metal impu-
rities which have unﬁlled d-shells. The photons easily

6.10.2 Optical ﬁbres
Modern communication systems make use of the abil-ity of optical ﬁbres to transmit light signals over largedistances. Optical guidance by a ﬁbre is produced (seeFigure 6.37) if a core ﬁbre of refractive index n
1is
surrounded by a cladding of slightly lower index n2
such that total internal reﬂection occurs conﬁning the
rays to the core; typically the core is about 100 µm
andn1/NULn2³10/NUL2. With such a simple optical ﬁbre,
interference occurs between different modes leadingto a smearing of the signals. Later designs use acore in which the refractive index is graded, parabol-ically, between the core axis and the interface withthe cladding. This design enables modulated signals tomaintain their coherency. In vitreous silica, the refrac-tiveindexcanbemodiﬁedbyadditionsofdopantssuchas P
2O5,G e O2which raise it and B 2O5and F which
lower it. Cables are sheathed to givestrength and envi-ronmental protection;PE and PVC are commonly usedfor limited ﬁre-hazard conditions.
6.10.3 Lasers
A laser (Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emissionof Radiation) is a powerful source of coherent light(i.e. monochromatic and all in phase). The originallaser material, still used, is a single crystal rod of
ruby, i.e. Al
2O3containing dopant Cr3Cions in solid
solution. Nowadays, lasers can be solid, liquid orgaseous materials and ceramics, glasses and semicon-ductors. In all cases, electrons of the laser materialare excited into a higher energy state by some suitablestimulus(see Figure 6.38). In a device thisis producedby the photons from a ﬂash tube, to give an intense

source of light surrounding the rod to concentrate the
energy into the laser rod. Alternatively an electricaldischarge in a gas is used. The ends of the laser rodare polished ﬂat and parallel and then silvered suchthatoneendistotally-reﬂectingandtheotherpartially-transmitting.
In the ruby laser, a xenon ﬂash lamp excites the
electrons of the Cr
3Cions into higher energy states.
Some of these excited electrons decay back to theirground state directly and are not involved in thelaser process. Other electrons decay into a metastableintermediate state before further emission returns themto the ground state. Some of the electrons in themetastable state will be spontaneously emitted after ashort ( ¾ms) rest period. Some of the resultant photons
are retained in the rod because of the reﬂectivity ofthe silvered ends and stimulate the release of otherelectrons from the metastable state. Thus one photonreleases another such that an avalanche of emissionsis triggered all in phase with the triggering photon.The intensity of the light increases as more emissionsare stimulated until a very high intense, coherent,collimated ‘burst’ of light is transmitted through thepartially-silvered end lasting a few nanoseconds andwith considerable intensity.
6.10.4 Ceramic ‘windows’
Many ceramics, usually oxides, have been prepared inoptically-transparent or translucent forms (translucentmeans that incident light is partly-reﬂected and partly-transmitted). Examples include aluminium oxide,magnesium oxide, their double oxide or spinel, andchalcogenides (zinc sulphide, zinc selenide). Verypure raw materials of ﬁne particle size are carefullyprocessed to eliminate voids and control grain sizes.Thus, translucent alumina is used for the arc tube of
high-pressure sodium lamps; a grain size of 25
µm
gives the best balance of translucency and mechanicalstrength.
Ceramics are also available to transmit electromag-
netic radiation with wavelengths which lie below orabove the visible range of 400–700 nm (e.g. infrared,microwave,radar,etc.).Typicalcandidatematerialsfordevelopment include vitreous silica, cordierite glass-ceramics and alumina.
6.10.5 Electro-optic ceramics
Certain specialceramics combine electricalandopticalproperties in a unique manner. Lead lanthanum zirco-nium titanate, known as PLZT, is a highly-transparentceramic which becomes optically birefringent whenelectrically charged. This phenomenon is utilized asa switching mechanism in arc welding goggles, giv-ing protection against ﬂash blindness. The PLZT plateis located between two ‘crossed’ sheets of polarizingmaterial. A small impressed d.c. voltage on the PLZTplate causes it to split the incident light into two raysvibrating in different planes. One of these rays canpass through the inner polar sheet and enter the eye. Asudden ﬂash of light will activate photodiodes in thegoggles, reduce the impressed voltage and cause rapiddarkening of the goggles.

Mechanical behaviour of materials
7.1 Mechanical testing procedures
7.1.1 Introduction
Real crystals, however carefully prepared, contain
lattice imperfections which profoundly affect those
properties sensitive to structure. Careful examinationof the mechanical behaviour of materials can giveinformation on the nature of these atomic defects.
In some branches of industry the common mechani-
cal tests, such as tensile, hardness, impact, creep andfatigue tests, may be used, not to study the ‘defectstate’ but to check the quality of the product pro-
duced against a standard speciﬁcation. Whatever its
purpose, the mechanical test is of importance in thedevelopment of both materials science and engineer-ing properties. It is inevitable that a large number of
different machines for performing the tests are in gen-
eral use. This is because it is often necessary to knowthe effect of temperature and strain rate at differentlevels of stress depending on the material being tested.Consequently, no attempt is made here to describe the
details of the various testing machines. The elements
of the various tests are outlined below.
7.1.2 The tensile test
In a tensile test the ends of a test piece are ﬁxed intogrips, one of which is attached to the load-measuringdevice on the tensile machine and the other to thestrainingdevice.Thestrainisusuallyappliedbymeans
of a motor-driven crosshead and the elongation of
the specimen is indicated by its relative movement.The load necessary to cause this elongation may beobtained from the elastic deﬂection of either a beamor proving ring, which may be measured by using
hydraulic, optical or electromechanical methods. The
last method (where there is a change in the resistanceof strain gauges attached to the beam) is, of course,easilyadaptedintoasystemforautographicallyrecord-
ing the load–elongation curve.The load–elongation curves for both polycrystalline
mild steel and copper are shown in Figures 7.1a and7.1b. The corresponding stress (load per unit area,
P/A) versus strain (change in length per unit length,
dl/l) curves may be obtained knowing the dimensions
of the test piece. At low stresses the deformation is
elastic, reversible and obeys Hooke’s law with stress
linearlyproportionaltostrain.Theproportionalitycon-stant connecting stress and strain is known as theelastic modulus and may be either (a) the elastic or
Young’s modulus, E, (b) the rigidity or shear modulus
/SYN, or (c) the bulk modulus K, depending on whether
the strain is tensile, shear or hydrostatic compressive,
respectively. Young’s modulus, bulk modulus, shear
modulus and Poisson’s ratio /ETB, the ratio of lateral con-
tractions to longitudinal extension in uniaxial tension,are related according to

In general, the elastic limit is an ill-deﬁned stress,
but for impure iron and low carbon steels the onset
of plastic deformation is denoted by a sudden drop in
load indicating both an upper and lower yield point.1
This yielding behaviour is characteristic of many met-
als, particularly those with bcc structure containing
small amounts of solute element (see Section 7.4.6).
For materials not showing a sharp yield point, a con-ventional deﬁnition of the beginning of plastic ﬂow is
the 0.1% proof stress, in which a line is drawn parallel
1Load relaxations are obtained only on ‘hard’ beam
Polanyi-type machines where the beam deﬂection is smallover the working load range. With ‘soft’ machines, those inwhich the load-measuring device is a soft spring, rapid loadvariations are not recorded because the extensions requiredare too large, while in dead-loading machines no loadrelaxations are possible. In these latter machines sudden
yielding will show as merely an extension under constant
load.

to the elastic portion of the stress–strain curve from
the point of 0.1% strain.
For control purposes the tensile test gives valuable
information on the tensile strength (TS Dmaximum
load/original area) and ductility (percentage reduction
inareaorpercentageelongation)ofthematerial.Whenit is used as a research technique, however, the exact
shape and ﬁne details of the curve, in addition to the
way in which the yield stress and fracture stress varywithtemperature, alloyingadditionsand grainsize, are
probably of greater signiﬁcance.
The increase in stress from the initial yield up to the
TS indicates that the specimen hardens during defor-
mation (i.e. work-hardens). On straining beyond theTS the metal still continues to work-harden, but at
a rate too small to compensate for the reduction in
cross-sectional area of the test piece. The deforma-tion then becomes unstable, such that as a localized
region of the gauge length strains more than the rest,
it cannot harden sufﬁciently to raise the stress for fur-ther deformation in this region above that to cause
further strain elsewhere. A neck then forms in the
gauge length, and further deformation is conﬁned tothis region until fracture. Under these conditions, the

the initial and ﬁnal areas of the neck gives a mea-sure of the localized strain, and is a better indicationthan the strain to fracture measured along the gauge
length.
True stress–true strain curves are often plotted to
show the work hardening and strain behaviour at large
strains. The true stress /ESCis the load Pdivided by the

Tensile specimens can also give information on the
type of fracture exhibited. Usually in polycrystallinemetals transgranular fractures occur (i.e. the fracturesurface cuts throughthe grains) and the ‘cup and cone’
type of fracture is extremely common in really duc-
tile metals such as copper. In this, the fracture startsat the centre of the necked portion of the test pieceand at ﬁrst grows roughly perpendicular to the tensile
axis, so forming the ‘cup’, but then, as it nears the
outer surface, it turns into a ‘cone’ by fracturing alonga surface at about 45
°to the tensile axis. In detail
the ‘cup’ itself consists of many irregular surfaces at
about 45 °to the tensile axis, which gives the fracture a
ﬁbrous appearance. Cleavage is also a fairly commontype of transgranular fracture, particularly in materi-als of bcc structure when tested at low temperatures.The fracture surface followscertain crystal planes(e.g.
f100gplanes), as is shown by the grains revealing
large bright facets, but the surface also appears gran-ular with ‘river lines’ running across the facets wherecleavage planes have been torn apart. Intercrystalline
fractures sometimes occur, often without appreciable
deformation. This type of fracture is usually causedby a brittle second phase precipitating out around thegrain boundaries, as shown by copper containing bis-
muth or antimony.
7.1.3 Indentation hardness testing
The hardness of a metal, deﬁned as the resistance to
penetration, gives a conveniently rapid indication ofits deformation behaviour. The hardness tester forces
a small sphere, pyramid or cone into the surface ofthe metals by means of a known applied load, and the
hardnessnumber(BrinellorVickersdiamondpyramid)
is then obtained from the diameter of the impression.The hardness may be related to the yield or tensilestrength of the metal, since during the indentation, thematerial around the impression is plastically deformedto a certain percentage strain. The Vickers hardnessnumber (VPN) is deﬁned as the load divided by the
pyramidal area of the indentation, in kgf/mm

should be maintained constant and small. Under theseconditions soft materials have similar values of BHNand VPN. Hardness testing is of importance in bothcontrol work and research, especially where informa-tion on brittle materials at elevated temperatures isrequired.
7.1.4 Impact testing
A material may have a high tensile strength and yetbe unsuitable for shock loading conditions. To deter-mine this the impact resistance is usually measured bymeans of the notched or un-notched Izod or Charpyimpact test. In this test a load swings from a givenheight to strike the specimen, and the energy dissi-pated in the fracture is measured. The test is partic-ularly useful in showing the decrease in ductility andimpact strength of materials of bcc structure at mod-erately low temperatures. For example, carbon steelshave a relatively high ductile–brittle transition tem-perature (Figure 7.1c) and, consequently, they may beused with safety at sub-zero temperatures only if thetransition temperature is lowered by suitable alloy-ing additions or by reﬁning the grain size. Nowadays,increasing importance is given to deﬁning a fracturetoughnessparameter K

contain small cracks which, when subjected to somecritical stress, propagate; K
cdeﬁnes the critical com-
bination of stress and crack length. Brittle fracture isdiscussed more fully in Chapter 8.
7.1.5 Creep testing
Creep is deﬁned as plastic ﬂow under constant stress,and althoughthe majority of tests are carried out underconstant load conditions, equipment is available forreducing the loading during the test to compensatefor the small reduction in cross-section of the spec-imen. At relatively high temperatures creep appears to

occur at all stress levels, but the creep rate increase
with increasing stress at a given temperature. For theaccurate assessment of creep properties, it is clear thatspecial attention must be given to the maintenance ofthespecimenataconstanttemperature,andtothemea-surement of the small dimensional changes involved.Thislatterprecautionisnecessary,sinceinmanymate-rials a rise in temperature by a few tens of degrees issufﬁcient to double the creep rate. Figure 7.3, curve a,
shows the characteristics of a typical creep curve andfollowing the instantaneous strain caused by the sud-den application of the load, the creep process may bedivided into three stages, usually termed primary ortransient creep, second or steady-state creep and ter-tiary or accelerating creep. The characteristics of thecreep curve often vary, however, and the tertiary stageof creep may be advanced or retarded if the tempera-ture and stress at which the test is carried out is highor low respectively (see Figure 7.3, curves bandc).
Creep is discussed more fully in Section 7.9.
7.1.6 Fatigue testing
The fatigue phenomenon is concerned with the prema-ture fracture of metals under repeatedly applied lowstresses, and is of importance in many branches ofengineering (e.g. aircraft structures). Several differ-ent types of testing machines have been constructedin which the stress is applied by bending, torsion,tension or compression, but all involve the same prin-
ciple of subjecting the material to constant cycles ofstress. To express the characteristics of the stress sys-tem, three properties are usually quoted: these include(1) the maximum range of stress, (2) the mean stress,and (3) the time period for the stress cycle. Four dif-
ferent arrangements of the stress cycle are shown in
Figure 7.4, but the reverse and the repeated cycle tests(e.g. ‘push–pull’)are themost common, since theyarethe easiest to achieve in the laboratory.
The standard method of studying fatigue is to pre-
pare a large number of specimens free from ﬂaws,
and to subject them to tests using a different range
of stress, S, on each group of specimens. The num-
ber of stress cycles, N, endured by each specimen at
a given stress level is recorded and plotted, as shownin Figure 7.5. This S–Ndiagram indicates that some
metals can withstand indeﬁnitely the application of a
large number of stress reversals, provided the applied
stressisbelowalimitingstressknownastheendurancelimit. For certain ferrous materials when they are usedin the absence of corrosive conditions the assumptionof a safe working range of stress seems justiﬁed, butfor non-ferrous materials and for steels when they are
used in corrosive conditions a deﬁnite endurance limit
cannot be deﬁned. Fatigue is discussed in more detailin Section 7.11.
7.1.7 Testing of ceramics
Direct tensile testing of ceramics is not generallyfavoured, mainly because of the extreme sensitivity ofceramics to surface ﬂaws. First, it is difﬁcult to apply
a truly uniaxial tensile stress: mounting the specimen
in the machine grips can seriously damage the surfaceand any bending of the specimen during the test willcauseprematurefailure.Second,suitablewaistedspec-imens with the necessary ﬁne and ﬂawless ﬁnish areexpensive to produce. It is therefore common practice
to use bend tests for engineering ceramics and glasses.
(They have long been used for other non-ductile mate-rials suchas concretes andgrey cast iron.) In thethree-andfour-pointbendmethodsportrayedinFigure 7.6,abeam specimen is placed between rollers and carefullyloaded at a constant strain rate. The ﬂexural strength
at failure, calculated from the standard formulae, is

known as the modulus of rupture (MoR) and expresses
themaximumtensilestresswhichdevelopsonthecon-vex face of the loaded beam. Strong ceramics, such as
silicon carbide and hot-pressed silicon nitride, have
very high MoR values. The four-point loading method
is often preferred because it subjects a greater volume
and area of the beam to stress and is therefore moresearching. MoR values from four-point tests are often
substantially lower than those from three-point tests
on the same material. Similarly, strength values tendto decrease as the specimen size is increased. To pro-
vide worthwhile data for quality control and design
activities, close attention must be paid to strain rate
and environment, and to the size, edge ﬁnish and sur-
face texture of the specimen. With oxide ceramics andsilica glasses, a high strain rate will give an appre-
ciably higher ﬂexural strength value than a low strain
rate, which leads to slow crack growth and delayedfracture (Section 10.7).
The bend test has also been adapted for use at high
temperatures. In one industrial procedure, specimens
of magnesia (basic) refractory are fed individually
from a magazine into a three-point loading zone at thecentre of an electric furnace heated by SiC elements.
A similar type of hot-bend test has been used for
the routine testing of graphite electrode samples and
gives a useful indication of their ability to withstand
accidentallateralimpactduringserviceinsteelmelting
furnaces.
Proof-testing is a long-established method of test-
ing certain engineering components and structures.
In a typical proof test, each component is held at a
certain proof stress for a ﬁxed period of time; load-
ing and unloading conditions are standardized. In the
case of ceramics, it may involve bend-testing, inter-
nal pressurization (for tubes) or rotation at high speed
(‘overspeeding’ of grinding wheels). Components that
withstand the proof test are, in the simplest analysis,
judged to be sound and suitable for long-term service
at the lower design stress. The underlying philosophy
has been often questioned, not least because there is a
risk that the proof test itself may cause incipient crack-
ing. Nevertheless, proof-testing now has an important
role in the statistical control of strength in ceramics.
7.2 Elastic deformation
7.2.1 Elastic deformation of metals
It is well known that metals deform both elastically
and plastically. Elastic deformation takes place at low
stresses and has three main characteristics, namely
(1) it is reversible, (2) stress and strain are linearly

and (3) it is usually small (i.e. <1% elastic strain).
The stress at a point in a body is usually deﬁned
by considering an inﬁnitesimal cube surrounding that
point and the forces applied to the faces of the cube by

Most commercial materials are polycrystalline, and
consequently they have approximately isotropic prop-erties. For such materials the modulus value is usuallyindependent of the direction of measurement because
the value observed is an average for all directions, in
the various crystals of the specimen. However, if dur-ing manufacture a preferred orientationof the grains in
the polycrystalline specimen occurs, the material will
behave, to some extent, like a single crystal and some‘directionality’ will take place.
7.2.2 Elastic deformation of ceramics
At ambient temperatures the proﬁle of the stress ver-sus strain curve for a conventional ceramic is similar
to that of a non-ductile metal and can be described
as linear-elastic, remaining straight until the point offracture isapproached. The stronginteratomic bondingof engineering ceramics confers mechanical stiffness.
Moduliofelasticity(elastic,shear)canbemuchhigher
than those of metallic materials. In the case of sin-gle ceramic crystals, these moduli are often highlyanisotropic (e.g. alumina). However, in their polycrys-
talline forms, ceramics are often isotropic as a result
of the randomizing effect of processing (e.g. isostaticpressing); nevertheless, some processing routes pre-serve anisotropic tendencies (e.g. extrusion). (Glasses
are isotropic, of course.) Moduli are greatly inﬂu-
enced by the presence of impurities, second phasesand porosity; for instance, the elastic modulus of aceramic is lowered as porosity is increased. As the
temperature of testing is raised, elastic moduli usually
show a decrease, but there are exceptions.7.3 Plastic deformation
7.3.1 Slip and twinning
The limit of the elastic range cannot be deﬁned
exactly but may be considered to be that value ofthe stress below which the amount of plasticity (irre-versible deformation) is negligible, and above whichthe amount of plastic deformation is far greater thanthe elastic deformation. If we consider the deforma-tion of a metal in a tensile test, one or other of twotypes of curve may be obtained. Figure 7.1a shows thestress–strain curve characteristic of iron, from which
it can be seen that plastic deformation begins abruptly
at A and continues initially with no increase in stress.The point A is known as the yield point and the stressatwhichitoccursistheyieldstress.Figure 7.1bshowsa stress–strain curve characteristic of copper, fromwhich it will be noted that the transition to the plasticrange is gradual. No abrupt yielding takes place and inthiscasethestressrequiredtostartmacroscopicplasticﬂow is known as the ﬂow stress.
Once the yield or ﬂow stress has been exceeded
plastic or permanent deformation occurs, and this isfound to take place by one of two simple processes,slip (or glide) and twinning. During slip, shown in
Figure 7.9a, the top half of the crystal moves over
the bottom half along certain crystallographic planes,known as slip planes, in such a way that the atomsmove forward by a whole number of lattice vectors;as a result the continuity of the lattice is maintained.During twinning (Figure 7.9b) the atomic movementsare not whole lattice vectors, and the lattice generatedinthedeformedregion,althoughthesameastheparentlattice, is oriented in a twin relationship to it. It willalso be observed that in contrast to slip, the shearedregion in twinning occurs over many atom planes, theatoms in each plane being moved forward by the sameamount relative to those of the plane below them.
7.3.2 Resolved shear stress
All working processes such as rolling, extrusion, forg-ing etc. cause plastic deformation and, consequently,these operations will involve the processes of slip ortwinning outlined above. The stress system appliedduring these working operations is often quite com-plex, but for plastic deformation to occur the presenceof a shear stress is essential. The importance of shear
Figure 7.9 Slip and twinning in a crystal .
204Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
stresses becomes clear when it is realized that these
stresses arise in most processes and tests even when
the applied stress itself is not a pure shear stress. This
may be illustrated by examining a cylindrical crys-
tal of areaAin a conventional tensile test under a
uniaxial loadP. In such a test, slip occurs on the
slip plane, shown shaded in Figure 7.10, the area of
which isA/cos/RS,w h e r e/RSis the angle between the
normal to the plane OH and the axis of tension. Theapplied forcePis spread over this plane and may be
resolved into a force normal to the plane along OH,
Pcos/RS, and a force along OS, Psin/RS. Here, OS is the
line of greatest slope in the slip plane and the force
Psin/RSisashearforce.Itfollowsthattheappliedstress
(force/area) is made up of two stresses, a normal stress
⊿P/A/triangleleftcos
2/RStending to pull the atoms apart, and a
shear stress⊿P/A/triangleleftcos/RSsin/RStrying to slide the atoms
over each other.
In general, slip does not take place down the line
of greatest slope unless this happens to coincide with
the crystallographic slip of direction. It is necessary,
therefore, to know the resolved shear stress on the slip
plane and in the slip direction. Now, if OT is taken
to represent the slip direction the resolved shear stresswill be given by
/ESCDPcos/RSsin/RScos/US/A
where/USis the angle between OS and OT. Usually this
formula is written more simply as
/ESCDPcos/RScos/NAK/A (7.4)
where/NAKis the angle between the slip direction OT and
the axis of tension. It can be seen that the resolved
shear stress has a maximum value when the slip plane
is inclined at 45
°to the tensile axis, and becomes
smaller for angles either greater than or less than 45 °.
When the slip plane becomes more nearly perpendic-
ular to the tensile axis ⊿/RS>45°/triangleleftit is easy to imagine
that the applied stress has a greater tendency to pull
the atoms apart than to slide them. When the slip
plane becomes more nearly parallel to the tensile axis
⊿/RS<45°/triangleleftthe shear stress is again small but in this
case it is because the area of the slip plane, A/cos/RS,
is correspondingly large.
Figure 7.10 Relation between the slip plane, slip direction
and the axis of tension for a cylindrical crystal .A consideration of the tensile test in this way shows
that it is shear stresses which lead to plastic defor-
mation, and for this reason the mechanical behaviour
exhibited by a material will depend, to some extent,
on the type of test applied. For example, a ductile
material can be fractured without displaying its plastic
properties if tested in a state of hydrostatic or triax-
ial tension, since under these conditions the resolved
shear stressonany planeiszero. Conversely,materialswhich normally exhibit a tendency to brittle behaviour
in a tensile test will show ductility if tested under con-
ditions of high shear stresses and low tension stresses.
Incommercialpractice,extrusionapproximatesclosely
to a system of hydrostatic pressure, and it is common
for normally brittle materials to exhibit some ductility
when deformed in this way (e.g. when extruded).
7.3.3 Relation of slip to crystal structure
An understanding of the fundamental nature of plastic
deformation processes is provided by experiments on
singlecrystalsonly,becauseifapolycrystallinesample
is used the result obtained is the average behaviour of
all the differently oriented grains in the material. Such
experiments with single crystals show that, although
the resolved shear stress is a maximum along lines of
greatest slope in planes at 45 °to the tensile axis, slip
occurs preferentially along certain crystal planes anddirections. Three well-established laws governing the
slip behaviour exist, namely: (1) the direction of slip
is almost always that along which the atoms are most
closely packed, (2) slip usually occurs on the most
closely packed plane, and (3) from a given set of slip
planes and directions, the crystal operates on that sys-
tem (plane and direction) for which the resolved shear
stress is largest. The slip behaviour observed in fcc
metals shows the general applicability of these laws,
since slip occurs along h110idirections in f111g
planes. In cph metals slip occurs along h11
20idirec-
tions, since these are invariably the closest packed,
but the active slip plane depends on the value of the
axial ratio. Thus, for the metals cadmium and zinc,
c/ais 1.886 and 1.856, respectively, the planes of
greatest atomic density are the f0001 gbasal planes
and slip takes place on these planes. When the axial
ratio is appreciably smaller than the ideal value of
c/aD1.633 the basal plane is not so closely packed,
nor so widely spaced, as in cadmium and zinc, and
other slip planes operate. In zirconium ⊿c/a D1.589/triangleleft
and titanium⊿c/a D1.587/triangleleft, for example, slip takes
place on the f1010gprism planesat room temperature
and on the f1011gpyramidal planes at higher tem-
peratures. In magnesium the axial ratio ⊿c/a D1.624/triangleleft
approximates to the ideal value, and although only
basal slip occurs at room temperature, at temperatures
above 225 °C slip on the f1011gplanes has also been
observed. Bcc metals have a single well-deﬁned close-
packed h111idirection, but several planes of equally
high density of packing, i.e. f112g,f110gandf123g.
Mechanical behaviour of materials 205
The choice of slip plane in these metals is often inﬂu-
enced by temperature and a preference is shown forf112gbelowT

f123gat high temperatures, where Tmis the melt-
ing point. Iron often slips on all the slip planes atonce in a common h111islip direction, so that a
slip line (i.e. the line of intersection of a slip plane
with the outer surface of a crystal) takes on a wavy
appearance.
7.3.4 Law of critical resolved shear stress
This law states that slip takes place along a given slipplane and direction when the shear stress reaches acritical value. In most crystals the high symmetry ofatomic arrangement provides several crystallographicequivalent planes and directions for slip (i.e. cph crys-
tals have three systems made up of one plane contain-
ing three directions, fcc crystals have twelve systemsmade up of four planes each with three directions,while bcc crystals have many systems) and in suchcases slip occurs ﬁrst on that plane and along thatdirection for which the maximum stress acts (law 3above). This is most easily demonstrated by testing intension a series of zinc single crystals. Then, because
zinc is cph in structure only one plane is available for
the slip process and the resultant stress–strain curvewill depend on the inclination of this plane to thetensile axis. The value of the angle /RSis determined
by chance during the process of single-crystal growth,and consequently all crystals will have different valuesof/RS, and the corresponding stress–strain curves will
have different values of the ﬂow stress as shown in
Figure 7.11a. However, because of the criterion of acritical resolved shear stress, a plot of resolved shearstress (i.e. the stress on the glide plane in the glidedirection) versus strain should be a common curve,within experimental error, for all the specimens. Thisplot is shown in Figure 7.11b.
The importance of a critical shear stress may be
demonstrated further by taking the crystal which hasits basal plane oriented perpendicular to the tensile
axis, i.e./RSD0
°, and subjecting it to a bend test. In
contrast to its tensile behaviour, where it is brittle itwill now appear ductile, since the shear stress on theslip plane is only zero for a tensile test and not for abendtest.Ontheotherhand,ifwetakethecrystalwithits basal plane oriented parallel to the tensile axis (i.e./RSD90
°) this specimen will appear brittle whatever
stress system is applied to it. For this crystal, althoughthe shear force is large, owing to the large area of theslip plane,A/cos/RS, the resolved shear stress is always
very small and insufﬁcient to cause deformation byslipping.
7.3.5 Multiple slip
The fact that slip bands, each consisting of many sliplines, are observed on the surface of deformed crystalsshows that deformation is inhomogeneous, with exten-sive slip occurring on certain planes, while the crystalplanes lying between them remain practically unde-formed. Figures 7.12a and 7.12b show such a crystalin which the set of planes shear over each other in theslip direction. In a tensile test, however, the ends ofa crystal are not free to move ‘sideways’ relative toeach other, since they are constrained by the grips ofthe tensile machine. In this case, the central portion of
thecrystalisalteredinorientation,androtationofboth
the slip plane and slip direction into the axis of ten-sion occurs, as shown in Figure 7.12c. This behaviouris more conveniently demonstrated on a stereographicprojection of the crystal by considering the rotation ofthe tensile axis relative to the crystal rather than viceversa. This is illustrated in Figure 7.13a for the defor-mation of a crystal with fcc structure. The tensile axis,P, is shown in the unit triangle and the angles between
Pand [

respectively. The active slip system is the ⊿111/triangleleftplane
and the [ 101] direction, and as deformation proceeds

moving along the zone, shown broken in Figure 7.13a,
towards [ 101],i.e. /NAKdecreasing and /RSincreasing.
As slip occurs on the one system, the primary sys-
tem, the slip plane rotates away from its position of
maximum resolved shear stress until the orientation ofthe crystal reaches the [001] /NUL[
111] symmetry line.
Beyond this point, slip should occur equally on both
theprimary systemanda secondsystem(theconjugate
system) ⊿111/triangleleft[011], since these two systems receive
equalcomponentsofshearstress.Subsequently,during
the process of multiple or duplex slip the lattice willrotatesoastokeepequalstressesonthetwoactivesys-
tems, and the tensile axis moves along the symmetry
line towards [
112]. This behaviour agrees with earlyobservations on virgin crystals of aluminium and cop-
per, but not with those made on certain alloys, or pure
metal crystals given special treatments (e.g. quenched
from a high temperature or irradiated with neutrons).
Results from the latter show that the crystal continues
to slip on the primary system after the orientation has
reached the symmetry line, causing the orientation to
overshoot this line, i.e. to continue moving towards
[101], in the direction of primary slip. After a certain
amount of this additional primary slip the conjugate
system suddenly operates, and further slip concen-
trates itself on this system, followed by overshooting
in the opposite direction. This behaviour, shown in
Figure 7.13b, isunderstandablewhenitisremembered
that slip on the conjugate system must intersect that on
the primary system, and to do this is presumably more
difﬁcult than to ‘ﬁt’ a new slip plane in the relatively
undeformed region between thoseplaneson which slip
has already taken place. This intersection process is
more difﬁcult in materials which have a low stacking
fault energy (e.g. ˛-brass).
7.3.6 Relation between work-hardening and
slip
The curves of Figure 7.1 show that following the yield
phenomenon a continual rise in stress is required to
continuedeformation,i.e.theﬂowstressofadeformed
metal increases with the amount of strain. This resis-
tance of the metal to further plastic ﬂow as the defor-
mation proceeds is known as work-hardening. The
degree ofwork-hardeningvariesfor metalsofdifferent
crystal structure, and is low in hexagonal metal crys-
tals such as zinc or cadmium, which usually slip on
one family of planes only. The cubic crystals harden
rapidly on working but even in this case when slip
is restricted to one slip system (see the curve for
specimen A, Figure 7.14) the coefﬁcient of harden-
ing, deﬁned as the slope of the plastic portion of the
stress–strain curve, is small. Thus this type of harden-
ing, like overshoot, must be associated with the inter-action which results from slip on intersecting families
ofplanes.Thisinteractionwillbedealtwithmorefully
in Section 7.6.2.

7.4 Dislocation behaviour during
plastic deformation
7.4.1 Dislocation mobility
The ease with which crystals can be plastically
deformed at stresses many orders of magnitude lessthan the theoretical strength ⊿/FS
tD/SYNb/2/EMa/triangleleftis quite
remarkable, and due to the mobility of dislocations.Figure 7.15a showsthatasa dislocationglidesthroughthe lattice it moves from one symmetrical latticeposition to another and at each position the dislocationis in neutral equilibrium, because the atomic forcesacting on it from each side are balanced. As thedislocation moves from these symmetrical latticepositions some imbalance of atomic forces doesexist, and an applied stress is required to overcomethis lattice friction. As shown in Figure 7.15b, anintermediate displacement of the dislocation also leadsto an approximately balanced force system.
The lattice friction depends rather sensitively on the
dislocationwidth wand hasbeen shownby Peierls and
Nabarro to be given by

for the shear of a rectangular lattice of interpla-
nar spacing awith wD/SYNb/2/EM⊿1/NUL/ETB/triangleleft/FS
tDa⊿1/NUL/ETB/triangleleft.
The friction stress is therefore often referred to asthe Peierls–Nabarro stress. The two opposing factorsaffecting ware (1) the elastic energy of the crystal,
which is reduced by spreading out the elastic strains,and (2) the misﬁt energy, which depends on the num-ber of misaligned atoms across the slip plane. Metalswith close-packed structures have extended disloca-
tions and hence wis large. Moreover, the close-packed
planes are widely spaced with weak alignment forcesbetween them (i.e. have a small b/afactor). These
metals have highly mobile dislocations and are intrin-sically soft. In contrast, directional bonding in crystalstends to produce narrow dislocations, which leads tointrinsic hardness and brittleness. Extreme examplesare ionic and ceramic crystals and the covalent mate-rials such as diamond and silicon. The bcc transitionmetalsdisplayintermediatebehaviour(i.e.intrinsicallyductile above room temperatures but brittle below).Direct measurements of dislocation velocity /ETBhave
now been made in some crystals by means of the etchpitting technique; the results of such an experiment areshown in Figure 7.16. Edge dislocations move fasterthan screws, because of the frictional drag of jogs onscrews, and the velocity of both varies rapidly with

tions moving and denotes the onset of microplasticity.
A macroscopic tensile test is a relatively insensitivemeasure of the onset of plastic deformation and the

Decreasingthetemperatureofthetestorincreasingthe
strain-rateincreasesthestresslevelrequiredtoproducethe same ﬁnite velocity (see Figure 7.17b), i.e. dis-
placing the velocity–stress curve to the right. Indeed,
hardening the material by any mechanism has thesame effect on the dislocation dynamics. This obser-vation is consistent with the increase in yield stress
with decreasing temperature or increasing strain-rate.
Most metals and alloys are hardened by cold workingor by placing obstacles (e.g. precipitates) in the pathof moving dislocations to hinder their motion. Such
strengthening mechanisms increase the stress neces-
sary to produce a given ﬁnite dislocation velocity in a
similar way to that found by lowering the temperature.
7.4.2 Variation of yield stress with
temperature and strain rate
The high Peierls–Nabarro stress, which is associated
with materials with narrow dislocations, gives rise to a
short-range barrier to dislocationmotion. Such barriers
are effective only over an atomic spacing or so, hencethermal activation is able to aid the applied stress in
overcoming them. Thermal activation helps a portion
of the dislocation to cross the barrier after which glidethen proceeds by the sideways movement of kinks.
(This process is shown in Figure 7.29, Section 7.4.8.)
Materials with narrow dislocations therefore exhibit
a signiﬁcant temperature-sensitivity; intrinsically hard
materials rapidly lose their strength with increasingtemperature, as shown schematically in Figure 7.18a.
In this diagram the (yield stress/modulus) ratio is plot-
ted against T/T
mto remove the effect of modulus
which decreases withtemperature. Figure 7.18bshows
that materials which exhibit a strong temperature-dependent yield stress also exhibit a high strain-rate

sensitivity, i.e. the higher the imposed strain rate, the
higher the yield stress. This arises because thermalactivation is less effective at the faster rate of defor-
mation.
In bcc metals a high lattice friction to the move-
ment of a dislocation may arise from the dissocia-
tion of a dislocation on several planes. As discussedin Chapter 4, when a screw dislocation with Burgers
vector a/2[111] lies along a symmetry direction it
can dissociate on three crystallographically equivalent
planes. If such a dissociation occurs, it will be nec-
essary to constrict the dislocation before it can glidein any one of the slip planes. This constriction will
be more difﬁcult to make as the temperature is low-
ered so that the large temperature dependence of the
yield stress in bcc metals, shown in Figure 7.18a and
also Figure 7.30, may be due partly to this effect. Infcc metals the dislocations lie on f111gplanes, and
although a dislocation will dissociate in any given
⊿111/triangleleftplane, there is no direction in the slip plane
along which the dislocation could also dissociate on
other planes; the temperature-dependence of the yieldstress is small as shown in Figure 7.18a. In cph metals
the dissociated dislocations moving in the basal plane
will also have a small Peierls force and be glissilewith
low temperature-dependence. However, screw dislo-
cations moving on non-basal planes (i.e. prismaticand pyramidal planes) may have a high Peierls force
because they are able to extend in the basal plane as
shown in Figure 7.19. Hence, constrictions will once
again have to be made before the screw dislocations
can advance on non-basal planes. This effect con-tributes to the high critical shear stress and strong
temperature-dependence of non-basal glide observed
in this crystal system, as mentioned in Chapter 4.
7.4.3 Dislocation source operation
When a stress is applied to a material the specimenplasticallydeforms at a rate governed by the strain rate
of the deformation process (e.g. tensile testing, rolling,
etc.) and the strain rate imposes a particular velocity
on the mobile dislocation population. In a crystal of

where xis the average distance a dislocation moves.
If the distance x'10/NUL4cm (the size of an average
sub-grain) the maximum strain produced by /SUB³107
is about ⊿107ð3ð10/NUL8ð10/NUL4/triangleleftwhich is only a
fraction of 1%. In practice, shear strains >100% can
be achieved, and hence to produce these large strains
many more dislocations than the original ingrown
dislocations are required. To account for the increasein number of mobile dislocations during straining the
concept of a dislocation source has been introduced.
The simplest type of source is that due to Frank and
Read and accounts for the regenerative multiplication
of dislocations. A modiﬁed form of the Frank–Readsourceisthemultiplecross-glidesource, ﬁrstproposed
by Koehler, which, as the name implies, depends on
the cross-slip of screw dislocations and is therefore
more common in metals of intermediate and high
stacking fault energy.
Figure 7.21 shows a Frank–Read source consisting
of a dislocation line ﬁxed at the nodes A and B
(ﬁxed, for example, because the other dislocations that
join the nodes do not lie in slip planes). Because
of its high elastic energy ( ³4 eV per atom plane
threaded by a dislocation) the dislocation possesses a
line tension tending to make it shorten its length as
much as possible (position 1, Figure 7.21). This line
tension Tis roughly equal to ˛/SYNb
2,w h e r e /SYNis the
shear modulus, bthe Burgers vector and ˛a constant
usually taken to be about1
2. Under an applied stress
the dislocation line will bow out, decreasing its radius
of curvature until it reaches an equilibrium position in
which the line tension balances the force due to theapplied stress. Increasing the applied stress causes theline to decrease its radius of curvature further until it
becomes semi-circular (position 2). Beyond this point
it has no equilibriumpositionso it willexpand rapidly,
rotating about the nodes and taking up the successionof forms indicated by 3, 4 and 5. Between stages 4
and 5 the two parts of the loop below AB meet and
annihilate each other to form a complete dislocationloop, which expands into the slip plane and a new
line source between A and B. The sequence is then
repeated and one unit of slip is produced by each loopthat is generated.
To operate the Frank–Read source the force applied
must be sufﬁcient to overcome the restoring force onthe dislocation line due to its line tension. Referring to
Figure 7.22 this would be 2 Td/DC2/2>/FS b ld/DC2/2, and if

of the Frank–Read source; the substitution of typical
values ( /SYND4ð1010Nm/NUL2,bD2.5ð10/NUL10m, and
lD10/NUL6m) into this estimate shows that a critical
shear stress of about 100 gf mm/NUL2is required. This
value is somewhat less than but of the same order as
that observed for the yield stress of virgin pure metal
single crystals. Another source mechanism involvesmultiple cross-slip as shown in Figure 7.23. It depends

on the Frank–Read principle but does not require a
dislocation segment to be anchored by nodes. Thus, ifpart of a moving screw dislocation undergoes doublecross-slip the two pieces of edge dislocation on the
cross-slip plane effectively act as anchoring points
for a new source. The loop expanding on the slipplane parallel to the original plane may operate as
a Frank–Read source and any loops produced may
in turn cross slip and become a source. This processtherefore not only increases the number of dislocations
on the original slip plane but also causes the slip band
to widen.
The concept of the dislocation source accounts
for the observation of slip bands on the surface of
deformed metals. The amount of slip produced by
the passage of a single dislocation is too small to beobservable as a slip line or band under the light micro-
scope. To be resolved it must be at least 300 nm in
height and hence ³1000 dislocations must have oper-
atedina givenslipband.Moreover,ingeneral, theslip
band has considerable width, which tends to support
the operation of the cross-glide source as the predom-inant mechanism of dislocation multiplication duringstraining.
7.4.4 Discontinuous yielding
In some materials the onset of macroscopic plastic
ﬂow begins in an abrupt manner with a yield drop
in which the applied stress falls, during yielding, froman upper to a lower yield point. Such yield behaviour
is commonly found in iron containing small amounts
of carbon or nitrogen as impurity. The main char-acteristics of the yield phenomenon in iron may besummarized as follows.
Yield point A specimen of iron during tensile defor-
mation (Figure 7.24a, curve 1) behaves elastically upto a certain high load A, known as the upper yield
point, and then it suddenly yields plastically. The
important feature to note from this curve is that the
stress required to maintain plastic ﬂow immediately
after yielding has started is lower than that required tostart it, as shown by the fall in load from A to B (the
lower yield point). A yield point elongation to C then
occurs after which the specimen work hardens and the
curve rises steadily and smoothly.
Overstraining The yield point can be removed tem-
porarily by applying a small preliminary plastic strain
tothespecimen. Thus,ifafter reachingthepointD,forexample, the specimen is unloaded and a second test is
made fairly soon afterwards, a stress–strain curve of
type 2 will be obtained. The specimen deforms elasti-
cally up to the unloading point, D, and the absence of
a yield point at the beginning of plastic ﬂow is char-acteristic of a specimen in an overstrained condition.
Strain-age hardening If a specimen which has been
overstrained to remove the yield point is allowed to
rest, or age, before retesting, the yield point returns asshown in Figure 7.24a, curve 3. This process, which is
accompanied by hardening (as shown by the increased
stress, EF, to initiate yielding) is known as strain-
ageing or, more speciﬁcally, strain-age hardening. In
iron, strain-ageing is slow at room temperature but isgreatly speeded up by annealing at a higher tempera-
ture. Thus, a strong yield point returns after an ageing
treatment ofonlyafew secondsat200
°C, butthesame
yield point will take many hours to develop if ageing
is carried out at room temperature.
L¨uders band formation Closely related to the yield
point is the formation of L ¨uders bands. These bands
are markings on the surface of the specimen which
Figure 7.24 Schematic representation of (a) strain ageing and (b) L¨ uders band formation .
212Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
distinguish those parts of the specimen that have
yielded, A, from those which have not, B. Arrival at
the upper yield point is indicated by the formation
of one or more of these bands and as the specimen
passes through the stage of the yield point elongationthese bands spread along the specimen and coalesce
until the entire gauge length has been covered. At this
stage the whole of the material withinthe gauge length
has been overstrained, and the yield point elongation
is complete. The growth of a L ¨uders band is shown
diagrammatically in Figure 7.24b. It should be noted
that the band is a macroscopic band crossing all
the grains in the cross-section of a polycrystalline
specimen, and thus the edges of the band are not
necessarily the traces of individual slip planes. Asecond point to observe is that the rate of plastic ﬂow
in the edges of a band can be very high even in an
apparently slow test; this is because the zones, marked
C in Figure 7.24b, are very narrow compared with the
gauge length.
These L¨uders bands frequently occur in drawing
and stamping operations when the surface markings
in relief are called stretcher strains. These markings
are unsightly in appearance and have to be avoided
on many ﬁnished products. The remedy consists inoverstraining the sheet prior to pressing operations, by
means of a temper roll, or roller levelling, pass so
that the yield phenomenon iseliminated. It is essential,
once this operation has been performed, to carry out
pressing before the sheet has time to strain-age; theuse of a ‘non-ageing’ steel is an alternative remedy.
These yielding effects are inﬂuenced by the pres-
ence of small amounts of carbon or nitrogen atoms
interacting with dislocations. The yield point can
be removed by annealing at 700
°C in wet-hydrogen
atmosphere, and cannot subsequently be restored by
any strain-ageing treatment. Conversely, exposing the
decarburized specimen to an atmosphere of dry hydro-
gen containing a trace of hydrocarbon at 700 °Cf o ra s
littleasone minuterestorestheyieldpoint.Thecarbonand nitrogen atoms can also be removed from solu-
tion in other ways: for example, by adding to the iron
suchelementsas molybdenum,manganese, chromium,
vanadium, niobium or titanium which have a strong
afﬁnity for forming carbides or nitrides in steels. Forthis reason, these elements are particularly effective in
removing the yield point and producing a non-strain
ageing steel.
The carbon/nitrogen atoms are important in yielding
process because they interact with the dislocations andimmobilize them. This locking of the dislocations is
brought about because the strain energy due to the
distortion of a solute atom can be relieved if it ﬁts into
a structural region where the local lattice parameter
approximates to that of the natural lattice parameter ofthe solute. Such a condition will be brought about by
thesegregationofsoluteatomstothedislocations,with
large substitutional atoms taking up lattice positions in
the expandedregion, and small onesin thecompressed
region;smallinterstitialatomswilltendtosegregate tointerstitialsitesbelow thehalf-plane. Thus,where both
dislocations and solute atoms are present in the lattice,
interactions of the stress ﬁeld can occur, resulting ina lowering of the strain energy of the system. Thisprovides a driving force tending to attract solute atoms
todislocationsandifthenecessarytimefordiffusionis
allowed, a solute atom ‘atmosphere’ will form aroundeach dislocation.
When a stress is applied to a specimen in which the
dislocations are locked by carbon atoms the disloca-
tions are not able to move at the stress level at which
free dislocations are normally mobile. With increas-ing stress yielding occurs when dislocations suddenlybecome mobile either by breaking away from the car-
bon atmosphere or by nucleating fresh dislocations
at stress concentrations. At this high stress level themobiledislocationdensityincreasesrapidly.Theloweryield stress is then the stress at which free dislocations
continue to move and produce plastic ﬂow. The over-
strained condition corresponds to the situation wherethe mobile dislocations, brought to rest by unloadingthe specimen, are set in motion again by reloadingbefore the carbon atmospheres have time to develop
by diffusion. If, however, time is allowed for diffu-
sion to take place, new atmospheres can re-form andimmobilize the dislocations again. This is the strain-aged condition when the original yield characteristics
reappear.
The upper yield point in conventional experiments
on polycrystalline materials is the stress at whichinitially yielded zones trigger yield in adjacent grains.As more and more grains are triggered the yield zones
spread across the specimen and form a L ¨uders band.
The propagation of yield is thought to occur when a
dislocation source operates and releases an avalancheof dislocations into its slip plane which eventually pile
up at a grain boundary or other obstacle. The stress
concentration at the head of the pile-up acts with theapplied stress on the dislocations of the next grainand operates the nearest source, so that the processis repeated in the next grain. The applied shear stress

Section 7.4.11.
7.4.5 Yield points and crystal structure
The characteristic feature of discontinuous yieldingis that at the yield point the specimen goes from
Mechanical behaviour of materials 213
a condition where the availability of mobile dislo-
cations is limited to one where they are in abun-dance, the increase in mobile density largely aris-
ing from dislocation multiplication at the high stress
level. A further feature is that not all the dislo-cations have to be immobilized to observe a yield
drop. Indeed, this is not usually possible because
specimen handling, non-axial loading, scratches, etc.give rise to stress concentrations that provide a small
local density of mobile dislocations (i.e. pre-yield
microtrain).
For materials with a high Peierls–Nabarro (P–N)
stress, yield drops may be observed even when theypossess a signiﬁcant mobile dislocation density. A
common example is that observed in silicon; this is
an extremely pure material with no impurities to lockdislocations,butusuallythedislocationdensityisquite
modest⊿10
7m/m3/triangleleftand possesses a high P–N stress.
When these materials are pulled in a tensile test
the overall strain rate P/CRimposed on the specimen
by the machine has to be matched by the motion ofdislocations according to the relation P/CRD/SUBb/ETB.H o w -
ever, because /SUBis small the individual dislocations
are forced to move at a high speed /ETB, which is only
attained at a high stress level (the upper yield stress)
because of the large P–N stress. As the dislocations
glide at these high speeds, rapid multiplication occurs
and the mobile dislocation density increases rapidly.
Because of the increased value of the term /SUB/ETB,al o w e r
average velocity of dislocations is then required to
maintain a constant strain rate, which means a lower
glide stress. The stress that can be supported by thespecimenthusdropsduringinitialyieldingtothelower
yield point, and does not rise again until the disloca-
tion–dislocation interactions caused by the increased/SUBproduce a signiﬁcant work-hardening.
In the fcc metals, the P–N stress is quite small and
the stress to move a dislocation is almost indepen-
dent of velocity up to high speeds. If such metals are
to show a yield point, the density of mobile disloca-tions must be reduced virtually to zero. This can be
achieved as shown in Figure 7.25 by the tensile test-
ingofwhiskercrystalswhichareveryperfect.Yieldingbeginsatthestressrequiredtocreatedislocationsinthe
perfect lattice, and the upper yield stress approaches
the theoretical yield strength. Following multiplica-tion, the stress for glide of these dislocations is several
orders of magnitude lower.
Bcc transition metals such as iron are intermediate
in their plastic behaviour between the fcc metals and
diamond cubic Si and Ge. Because of the signiﬁcant
P–N stress these bcc metals are capable of exhibit-
ing a sharp yield point even when the initial mobile
dislocation density is not zero, as shown by the cal-culated curves of Figure 7.26. However, in practice,
the dislocation density of well-annealed pure metals
is about 10
10m/m3and too high for any signiﬁcant
yield drop without an element of dislocation locking
by carbon atoms.

It is evident that discontinuous yielding can be
produced in all the common metal structures provided
the appropriate solute elements are present, and cor-
rect testing procedure adopted. The effect is particu-
larly strong in the bcc metals and has been observed
in˛-iron, molybdenum, niobium, vanadium and ˇ-
brass each containing a strongly interacting interstitial
solute element. The hexagonal metals (e.g. cadmium
and zinc) can also show the phenomenon provided
interstitial nitrogen atoms are added. The copper-
and aluminium-based fcc alloys also exhibit yielding
behaviour but often to a lesser degree. In this case it is
substitutionalatoms (e.g. zinc in ˛-brass and copper in
214Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
aluminium alloys) which are responsible for the phe-
nomenon (see Section 7.4.7).
7.4.6 Discontinuous yielding in ordered alloys
Discontinuous yield points have been observed in a
wide variety of A 3B-type alloys. Figure 7.27 shows
the development of the yield point in Ni 3Fe on ageing.
The addition of Al speeds up the kinetics of orderingand therefore the onset of the yield point. Orderedmaterials deform by superdislocation motion and the
link between yield points and superdislocations is con-
ﬁrmed by the observation that in Cu
3Au, for example,
a transition from groups of single dislocations to morerandomly arranged superdislocation pairs takes placeat¾SD0.7 (see Chapter 4) and this coincides with
the onset of a large yield drop and rapid rise in work
hardening.
Sharp yielding may be explained by at least two
mechanisms, namely (1) cross-slip of the superdislo-
cation onto the cube plane to lower the APB energy
effectively pinning it and (2) dislocation locking byrearrangement of the APB on ageing. The shear APBbetween a pair of superdislocations is likely to be
energetically unstable since there are many like bonds
across the interface and thermal activation will mod-ify this sharp interface by atomic rearrangement. ThisAPB-locking model will give rise to sharp yield-
ing because the energy required by the lead dislo-
cation in creating sharp APB is greater than that
released by the trailing dislocation initially moving
across diffuse APB. Experimental evidence favoursthe APB-model and weak-beam electron microscopy
(see Figure 7.28) shows that the superdislocation sep-
aration for a shear APB corresponds to an energy of
48š5m J / m
2, whereas a larger dislocation separation
corresponding to an APB energy of 25 š3m J / m2was
observed for a strained and aged Cu 3Au.
7.4.7 Solute–dislocation interaction
Iron containing carbon or nitrogen shows very markedyield point effects and there is a strong elastic interac-
tion between these solute atoms and the dislocations.
The solute atoms occupy interstitial sites in the lat-tice and produce large tetragonal distortions as well
as large-volume expansions. Consequently, they can
interact with both shear and hydrostatic stresses and
can lock screw as well as edge dislocations. Strong
yielding behaviour is also expected in other bcc met-als, provided they contain interstitial solute elements.
On the other hand, in the case of fcc metals the
arrangement of lattice positions around either intersti-
tial or substitutionalsites is too symmetrical to allow a
solute atom to produce an asymmetrical distortion,and

the atmosphere locking of screw dislocations, which
requires a shear stress interaction, would appear to beimpossible. Then by this argument, since the screwdislocations are not locked, a drop in stress at theyield point should not be observed. Nevertheless, yieldpoints are observed in fcc materials and one reasonfor this is that unit dislocations in fcc metals dissoci-ate into pairs of partial dislocations which are elasti-callycoupledbyastackingfault.Moreover, sincetheirBurgers vectors intersect at 120
°there is no orienta-
tion of the line of the pair for which both can be pure
screws. At least one of them must have a substantialedgecomponent,anda lockingofthisedgecomponentby hydrostatic interactions should cause a locking ofthe pair although it will undoubtedly be weaker.
In its quantitative form the theory of solute atom
locking has been applied to the formation of anatmosphere around an edge dislocation due to hydro-static interaction. Since hydrostatic stresses are scalarquantities, no knowledge is required in this case ofthe orientation of the dislocation with respect to the
interacting solute atom, but it is necessary in calcu-
lating shear stresses interactions.

The yield phenomenon is particularly strong in iron
because an additional effect is important; this concerns
216Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
the type of atmosphere a dislocation gathers round
itself which can be either condensed or dilute. Dur-
ing the strain-ageing process migration of the soluteatoms to the dislocation occurs and two important
cases arise. First, if all the sites at the centre of the
dislocation become occupied the atmosphere is thensaid to be condensed; each atom plane threaded by the
dislocation contains one solute atom at the position
of maximum binding together with a diffuse cloud of
other solute atoms further out. If, on the other hand,
equilibrium is established before all the sites at thecentre are saturated, a steady state must be reached
in which the probability of solute atoms leaving the
centre can equal the probability of their entering it.The steady-state distribution of solute atoms around
the dislocations is then given by the relation
C
⊿R,/DC2/triangleleftDc0exp[V⊿R,/DC2/triangleleft/kT]
wherec0is the concentration far from a dislocation, k
is Boltzmann’s constant, Tis the absolute temperature
andcthe local impurity concentration at a point near
the dislocation where the binding energy is V.T h i s
is known as the dilute or Maxwellian atmosphere.
Clearly, the form of an atmosphere will be governedby the concentration of solute atoms at the sites of
maximum binding energy, V
maxand for a given alloy
(i.e.c0andVmaxﬁxed) this concentration will be
cVmaxDc0exp⊿Vmax/kT/triangleleft (7.12)
as long as cVmaxis less than unity. The value of cVmax
depends only on the temperature, and as the temper-
ature is lowered cVmaxwill eventually rise to unity.
By deﬁnition the atmosphere will then have passed
from a dilute to a condensed state. The temperature atwhich this occurs is known as the condensation tem-
perature T
c, and can be obtained by substituting the
valuecVmaxD1 in equation (7.12) when
TcDVmax/kln⊿1/c0/triangleleft (7.13)
Substitutingthevalueof Vmaxforiron,i.e.1
2eV inthis
equation we ﬁnd that only a very small concentration
of carbon or nitrogen is necessary to give a condensed
atmosphere at room temperature, and with the usualconcentration strong yielding behaviour is expected up
to temperatures of about 400
°C.
In the fcc structure although the locking between a
solute atom and a dislocation is likely to be weaker,
condensed atmospheres are still possible if this weak-
ness can be compensated for by sufﬁciently increasingthe concentration of the solution. This may be why
examplesofyieldinginfccmaterialshavebeenmainly
obtained from alloys. Solid solution alloys of alu-minium usually contain less than 0.1 at. % of solute
element, and these show yielding in single crystals
only at low temperature (e.g. liquid nitrogen tempera-ture,/NUL196
°C) whereas supersaturatedalloysshowevi-
dence of strong yielding even in polycrystals at room

ﬁt value ε'0.12 which corresponds to VmaxD1

% alloy has a condensation temperature TcD250 K.
Copper-based alloys, on the other hand, usually form
extensive solid solutions, and, consequently, concen-trated alloys may exhibit strong yielding phenomena.
The best-known example is ˛-brass and, because
V

has a condensation temperature Tc'300 K. At low
zinc concentrations (1–10%) the yield point in brassis probably solely due to the segregation of zinc atomsto dislocations. At higher concentrations, however, itmay also be due to short-range order.
7.4.8 Dislocation locking and temperature
The binding of a solute atom to a dislocation is shortrange in nature, and is effective only over an atomicdistance or so (Figure 7.29). Moreover, the dislocationline is ﬂexible and this enables yielding to begin bythrowing forward a small length of dislocation line,only a few atomic spacings long, beyond the positionmarked x
2. The applied stress then separates the rest
of the dislocation line from its anchorage by pulling
the sides of this loop outward along the dislocationline, i.e. by double kink movement. Such a breakawayprocess would lead to a yield stress which dependssensitively on temperature, as shown in Figure 7.30a.It is observed, however, that k

dence parameter in the Hall–Petch equation, in mostannealed bcc metals is almost independent of tem-perature down to the range ( <100 K) where twinning
occurs, and that practically all the large temperature-dependence is due to /ESC
i(see Figure 7.30b). To explain
this observation it is argued that when locked disloca-tions exist initially in the material, yielding starts byunpinning them if they are weakly locked (this corre-sponds to the condition envisaged by Cottrell–Bilby),but if they are strongly locked it starts instead by

the creation of new dislocations at points of stress
concentration. This is an athermal process and thus
kyis almost independent of temperature. Because of
the rapid diffusion of interstitial elements the con-
ventional annealing and normalizing treatments should
commonly produce strong locking. In support of thistheory, it is observed that k
yis dependent on tempera-
ture in the very early stages of ageing following either
straining or quenching but on subsequent ageing ky
becomes temperature-independent. The interpretation
ofkytherefore depends on the degree of ageing.
Direct observations of crystals that have yielded
show that the majority of the strongly anchored dis-locations remain locked and do not participate in the
yielding phenomenon. Thus large numbers of dislo-
cations are generated during yielding by some othermechanism than breaking away from Cottrell atmo-spheres,andtherapiddislocationmultiplication,which
can take place at the high stress levels, is now con-
sidered the most likely possibility. Prolonged ageingtends to produce coarse precipitates along the disloca-
tion line and unpinning by bowing out between them
should easily occur before grain boundary creation.Thisunpinningprocesswouldalsogive k

7.4.9 Inhomogeneity interaction
A different type of elastic interaction can exist which
arises from the different elastic properties of thesolvent matrix and the region near a solute. Such an
inhomogeneity interaction has been analysed for both
a rigid and a soft spherical region; the former cor-responds to a relatively hard impurity atom and the
latter to a vacant lattice site. The results indicate that
the interaction energy is of the form B/r
2whereBis a
constant involving elastic constants and atomic size. Itis generally believed that the inhomogeneity effect is

This reduces to the simpler equation (7.14) when the
exponent is small, and is found to be in good agree-
ment with the process of segregation and precipitationon dislocations in several bcc metals. For carbon in˛-Fe, Harper determined the fraction of solute atom

the slope of the line is /EM/SUB⊿AD/kT/triangleleftand evaluation of
this slope at a series of temperatures allows the acti-
vation energy for the process to be determined from
an Arrhenius plot. The value obtained for ˛-iron is

7.4.11 Inﬂuence of grain boundaries on
plasticity
It might be thought that when a stress is applied
to a polycrystalline metal, every grain in the sampledeforms as if it were an unconstrained single crys-
tal. This is not the case, however, and the fact thatthe aggregate does not deform in this manner is indi-
cated by the high yield stress of polycrystals compared
with that of single crystals. This increased strength
of polycrystals immediately poses the question–is the
hardness of a grain caused by the presence of the grain
boundary or by the orientation difference of the neigh-
bouring grains? It is now believed that the latter isthe case but that the structure of the grain boundary
itself may be of importance in special circumstances
such as when brittle ﬁlms, due to bismuth in copper
or cementite in steel, form around the grains or when
the grains slip past each other along their boundaries
during high-temperature creep. The importance of the
orientation change across a grain boundary to the pro-
cess of slip has been demonstrated by experiments on
‘bamboo’-type specimens, i.e. where the grain bound-aries are parallel to each other and all perpendicular to
theaxisoftension.Initially,deformationoccursbyslip
only in those grains most favourably oriented, but later
spreads to all the other grains as those grains which
are deformed ﬁrst, work harden. It is then found that
each grain contains wedge-shaped areas near the grain
boundary, as shown in Figure 7.31a, where slip doesnot operate, which indicates that the continuance of
slip from one grain to the next is difﬁcult. From these
observations it is natural to enquire what happens in a
completely polycrystalline metal where the slip planes
must in all cases make contact with a grain bound-
ary. It will be clear that the polycrystalline aggregate
must be stronger because, unlike the deformation of
bamboo-type samples where it is not necessary to raise
the stress sufﬁciently high to operate those slip planeswhich made contact with a grain boundary, all the slip
planes within any grain of a polycrystalline aggregate
make contact with a grain boundary, but, nevertheless,
have to be operated. The importance of the grain size

on a strength is emphasized by Figure 7.30b, which
showsthevariationinloweryieldstress, /ESCy,withgrain
diameter, 2 d, for low-carbon steel. The smaller the
grain size, the higher the yield strength according to a
relation of the form
/ESCyD/ESCiCkd/NUL1/2(7.18)
where/ESCiis a lattice friction stress and ka constant
usually denoted kyto indicate yielding. Because of
the difﬁculties experienced by a dislocation in moving
from one grain to another, the process of slip in
a polycrystalline aggregate does not spread to each
grain by forcing a dislocation through the boundary.Instead, the slip band which is held up at the boundary
gives rise to a stress concentration at the head of
the pile-up group of dislocations which acts with the
applied stress and is sufﬁcient to trigger off sources
in neighbouring grains. If /FS
iis the stress a slip band
could sustain if there were no resistance to slip across
the grain boundary, i.e. the friction stress, and /FSthe
higher stress sustained by a slip band in a polycrystal,
then⊿/FS/NUL/FSi/triangleleftrepresents the resistance offered by the
boundary, which reaches a limiting value when slip
is induced in the next grain. The inﬂuence of grain
size can be explained if the length of the slip band
is proportional to das shown in Figure 7.31(b). Thus,
since the stress concentration a short distance rfrom
the end of the slip band is proportional to ⊿d/4r/triangleleft1/2,
the maximum shear stress at a distance rahead of a
slip band carrying an applied stress /FSin a polycrystal
is given by ⊿/FS/NUL/FSi/triangleleft[d/4r]1/2and lies in the plane of
the slip band. If this maximum stress has to reach avalue/FS
maxto operate a new source at a distance rthen
⊿/FS/NUL/FSi/triangleleft[d/4r]1/2D/FSmax
or, rearranging,
/FSD/FSiC⊿/FSmax2r1/2/triangleleftd/NUL1/2
which may be written as
/FSD/FSiCksd/NUL1/2
It then follows that the tensile ﬂow curve of a poly-
crystal is given by
/ESCDm⊿/FSiCksd/NUL1/2/triangleleft (7.19)
wheremis the orientation factor relating the applied
tensile stress /ESCto the shear stress, i.e. /ESCDm/FS.F o r

of 2 as discussed, but in polycrystals deformationoccurs in less favourably oriented grains and some-
times (e.g. hexagonal, intermetallics, etc.) on ‘hard’
systems, and so the m-factor is signiﬁcantly higher.
From equation (7.18) it can be seen that /ESC

Whilethereisanorientationfactoronamacroscopic
scale in developing the critical shear stress within the
various grains of a polycrystal, so there is a local ori-
entation factor in operating a dislocation source aheadof a blocked slip band. The slip plane of the sources
will not, in general, lie in the plane of maximum shear
stress, and hence /FSmaxwill need to be such that the
shear stress, /FScrequired to operate the new source
must be generated in the slip plane of the source. In
general, the local orientation factor dealing with the
orientation relationship of adjacent grains will differ
from the macroscopic factor of slip plane orientation

hence the parameter kin the Petch equation is given
bykDm2/FScr1/2.
It is clear from the above treatment that the parame-
terkdepends essentially on two main factors. The ﬁrst
is the stress to operate a source dislocation, and this
depends on the extent to which the dislocations are
anchored or locked by impurity atoms. Strong locking
implies a large /FScand hence a large k; the converse is
true for weak locking. The second factor is contained
in the parameter mwhich depends on the number of
available slip systems. A multiplicity of slip systems
enhances the possibility for plastic deformation and so
implies a small k. A limited number of slip systems
available would imply a large value of k. It then fol-
lows, as shown in Figure 7.32, that for (1) fcc metals,
which have weakly locked dislocations and a multi-plicity of slip systems, kwill generally be small, i.e.
there is only a small grain size dependence of the ﬂow
stress, (2) cph metals, kwill be large because of the
limited slip systems, and (3) bcc metals, because of
the strong locking, kwill be large.
Each grain does not deform as a single crystal in
simple slip, since, if this were so, different grains
would then deform in different directions with the
result that voids would be created at the grain bound-
aries. Except in high-temperature creep, where the
grains slide past each other along their boundaries, this
does not happen and each grain deforms in coherence
with its neighbouring grains. However, the fact that

size-dependence of the yield stress for crystals of different
crystal structure .
220Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
the continuity of the metal is maintained during plas-
tic deformation must mean that each grain is deformedinto a shape that is dictated by the deformation of its
neighbours. Such behaviour will, of course, require the
operation of several slip systems, and von Mises has
shownthattoallowthisunrestrictedchangeofshapeof
a grain requires at least ﬁve independent shear modes.
The deformation of metal crystals with cubic structure
easily satisﬁes this condition so that the polycrystalsof these metals usually exhibit considerable ductility,
and the stress–strain curve generally lies close to that
of single crystals of extreme orientations deforming
under multiple slip conditions. The hexagonal metals
do, however, show striking differences between their
single crystal and polycrystalline behaviour. This is
because single crystals of these metals deform by a
process of basal plane slip, but the three shear sys-
tems (two independent) which operate do not pro-vide enough independent shear mechanisms to allow
unrestricted changes of shape in polycrystals. Conse-
quently,topreventgapsopeningupatgrainboundaries
during the deformation of polycrystals, some addi-
tional shear mechanisms, such as non-basal slip and
mechanical twinning, must operate. Hence, because
the resolved stress for non-basal slip and twinningis greater than that for basal-plane slip, yielding in a
polycrystal is prevented until the applied stress is high
enough to deform by these mechanisms.
7.4.12 Superplasticity
A number of materials, particularly two-phase eutec-
tic or eutectoid alloys, have been observed to exhibit
largeelongations ⊿³1000%/triangleleftwithoutfracture,andsuch
behaviour has been termed superplasticity. Several
metallurgical factors have been put forward to explain
superplastic behaviour and it is now generally recog-
nizedthattheeffectcanbeproducedinmaterialseither(1) with a particular structural condition or (2) tested
under special test conditions. The particular structural
condition is that the material has a very ﬁne grain size
and the presence of a two-phase structure is usually of
importance in maintaining this ﬁne grain size during
testing. Materials which exhibit superplastic behaviour
under special test conditions are those for which a
phase boundary moves through the strained material
during the test (e.g. during temperature cycling).
In general, the superplastic material exhibits a high
strain-rate sensitivity. Thus the plastic ﬂow of a solid
may be represented by the relation
/ESCDKPε
m(7.20)
where/ESCis the stress, Pεthe strain-rate and man
exponentgenerallyknownasthestrain-ratesensitivity.
WhenmD1 the ﬂow stress is directly proportional to
strain rate and the material behaves as a Newtonian
viscous ﬂuid, such as hot glass. Superplastic materials
are therefore characterized by high m-values, since
this leads to increased stability against necking in
a tensile test. Thus, for a tensile specimen length lwith cross-sectional area Aunder an applied load P

we obtain

hence once necking starts the process rapidly leads
to failure. When mD1, the rate of change of area is
independent of Aand, as a consequence, any irreg-
ularities in specimen geometry are not accentuatedduring deformation. The resistance to necking there-fore depends sensitively on m, and increases markedly

/ESCDK1εnPεm(7.22)
and in this case, the stability against necking depends
on a factor ⊿1/NULn/NULm/triangleleft/m, butn-values are not nor-
mally very high. Superplastic materials such as Zn–Al
eutectoid, Pb–Sn eutectic, Al–Cu eutectic, etc. have
mvalues approaching unity at elevated temperatures.
The total elongation increases as mincreases and
with increasing microstructural ﬁneness of the mate-rial (grain-size or lamella spacing) the tendency for
superplastic behaviour is increased. Two-phase struc-
tures are advantageous in maintaining a ﬁne grain sizeduring testing, but exceptionally high ductilities havebeen produced in several commercially pure metals
(e.g. Ni, Zn and Mg), for which the ﬁne grain size was
maintained during testing at a particular strain-rate andtemperature.
It follows that there must be several possible con-
ditions leading to superplasticity. Generally, it is
observed metallographically that the grain structureremains remarkably equiaxed during extensive defor-mation and that grain boundary sliding is a commondeformationmodeinseveralsuperplasticalloys.While
grain boundary sliding can contribute to the overall
deformation by relaxing the ﬁve independent mecha-nisms of slip, it cannot give rise to large elongationswithout bulk ﬂow of material (e.g. grain boundary
migration).Inpolycrystals,triplejunctionsobstructthe
sliding process and give rise to a low m-value. Thus to
increase the rate sensitivity of the boundary shear it isnecessary to lower the resistance to sliding from bar-riers, relative to the viscous drag of the boundary; this
can be achieved by grain boundary migration. Indeed,
it is observed that superplasticityis controlled by grainboundary diffusion.
The complete explanation of superplasticity is still
being developed, but it is already clear that during
deformation individual grains or groups of grains withsuitably aligned boundaries will tend to slide. Sliding

boundary, when the local stress generates dislocationswhich slip across the blocked grain and pile up at theoppositeboundaryuntilthebackstresspreventsfurthergeneration of dislocations and thus further sliding. Atthe temperature of the test, dislocations at the head ofthepile-upcanclimbintoandmovealonggrainbound-aries to annihilation sites. The continual replacementofthesedislocationswouldpermitgrainboundaryslid-ing at a rate governed by the rate of dislocation climb,which in turn is governed by grain boundary diffusion.It is important that any dislocations created by localstresses are able to traverse yielded grains and thisis possible only if the ‘dislocation cell size’ is largerthan,oratleastoftheorderof,thegrainsize,i.e.afewmicrons. At high strain-rates and low temperatures the
dislocations begin to tangle and form cell structures
and superplasticity then ceases.
The above conditions imply that any metal in which
the grain size remains ﬁne during deformation couldbehave superplastically; this conclusion is borne out inpractice. The stability of grain size can, however, beachieved more readily with a ﬁne micro-duplex struc-ture as observed in some Fe–20Cr–6Ni alloys whenhot worked to produce a ﬁne dispersion of austen-ite and ferrite. Such stainless steels have an attrac-tive combination of properties (strength, toughness,fatigue strength, weldability and corrosion resistance)andunliketheusualrange oftwo-phasestainlesssteelshave good hot workability if 0.5Ti is added to pro-duce a random distribution of TiC rather than Cr

process is slow, the loads required are also low and theprocess can be advantageous in the press-forming ﬁeldto replace some of the present expensive and complexforming technology.
7.5 Mechanical twinning
7.5.1 Crystallography of twinning
Mechanical twinning plays only a minor part in thedeformation of the common metals such as copperor aluminium, and its study has consequently been
neglected. Nevertheless, twinning does occur in all the
common crystal structures under some conditions of
deformation. Table 7.2 shows the appropriate twinningelements for the common structures.
The geometrical aspects of twinning can be
represented with the aid of a unit sphere shown inFigure 7.33. The twinningplane k
1intersects the plane
of the drawing in the shear direction /DC11. On twinning
the unit sphere is distorted to an ellipsoid of equalvolume, and the shear plane k
1remains unchanged
during twinning, while all other planes become tilted.Distortion of planes occurs in all cases except k
1
and k2. The shear strain, s, at unit distance from
the twinning plane is related to the angle betweenk
1and k2. Thus the amount of shear is ﬁxed by the
crystallographic nature of the two undistorted planes.In the bcc lattice, the two undistorted planes are the
⊿112 /triangleleftand ⊿11
2/triangleleftplanes, displacement occurring in a
[111] directiona distance of 0.707 lattice vectors. Thetwinning elements are thus:
k1 k2 /DC11 /DC12Shear
⊿112 /triangleleft⊿112/triangleleft[111] [111] 0.707
where k1andk2denote the ﬁrst and second undistorted
planes, respectively, and /DC11and /DC12denote directions
lying in k1and k2, respectively, perpendicular to the
line of intersection of these planes. k1is also called the
composition or twinning plane, while /DC11is called the
shear direction. The twins consist of regions of crystal
Figure 7.33 Crystallography of twinning .
222Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
in which a particular set of f112gplanes (the k1set
of planes) is homogeneously sheared by 0.707 in a
h111idirection (the /DC11direction). The same atomic
arrangement may be visualized by a shear of 1.414 inthereverse h111idirection, but this larger shear has
never been observed.
7.5.2 Nucleation and growth of twins
During the development of mechanical twins, thin
lamellae appear very quickly ( ³speed of sound) and
these thicken with increasing stress by the steady
movement of the twin interface. New twins are usuallyformed in bursts and are sometimes accompanied by a
sharp audible click which coincides with the appear-
ance of irregularities in the stress–strain curve, as
showninFigure 7.34.Therapidproductionofclicksis
responsible for the so-called twinning cry (e.g. in tin).
Although most metals show a general reluctance
to twin, when tested under suitable conditions they
can usually be made to do so. As mentioned in
Section 7.3.1, the shear process involved in twinning
must occur by the movement of partial dislocationsand, consequently, the stress to cause twinning will
depend not only on the line tension of the source dis-
location, as in the case of slip, but also on the surface
tension of the twin boundary. The stress to cause twin-
ning is, therefore, usually greater than that required forslip and at room temperature deformation will nearly
always occur by slip in preference to twinning. As thedeformation temperature is lowered the critical shear
stress for slip increases, and then, because the general
stress level will be high, the process of deformation
twinning is more likely.
Twinning is most easily achieved in metals of cph
structure where, because of the limited number of
slip systems, twinning is an essential and unavoidable
mechanism of deformation in polycrystalline speci-mens (see Section 7.4.11), but in single crystals the
orientation of the specimen, the stress level and the
temperature of deformation are all important factorsin the twinning process. In metals of the bcc structure
twinning may be induced by impact at room tempera-
ture or with more normal strain rates at low tempera-
ture where the critical shear stress for slip is very high.
In contrast, only a few fcc metals have been made totwin, even at low temperatures.
In zinc single crystals it is observed that there is no
well-deﬁned critical resolved shear stress for twinningsuch as exists for slip, and that a very high stress
indeed is necessary to nucleate twins. In most crystals,
slipusuallyoccursﬁrstandtwinnucleiarethencreated
by means of the very high stress concentration which
exists at dislocation pile-ups. Once formed, the twinscan propagate provided the resolved shear stress is
higher than a critical value, because the stress to
propagate a twin is much lower than that to nucleateit. This can be demonstrated by deforming a crystal
oriented in such a way that basal slip is excluded,

i.e. when the basal planes are nearly parallel to the
specimen axis. Even in such an oriented crystal it isfound that the stress to cause twinning is higher than
that for slip on non-basal planes. In this case, non-
basalslipoccursﬁrstsothatwhenadislocationpile-up

that an avalanche or burst of twins results.
It is also believed that in the bcc metals twin
nucleation is more difﬁcult than twin propagation. One
possible mechanism is that nucleation is brought about
by the stress concentration at the head of a piled-up
array of dislocations produced by a burst of slip as
a Frank–Read source operates. Such a behaviour isfavoured by impact loading, and it is well known that
twin lamellae known as Neumann bands are produced
this way in ˛-iron at room temperature. At normal
strain rates, however, it should be easier to produce
a slip burst suitable for twin nucleation in a material
with strongly locked dislocations, i.e. one with a large
kvalue (as deﬁned by equation (7.19)) than one in
which the dislocation locking is relatively slight(small
kvalues). In this context it is interesting to note
that both niobium and tantalum have a small kvalue
and, although they can be made to twin, do so with
reluctance compared, for example, with ˛-iron.
In all the bcc metals the ﬂow stress increases so
rapidly with decreasing temperature (see Figure 7.30),
that even with moderate strain rates ⊿10
/NUL4s/NUL1/triangleleft˛-iron
willtwin at 77 K, while niobiumwith itssmaller valueofktwinsat 20 K. The type of stress–strainbehaviour
for niobium is shown in Figure 7.34a. The pattern of
behaviour is characterized by small amounts of slip
interspersed between extensive bursts of twinning in
the early stages of deformation. Twins, once formed,
may themselves act as barriers, allowing further dislo-
cation pile-up and further twin nucleation. The action
of twins as barriers to slip dislocations could presum-
ably account for the rapid work-hardening observedat 20 K.
Fcc metals do not readily deform by twinning but
it can occur at low temperatures, and even at 0
°C, in
favourably oriented crystals. The apparent restriction
of twinning to certain orientations and low tempera-
tures may be ascribed to the high shear stress attained
in tests on crystals with these orientations, since the
stress necessary to produce twinning is high. Twinning
has been conﬁrmed in heavily rolled copper. The exact
mechanism for this twinning is not known, except that
it must occur by the propagation of a half-dislocationand its associated stacking fault across each plane of a
set of parallel ⊿111 /triangleleftplanes. For this process the half-
dislocation must climb onto successive twin planes, as
below for bcc iron.
7.5.3 Effect of impurities on twinning
It is well established that solid solution alloying
favours twinning in fcc metals. For example, sil-
ver–gold alloys twin far more readily than the pure
metals. Attempts have been made to correlate thiseffect with stacking fault energy and it has been
shown that the twinning stress of copper-based alloysincreases with increasing stacking fault energy. Twin-ning is also favoured by solid solution alloying inbcc metals, and alloys of Mo–Re, W–Re and Nb–V
readily twin at room temperature. In this case it
has been suggested that the lattice frictional stressis increased and the ability to cross-slip reduced byalloying, thereby conﬁning slip dislocations to bandswhere stress multiplication conducive to twin nucle-ation occurs.
7.5.4 Effect of prestrain on twinning
Twinning can be suppressed in most metals by a cer-tain amount of prestrain; the ability to twin may berestored by an ageing treatment. It has been suggestedthat the effect may be due to the differing dislocationdistribution produced under different conditions. Forexample,niobiumwillnormallytwinat /NUL196
°C,when
a heterogeneous arrangement of elongated screw dis-
locations capable of creating the necessary stress con-centrations are formed. Room temperature prestrain,however, inhibits twin formation as the regular net-work of dislocations produced provides more mobile
dislocations and homogenizes the deformation.
7.5.5 Dislocation mechanism of twinning
In contrast to slip, the shear involved in the twinningprocessishomogeneousthroughouttheentiretwinning
region, and each atom plane parallel to the twinningplane moves over the one below it by only a fractionof a lattice spacing in the twinning direction. Never-theless, mechanical twinning is thought to take place
by a dislocation mechanism for the same reasons as
slip but the dislocations that cause twinning are partialand not unit dislocations. From the crystallography ofthe process it can be shown that twinning in the cphlattice, in addition to a simple shear on the twinning
plane, must be accompanied by a localized rearrange-
ment of the atoms, and furthermore, only in the bcclattice does the process of twinning consist of a simpleshear on the twinning plane (e.g. a twinned structure
in this lattice can be produced by a shear of 1 /p
2i n
ah111idirection on a f112gplane).
An examination of Figure 7.9 shows that the main
problem facing any theory of twinning is to explainhow twinning develops homogeneously through suc-cessive planes of the lattice. This could be accom-plished by the movement of a single twinning (par-tial) dislocation successively from plane to plane. One
suggestion, similar in principle to the crystal growth
mechanism, is the pole-mechanism proposed by Cot-trell and Bilby illustrated in Figure 7.35a. Here, OA,OB, and OC are dislocation lines. The twinning dis-location is OC, which produces the correct shear as it
sweeps through the twin plane about its point of emer-
gence O, and OA and OB form the pole dislocation,being partly or wholly of screw character with a pitch

equal to the spacing of the twinning layers. The twin-
ning dislocation rotates round the pole dislocation andin doing so, not only produces a monolayer sheet oftwinned crystal but also climbs up the ‘pole’ to thenext layer. The process is repeated and a thick layerof twin is built up.
The dislocation reaction involved is as follows. The
line AOB represents a unit dislocation with a Burgersvector a/2[111] and that part OB of the line lies
in the ⊿112 /triangleleftplane. Then, under the action of stress
dissociation of this dislocation can occur according tothe reaction
a/2[111] /NUL! a/3[112] Ca/6[11
1]
The dislocation with vector a/6[111] forms a line
OC lying in one of the other f112gtwin planes (e.g.
the⊿121 /triangleleftplane) and produces the correct twinning
shear. The line OB is left with a Burgers vector
a/3[112] which is of pure edge type and sessile in
the⊿112 /triangleleftplane.
7.5.6 Twinning and fracture
Ithasbeensuggestedthatatwin,likeagrainboundary,
may present a strong barrier to slip and that a crackcan be initiated by the pile-up of slip dislocations atthetwininterface(see Figure 8.32). In addition,cracksmay be initiated by the intersection of twins, andexamples are common in molybdenum, silicon–iron(bcc) and zinc (cph). Figure 7.35b shows a very goodexample of crack nucleation in 3% silicon–iron; thecrack has formed along an f001gcleavage plane at
the intersection of two f112gtwins, and part of thecrack has developed along one of the twins in a zigzag
manner while still retaining f001gcleavage facets.
In tests at low temperature on bcc and cph metals
both twinning and fracture readily occur, and thishas led to two conﬂicting views. First, that twins arenucleated by the high stress concentrations associatedwith fracture, and second, that the formation of twinsactually initiates the fracture. It is probable that botheffects occur.
7.6 Strengthening and hardening
mechanisms
7.6.1 Point defect hardening
The introduction of point defects into materials to pro-
duce an excess concentration of either vacancies orinterstitials often gives rise to a signiﬁcant change inmechanicalproperties(Figures 7.36and7.37).Foralu-minium the shape of the stress–strain curve is verydependent on the rate of cooling and a large increasein the yield stress may occur after quenching. WehavealreadyseeninChapter 4thatquenched-invacan-cies result in clustered vacancy defects and these mayharden the material. Similarly, irradiation by high-energy particles may produce irradiation-hardening(see Figure 7.37). Information on the mechanisms ofhardening can be obtained from observation of thedependence of the lower yield stress on grain size.The results, reproduced in Figure 7.37b, show that the
relation /ESC
yD/ESCiCkyd/NUL1/2, which is a general relation
describing the propagation of yielding in materials, is
obeyed.

(b) variation of yield stress with grain size and neutron dose (after Adams and Higgins, 1959) .
This dependence of the yield stress, /ESCy,o ng r a i n
size indicates that the hardening produced by point
defects introduced by quenching or irradiation, is of
two types: (1) an initial dislocation source hardening
and (2) a general lattice hardening which persists after
theinitialyielding.The kyterm wouldseem toindicate
that the pinning of dislocations may be attributed to
point defects in the form of coarsely spaced jogs,
and the electron-microscope observations of jogged
dislocations would seem to conﬁrm this.
The lattice friction term /ESCiis clearly responsi-
ble for the general level of the stress–strain curve
after yielding and arises from the large density of
dislocation defects. However, the exact mechanismswhereby loops and tetrahedra give rise to an increased
ﬂow stress is still controversial. Vacancy clusters are
believed to be formed in situby the disturbance intro-
duced by the primary collision, and hence it is not
surprising that neutron irradiation at 4 K hardens the
material, and that thermal activation is not essential.
Unlike dispersion-hardened alloys, the deformation
of irradiated or quenched metals is characterized by a
low initial rate of work hardening (see Figure 7.36).
This has been shown to be due to the sweeping out
of loops and defect clusters by the glide disloca-
tions, leading to the formation of cleared channels.
Diffusion-controlled mechanisms are not thought to be
important since defect-free channels are produced by
226Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
deformation at 4 K. The removal of prismatic loops
both unfaulted and faulted and tetrahedra can occuras a result of the strong coalescence interactions withscrews toform helical conﬁgurationsand joggeddislo-cationswhen the glidingdislocationsand defects makecontact. Clearly, the sweeping-up process occurs onlyif the helical and jogged conﬁgurations can glide eas-
ily. Resistance to glide will arise from jogs not lying
in slip planes and also from the formation of sessilejogs (e.g. Lomer–Cottrell dislocations in fcc crystals).
7.6.2 Work-hardening
7.6.2.1 Theoretical treatment
The properties of a material are altered by cold-
working, i.e. deformation at a low temperature rel-ative to its melting point, but not all the properties
are improved, for although the tensile strength, yield
strength and hardness are increased, the plasticity andgeneral ability to deform decreases. Moreover, thephysicalpropertiessuchaselectricalconductivity,den-sity and others are all lowered. Of these many changesin properties, perhaps the most outstanding are thosethat occur in the mechanical properties;the yield stress
of mild steel, for example, may be raised by cold work
from 170 up to 1050 MN/m
2.
Such changes in mechanical properties are, of
course, of interest theoretically, but they are also
of great importance in industrial practice. This isbecause the rate at which the material hardens duringdeformationinﬂuencesboththepowerrequiredandthemethod of working in the various shaping operations,while the magnitude of the hardness introduced
governs the frequency with which the component must
be annealed (always an expensive operation) to enablefurther working to be continued.
Since plastic ﬂow occurs by a dislocation mecha-
nism the fact that work-hardening occurs means that itbecomes difﬁcult for dislocations to move as the strainincreases. All theories of work-hardening depend on
this assumption, and the basic idea of hardening, put
forward by Taylor in 1934, is that some dislocationsbecome ‘stuck’ inside the crystal and act as sourcesof internal stress which oppose the motion of othergliding dislocations.
One simple way in which two dislocations could
become stuck is by elastic interaction. Thus, two par-
allel edge dislocations of opposite sign moving onparallelslipplanesinanysub-grainmaybecomestuck,as a result of the interaction discussed in Chapter 4.G. I. Taylor assumed that dislocations become stuckafter travelling an average distance, L, while the den-
sity of dislocations reaches /SUB, i.e. work-hardening is
due to the dislocations getting in each other’s way.
The ﬂow stress is then the stress necessary to movea dislocation in the stress ﬁeld of those dislocationssurroundingit.Thisstress /FSisquitegenerallygiven by

In his theory Taylor considered only a two-
dimensional model of a cold-worked metal. However,because plastic deformation arises from the movementof dislocation loops from a source, it is more
appropriate to assume that when the plastic strain is
/CR,Ndislocation loops of side L(if we assume for
convenience that square loops are emitted) have beengiven off per unit volume. The resultant plastic strainis then given by
/CRDNL

Combining these equations, the stress–strain relation
/FSDconst. ⊿b/L/triangleleft1/2/CR1/2(7.26)
is obtained. Taylor assumed Lto be a constant, i.e.
the slip lines are of constant length, which results in a
parabolic relationship between /FSand/CR.
Taylor’s assumption that during cold work the den-
sity of dislocations increases has been amply veri-ﬁed, and indeed the parabolic relationship betweenstress and strain is obeyed, to a ﬁrst approximation,in many polycrystalline aggregates where deformationin all grains takes place by multiple slip. Experimen-
tal work on single crystals shows, however, that the
work- or strain-hardening curve may deviate consider-ably from parabolic behaviour, and depends not onlyon crystal structure but also on other variables such ascrystal orientation, purity and surface conditions (seeFigures 7.39 and 7.40).
The crystal structure is important (see Figure 7.39)
in that single crystals of some hexagonal metals sliponly on one family of slip planes, those parallel tothe basal plane, and these metals show a low rate of
Mechanical behaviour of materials 227

work-hardening. The plastic part of the stress–strain
curve is also more nearly linear than parabolic witha slope which is extremely small: this slope (d /FS/d/CR)
becomes even smaller with increasing temperature of
deformation. Cubic crystals, on the other hand, are
capable of deforming in a complex manner on morethan one slip system, and these metals normally showa strong work-hardening behaviour. The inﬂuence oftemperature depends on the stress level reached dur-ing deformation and on other factors which must beconsidered in greater detail. However, even in cubiccrystals the rate of work-hardening may be extremelysmall if the crystal is restricted to slip on a singleslip system. Such behaviour points to the conclusionthat strong work-hardening is caused by the mutual
interference of dislocations gliding on intersecting slip
planes.
Many theories of work-hardening similar to that of
Taylor exist but all are oversimpliﬁed, since work-hardening depends not so much on individual dislo-cations as on the group behaviour of large numbers ofthem. It is clear, therefore, that a theoretical treatmentwhich would describe the complete stress–strain rela-
tionship is difﬁcult, and consequently the present-day
approach is to examine the various stages of hardeningand then attempt to explain the mechanisms likely to
give rise to the different stages. The work-hardening
behaviour in metals with a cubic structure is morecomplex than in most other structures because of thevariety of slip systems available, and it is for this rea-
son that much of the experimental evidence is related
to these metals, particularly those with fcc structures.
7.6.2.2 Three-stage hardening
The stress–straincurve of a fcc singlecrystal is shown
in Figure 7.40 and three regions of hardening are
experimentally distinguishable. Stage I, or the easyglide region, immediately follows the yield point and
is characterized by a low rate of work hardening /DC2
1
up to several per cent glide; the length of this region
depends on orientation, purity and size of the crystals.
The hardening rate ⊿/DC21//SYN/triangleleft¾10/NUL4and is of the same
order as for hexagonal metals. Stage II, or the linear
hardening region, shows a rapid increase in work-
hardening rate. The ratio ⊿/DC211//SYN/triangleleftD⊿d/FS/d/CR/triangleleft//SYNis of
the same order of magnitude for all fcc metals, i.e.1/300 although this is ³1/150 for orientations at the
corners of the stereographictriangle. In thisstageshort
slip lines are formed during straining quite suddenly,i.e. in a short increment of stress /FS, and thereafter do
not grow either in length or intensity. The mean length
of the slip lines, L³25
µm decreases with increasing
strain. Stage III, or the parabolic hardening region, theonset of which is markedly dependent on temperature,
exhibits a low rate of work-hardening, /DC2
111,a n dt h e
appearance of coarse slip bands. This stage sets in ata strain which increases with decreasing temperature
and is probably associated with the annihilation of
dislocations as a consequence of cross-slip.
The low stacking fault energy metals exhibit all
three work-hardening stages at room temperature, but
metals with a high stacking fault energy often show
only two stages of hardening. It is found, for example,that at 78 K aluminium behaves like copper at room
temperature and exhibits all three stages, but at room
temperature and above, stage II is not clearly devel-oped and stage III starts before stage II becomes at
all predominant. This difference between aluminium
and the noble metals is not due only to the differencein melting point but also to the difference in stackingfault energies which affects the width of extended dis-
locations. The main effect of a change of temperature
of deformation is, however, a change in the onset ofstage III;thelowerthetemperatureofdeformation,the
higher is the stress /FS
111corresponding to the onset of
stage III.
Because the ﬂow stress of a metal may be affected
by a change of temperature or strain-rate, it has been
found convenient to think of the stress as made up of
two parts according to the relation
/FSD/FSsC/FSg
228Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
where /FSsis that part of the ﬂow stress which is
dependent on temperature apart from the variation of
the elastic modulus /SYNwith temperature, and /FSgis
a temperature-independent contribution. The relative
importance of /FSsand/FSgcan be studied conveniently
by measuring the dependence of ﬂow stress on tem-
perature or strain rate, i.e. the change in ﬂow stress /FS
on changing the temperature or strain rate, as function
of deformation.
The Stage I easy glide region in cubic crystals, with
its small linear hardening, corresponds closely to the
hardening of cph crystals where only one glide planeoperates. It occurs in crystals oriented to allow only
one glide system to operate, i.e. for orientations near
the [011] pole of the unit triangle (Figure 7.13). Inthis case the slip distance is large, of the order of thespecimen diameter, withthe probabilityof dislocations
slipping out of the crystal. Electron microscope obser-
vations have shown that the slip lines on the surfaceare very long ( ³1 mm) and closely spaced, and that
the slip steps are small corresponding to the passage
of only a few dislocations. This behaviour obviouslydepends on such variables as sample size and oxide
ﬁlms, since these inﬂuence the probability of disloca-
tionspassingoutofthecrystal.Itisalsotobeexpectedthat the ﬂow stress in easy glide will be governed bythe ease with which sources begin to operate, since
there is no slip on a secondary slip system to interfere
with the movement of primary glide dislocations.
As soon as another glide system becomes activated
thereisastronginteractionbetweendislocationsonthe
primary and secondary slip systems, which gives riseto a steep increase in work-hardening. It is reasonable
to expect that easy glide should end, and turbulent
ﬂow begin, when the crystal reaches an orientation forwhich two or more slip systems are equally stressed,i.e. for orientations on the symmetry line between
[001] and [111]. However, easy glide generally ends
before symmetrical orientations are reached and this isprincipally due to the formation of deformation bands
to accommodate the rotation of the glide plane in ﬁxed
grips during tensile tests. This rotation leads to a highresolved stress on the secondary slip system, and its
operation gives rise to those lattice irregularities which
cause some dislocations to become ‘stopped’ in thecrystal. The transformation to Stage II then occurs.
The characteristic feature of deformation in Stage II
is that slip takes place on both the primary and sec-
ondary slip systems. As a result, several new lat-tice irregularities may be formed which will include
(1) forest dislocations, (2) Lomer–Cottrell barriers,
and (3) jogs produced either by moving dislocationscutting through forest dislocations or by forest dis-
locations cutting through source dislocations. Conse-
quently, the ﬂow stress /FSmay be identiﬁed, in general
terms, with a stress which is sufﬁcient to operate asource and then move the dislocations against (1) the
internal elastic stresses from the forest dislocations,
(2) the long-range stresses from groups of dislocationspiled up behind barriers, and (3) the frictional resis-
tance due to jogs. In a cold-worked metal all these
factors may exist to some extent, but because a linear
hardening law can be derived by using any one of the
various contributory factors, there have been severaltheories of Stage II-hardening, namely (1) the pileup
theory, (2) the forest theory and (3) the jog theory.
All have been shown to have limitations in explaining
various features of the deformation process, and have
given way to a more phenomenological theory basedon direct observations of the dislocation distribution
during straining.
Observations on fcc and bcc crystals have revealed
several common features of the microstructure which
includetheformationofdipoles,tanglesandcellstruc-tures with increasing strain. The most detailed obser-
vations have been made for copper crystals, and these
are summarized below to illustrate the general pattern
of behaviour. In Stage I, bands of dipoles are formed
(see Figure 7.41a) elongated normal to the primaryBurgers vector direction. Their formation is associated
with isolated forest dislocations and individual dipoles
are about 1
µm in length and /H1135410 nm wide. Differ-
ent patches are arranged at spacings of about 10 µm
along the line of intersection of a secondary slip plane.With increasing strain in Stage I the size of the gaps
between the dipole clusters decreases and therefore the
stress required to push dislocations through these gaps
increases. Stage II begins (see Figure 7.41b) when
the applied stress plus internal stress resolved on thesecondary systems is sufﬁcient to activate secondary
sources near the dipole clusters. The resulting local
secondary slip leads to local interactions between pri-
mary and secondary dislocations both in the gaps and
in the clusters of dipoles, the gaps being ﬁlled withsecondary dislocations and short lengths of other dis-
locations formed by interactions (e.g. Lomer–Cottrell
dislocations in fcc crystals and ah100itype dislo-
cations in bcc crystals). Dislocation barriers are thus
formed surrounding the original sources.
In Stage II (see Figure 7.41c) it is proposed that
dislocations are stopped by elastic interaction when
they pass too close to an existing tangled region
with high dislocation density. The long-range internal
stresses due to the dislocations piling up behind arepartially relieved by secondary slip, which transforms
the discrete pile-up into a region of high dislocation
density containing secondary dislocation networks and
dipoles. These regions of high dislocation density act
as new obstacles to dislocation glide, and since everynew obstacle is formed near one produced at a lower
strain, two-dimensional dislocation structures are built
upformingthewallsofanirregularcellstructure.With
increasing strain the number of obstacles increases, the
distance a dislocation glides decreases and thereforethe slip line length decreases in Stage II. The structure
remains similar throughout Stage II but is reduced in
scale. The obstacles are in the form of ribbons of high
densities of dislocations which, like pile-ups, tend to
form sheets. The work-hardening rate depends mainly

SF. In Stage I dislocation multipoles
are formed as a result of dislocations of opposite sign
on parallel nearby slip planes ‘pairing up ’with one
230Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
another. Most of these dislocations are primaries. In
Stage II the density of secondary dislocations is much
less (³1
3) than that of the primary dislocations. The
secondary slip occurs in bands and in each band slip
on one particular secondary plane predominates. Inniobium, a metal with high /CR
SF, the dislocation dis-
tribution is rather similar to copper. In Mg, typical of
cph metals, Stage I is extensive and the dislocationsare mainly in the form of primary edge multipoles,but forest dislocations threading the primary slip planedo not appear to be generated.
From the curve shown in Figure 7.40 it is evident
that the rate of work-hardening decreases in the later
stages of the test. This observation indicates that atas u fﬁciently high stress or temperature the disloca-
tions held up in Stage II are able to move by a processwhich at lower stresses and temperature had been sup-pressed. The onset of Stage III is accompanied by
cross-slip, and the slip lines are broad, deep and con-
sist of segments joined by cross-slip traces. Electronmetallographic observations on sections of deformedcrystal inclined to the slip plane (see Figure 7.41d)show the formation of a cell structure in the formof boundaries, approximately parallel to the primaryslip plane of spacing about 1 –3
µm plus other bound-
aries extending normal to the slip plane as a result of
cross-slip.
The simplest process which is in agreement with
theexperimentalobservationsisthatthescrewdisloca-tions held up in Stage II, cross-slip and possibly returnto the primary slip plane by double cross-slip. By this
mechanism, dislocations can bypass the obstacles in
their glide plane and do not have to interact stronglywith them. Such behaviour leads to an increase in slipdistance and a decrease in the accompanying rate ofwork-hardening. Furthermore, it is to be expected thatscrew dislocations leaving the glide plane by cross-
slip may also meet dislocations on parallel planes and
be attracted by those of opposite sign. Annihilationthen takes place and the annihilated dislocation willbe replaced, partly at least, from the original source.This process if repeated can lead to slip-band forma-tion, which is also an important experimental feature
of Stage III. Hardening in Stage III is then due to the
edge parts of the loops which remain in the crystal andincrease in density as the source continues to operate.
The importance of the value of the stacking fault
energy, /CR, on the stress –strain curve is evident from
its importance to the process of cross-slip. Low values
of/CRgive rise to wide stacking fault ‘ribbons’,a n d
consequently cross-slip is dif ﬁcult at reasonable stress
levels. Thus, the screws cannot escape from theirslip plane, the slip distance is small, the dislocationdensity is high and the transition from Stage II toStage III is delayed. In aluminium the stacking fault
ribbon width is very small because /CRhas a high value,
and cross-slip occurs at room temperature. Stage II is,therefore, poorly developed unless testing is carriedout at low temperatures. These conclusions are inagreement with the observations of dislocation density
and arrangement.
7.6.2.3 Work-hardening in polycrystals
The dislocation structure developed during the defor-
mation of fcc and bcc polycrystalline metals followsthe same general pattern as that in single crystals;
primary dislocations produce dipoles and loops by
interaction with secondary dislocations, which giverise to local dislocation tangles gradually develop-ingintothree-dimensionalnetworksofsub-boundaries.
The cell size decreases with increasing strain, and the
structural differences that are observed between var-ious metals and alloys are mainly in the sharpness
of the sub-boundaries. In bcc metals, and fcc metals
with high stacking-fault energy, the tangles rearrangeinto sharp boundaries but in metals of low stackingfault energy the dislocations are extended, cross-slip is
restricted, and sharp boundaries are not formed even at
largestrains.Alteringthedeformationtemperaturealsohas the effect of changing the dislocation distribution;
lowering the deformation temperature reduces the ten-
dency for cell formation, as shown in Figure 7.42. Fora given dislocation distribution the dislocation density
is simply related to the ﬂow stress /FSby an equation of
the form
/FSD/FS
0C˛/SYNb/SUB1/2(7.27)
where ˛is a constant at a given temperature ³0.5;
/FS0for fcc metals is zero (see Figure 7.38). The
workhardening rate is determined by the ease withwhich tangled dislocations rearrange themselves andis high in materials with low /CR, i.e. brasses, bronzes
and austenitic steels compared to Al and bcc met-
als. In some austenitic steels, work-hardening maybe increased and better sustained by a strain-induced
phase transformation (see Chapter 8).

temperature on the formation of a cell structure in ˛-iron.
Mechanical behaviour of materials 231
Grainboundariesaffect work-hardeningbyactingas
barriers to slip from one grain to the next. In addition,
the continuity criterion of polycrystals enforces com-
plexslipintheneighbourhoodoftheboundarieswhich
spreads across the grains with increasing deformation.This introduces a dependence of work-hardening rate
on grain size which extends to several per cent elonga-
tion.Afterthisstage,however,thework-hardeningrate
is independent of grain size and for fcc polycrystals is
about/SYN/40,which,allowingfortheorientationfactors,
is roughly comparable with that found in single crys-
tals deforming in multiple slip. Thus from the relations/ESCDm/FSandεD/CR/mthe average resolved shear stress
onaslipplaneisratherlessthanhalftheappliedtensile
stress, and the average shear strain parallel to the slip
plane is rather more than twice the tensile elongation.
The polycrystal work-hardening rate is thus related tothe single-crystal work-hardening rate by the relation
d/ESC/dεDm
2d/FS/d/CR (7.28)
For bcc metals with the multiplicity of slip systems
and the ease of cross-slip mis more nearly 2, so that
the work-hardening rate is low. In polycrystalline cph
metals the deformation is complicated by twinning,
but in the absence of twinning m³6.5, and hence the
work-hardening rate is expected to be more than anorder of magnitude greater than for single crystals, and
also higher than the rate observed in fcc polycrystals
for whichm³3.
7.6.2.4 Dispersion-hardened alloys
On deforming an alloy containing incoherent, non-
deformable particles the rate of work-hardening is
much greater than that shown by the matrix alone
(see Figure 8.10). The dislocation density increases
very rapidly with strain because the particles producea turbulent and complex deformation pattern around
them. The dislocations gliding in the matrix leave
loops around particles either by bowing between the
particles or by cross-slipping around them; both these
mechanismsarediscussedinChapter 8.Thestressesinandaroundparticlesmay alsoberelievedby activating
secondary slip systems in the matrix. All these dislo-
cations spread out from the particle as strain proceeds
and, by intersecting the primary glide plane, hinder
primary dislocation motion and lead to intense work-hardening. A dense tangle of dislocations is built up
at the particle and a cell structure is formed with the
particles predominantly in the cell walls.
At small strains ⊿
/lessorsimilar1%/triangleleftwork-hardening probably
arises from the back-stress exerted by the few Orowanloopsaround the particles, as described by Fisher, Hart
and Pry. The stress–strain curve is reasonably linear

7.6.2.5 Work-hardening in ordered alloys
A characteristic feature of alloyswithlong-rangeorderis that they work-harden more rapidly than in thedisordered state. /DC2
11for Fe-Al with a B2 ordered
structure is ³/SYN/50 at room temperature, several times
greater than a typical fcc or bcc metal. However,the density of secondary dislocations in Stage II isrelatively low and only about 1/100 of that of the
primary dislocations. One mechanism for the increase
in work-hardening rate is thought to arise from thegeneration of antiphase domain boundary (apb) tubes.A possible geometry is shown in Figure 7.43a; thesuperdislocation partials shown each contain a jogproduced, for example, by intersection with a forestdislocation, which are nonaligned along the direction
of the Burgers vector. When the dislocation glides
and the jogs move nonconservatively a tube of apbsis generated. Direct evidence for the existence oftubes from weak-beam electron microscope studieswas ﬁrst reported for Fe-30 at.% Al. The micrographsshow faint lines along h111i, the Burgers vector
direction, and are about 3 nm in width. The images
are expected to be weak, since the contrast arises
from two closely spaced overlappingfaults, the secondeffectively cancelling the displacement caused by theﬁrst, and are visible only when superlattice reﬂections

are excited. APB tubes have since been observed in
other compounds.
Theory suggests that jogs in superdislocations in
screw orientations provide a potent hardening mecha-nism,estimatedtobeabouteighttimesasstrongasthatresulting from pulling out of apb tubes on non-aligned
jogs on edge dislocations. The major contributions to
the stress to move a dislocation are (1) /FS

In crystals with A 3B order only one rapid stage
of hardening is observed compared with the normalthree-stage hardening of fcc metals. Moreover, the
temperature-dependence of /DC2

perature and peaks at ¾0.4Tm. It has been argued
that the apb tube model is unable to explain whyanomalously high work-hardening rates are observedfor those single crystal orientations favourable for sin-gle slip on f111gplanes alone. An alternative model
to apb tubes has been proposed based on cross-slip of
the leading unit dislocation of the superdislocation. Ifthe second unit dislocation cannot follow exactly inthe wake of the ﬁrst, both will be pinned.
For alloys with L1

screw superpartial with bD1

⊿111/triangleleftplane to the⊿010/triangleleftplane was ﬁrst proposed by
Kear and Wilsdorf. The two1
2[101] superpartials, one
on the⊿111/triangleleftplane and the other on the ⊿010/triangleleftplane,
are of course dissociated into h112i-type partials and
the whole conﬁguration is sessile. This dislocationarrangement is known as a Kear–Wilsdorf (K–W)lock and is shown in Figure 7.43b. Since cross-slipis thermally activated, the number of locks and there-
fore the resistance to ⊿111/triangleleftglide will increase withincreasing temperature. This could account for the
increase in yield stress with temperature, while the
onset of cube slip at elevated temperatures could
account for the peak in the ﬂow stress.

7.6.3 Development of preferred orientation
7.6.3.1 Crystallographic aspects
When a polycrystalline metal is plastically deformed
the individual grains tend to rotate into a commonorientation. This preferred orientation is developed
gradually with increasing deformation, and although
it becomes extensive above about 90% reduction inarea, it is still inferior to that of a good single crystal.Thedegreeoftextureproducedbyagivendeformationis readily shown on a monochromatic X-ray transmis-sion photograph, since the grains no longer reﬂect uni-formly into the diffraction rings but only into certainsegments of them. The results are usually described interms of an ideal orientation, such as [ u,
v,w]f o rt h e
ﬁbre texture developed by drawing or swaging, and
fhklghuvwifor a rolling texture for which a plane of
the form ( hkl) lies parallel to the rolling plane and a
direction of the type huvwiis parallel to the rolling
direction. However, the scatter about the ideal orienta-tion can only be represented by means of a pole-ﬁgurewhich describes the spread of orientation about theideal orientation for a particular set of ( hkl) poles (see
Figure 7.44).
Mechanical behaviour of materials 233
Figure 7.44 ( 111)p o l e ﬁgures from (a) copper, and (b) ˛-brass after 95% deformation (intensities in arbitrary units) .
In tension, the grains rotate in such a way that the
movement of the applied stress axis is towards the
operative slip direction as discussed in Section 7.3.5
and for compression the applied stress moves towardsthe slip plane normal. By considering the deformationprocessintermsoftheparticularstressesoperatingand
applyingtheappropriategrainrotationsitispossibleto
predict the stable end-grain orientation and hence thetexture developed by extensive deformation. Table 7.3shows the predominant textures found in different
metal structures for both wires and sheet.
For fcc metals a marked transition in deformation
texture can be effected either by lowering the defor-mation temperature or by adding solid solution alloy-
ing elements which lower the stacking fault energy.
The transition relates to the effect on deformationmodes of reducing stacking fault energy or thermalenergy, deformation banding and twinning becoming
more prevalent and cross-slip less important at lower
temperatures and stacking fault energies. This texturetransition can be achieved in most fcc metals by alloy-ing additions and by altering the rolling temperature.
Al, however, has a high fault energy and because of
the limited solid solubility it is difﬁcult to lower byalloying. The extreme types of rolling texture, shownby copper and 70/30 brass, are given in Figures 7.44a
and 7.44b.
In bcc metals there are no striking examples of
solid solution alloying effects on deformation texture,the preferred orientation developed being remarkably
insensitive to material variables. However, material
variables can affect cph textures markedly. Variationsinc/aratio alone cause alterations in the orientationdeveloped, as may be appreciated by consideration
of the twinning modes, and it is also possible that
solid solution elements alter the relative values ofcritical resolved shear stress for different deformationmodes. Processing variables are also capable of giving
a degree of control in hexagonal metals. No texture,
stable to further deformation, is found in hexagonalmetals and the angle of inclination of the basal planes
to the sheet plane varies continuously with deforma-
tion. In general, the basal plane lies at a small angle⊿<45
°/triangleleftto the rolling plane, tilted either towards the
rolling direction (Zn, Mg) or towards the transverse
direction (Ti, Zr, Be, Hf).
The deformation texture cannot, in general, be elim-
inated by an annealing operation even when such a
treatment causes recrystallization. Instead, the forma-
tion of a new annealing texture usually results, whichis related to the deformation texture by standard lattice
rotations.
7.6.3.2 Texture-hardening
The ﬂow stress in single crystals varies with orienta-
tion according to Schmid’s law and hence materialswith a preferred orientation will also show similar
plastic anisotropy, depending on the perfection of the
texture. The signiﬁcance of this relationship is wellillustrated by a crystal of beryllium which is cph and
capable of slip only on the basal plane, a compres-
sive stress approaching ³2000 MN/m
2applied normal
to the basal plane produces negligible plastic defor-
mation. Polycrystalline beryllium sheet, with a texturesuch that the basal planes lie in the plane of the sheet,

shows a correspondingly high strength in biaxial ten-
sion. When stretched uniaxially the ﬂow stress is also
quite high, when additional (prismatic) slip planes areforced intoactioneven thoughthe shear stressfor theiroperation is ﬁve times greater than for basal slip. Dur-ing deformation there is little thinning of the sheet,
because the h11
20idirections are aligned in the plane
of the sheet. Other hexagonal metals, such as tita-nium and zirconium, show less marked strengtheningin uniaxial tension because prismatic slip occurs morereadily, but resistance to biaxial tension can still beachieved. Applications of texture-hardening lie in theuse of suitably textured sheet for high biaxial strength,e.g. pressure vessels, dent resistance, etc. Because ofthe multiplicity of slip systems, cubic metals offer
much less scope for texture-hardening. Again, a con-
sideration of single crystal deformation gives the clue;for whereas in a hexagonal crystal mcan vary from 2
(basal planes at 45
°to the stress axis) to inﬁnity (when
the basal planes are normal), in an fcc crystal mcan
vary only by a factor of 2 with orientation, and in bcccrystals the variation is rather less. In extending thisapproach to polycrystalline material certain assump-tions have to be made about the mutual constraintsbetween grains. One approach gives mD3.1f o ra
random aggregate of fcc crystals and the calculated
orientation dependence of /ESC//FSfor ﬁbre texture shows
that a rod with h111iorh110itexture⊿/ESC//FSD3.664/triangleleft
is 20% stronger than a random structure; the cube tex-ture⊿/ESC//FSD2.449/triangleleftis 20% weaker.
If conventional mechanical properties were the sole
criterion for texture-hardened materials, then it seemsunlikelythattheywouldchallengestrongprecipitation-hardened alloys. However, texture-hardening has moresubtle beneﬁts in sheet metal forming in optimizing
fabrication performance. The variation of strength in
the plane of the sheet is readily assessed by tensiletests carried out in various directions relative to therolling direction. In many sheet applications, however,the requirement is for through-thickness strength (e.g.to resist thinning during pressing operations). This ismore difﬁcult to measure and is often assessed fromuniaxial tensile tests by measuring the ratio of thestrain in the width direction to that in the thicknessdirection of a test piece. The strain ratio Ris given by

high through-thickness strength.
In deep-drawing, schematically illustrated in
Figure 7.45, the dominant stress system is radialtension combined with circumferential compression inthe drawing zone, while that in the base and lowercup wall (i.e. central stretch-forming zone) is biaxialtension. The latter stress is equivalent to a through-thickness compression, plus a hydrostatic tensionwhich does not affect the state of yielding. Drawing

is insufﬁciently strong to support the load needed todraw the outer part of the blank through the die.Clearlydifferentialstrengthlevelsinthesetworegions,leading to greater ease of deformation in the drawingzone compared with the stretching zone, would enabledeeperdrawstobemade:thisistheeffectofincreasing

Face-centred cubic metals have Rranging from about
0.3 for cube-texture, f100gh001i, to a maximum,
in textures so far attained, of just over 1.0. Highervalues are sometimes obtained in body-centred cubic
metals. Values of
Rin the range 1 .4¾1.8 obtained
in aluminium-killed low-carbon steel are associatedwith signiﬁcant improvements in deep-drawing per-
formance compared with rimming steel, which has
R-values between 1.0 and 1.4. The highest values of
Rin steels are associated with texture components
withf111gparallel to the surface, while crystals with
f100gparallel to the surface have a strongly depress-
ing effect on R.
In most cases it is found that the Rvalues vary
with testing direction and this has relevance in rela-tionto the strain distributionin sheet metal forming. In
particular, ear formation on pressings generally devel-
ops under a predominant uniaxial compressive stressat the edge of the pressing. The ear is a direct con-sequence of the variation in strain ratio for differentdirections of uniaxial stressing, and a large variation
inRvalue, where RD⊿R

7.7 Macroscopic plasticity
7.7.1 Tresca and von Mises criteria
In dislocation theory it is usual to consider the ﬂowstress or yield stress of ductile metals under simpleconditions of stressing. In practice, the engineer dealswith metals under more complex conditions of stress-ing(e.g.duringformingoperations)andhenceneedstocorrelate yielding under combined stresses with that in
uniaxialtesting.Toachievesuchayieldstresscriterion
it is usually assumed that the metal is mechanicallyisotropic and deforms plastically at constant volume,i.e. a hydrostatic state of stress does not affect yield-ing. In assuming plastic isotropy, macroscopic shear isallowed to take place along lines of maximum shear
stressandcrystallographicslipisignored,andtheyield
stress in tension is equal to that in compression, i.e.there is no Bauschinger effect.
A given applied stress state in terms of the princi-
pal stresses/ESC
1,/ESC2,/ESC3which act along three principal
axes,X1,X2andX3, may be separated into the hydro-
static part (which produces changes in volume) and
the deviatoric components (which produce changes inshape). It is assumed that the hydrostatic componenthas no effect on yielding and hence the more the stressstate deviates from pure hydrostatic, the greater thetendency to produce yield. The stresses may be rep-resented on a stress–space plot (see Figure 7.47a), in
which a line equidistant from the three stress axes rep-
resents a pure hydrostatic stress state. Deviation fromthis line will cause yielding if the deviation is suf-ﬁciently large, and deﬁne a yield surface which hassixfoldsymmetryaboutthehydrostaticline.Thisarisesbecause the conditions of isotropy imply equal yield
stresses along all three axes, and the absence of the
Bauschinger effect implies equal yield stresses along/ESC
1and/NUL/ESC1. Taking a section through stress space,
perpendicular to the hydrostatic line gives the twosimplest yield criteria satisfying the symmetry require-ments corresponding to a regular hexagon and a circle.
The hexagonal form represents the Tresca criterion
(see Figure 7.47c) which assumes that plastic shear
takes place when the maximum shear stress attains acritical value kequal to shear yield stress in uniaxial
tension. This is expressed by

a critical value given by the constant. This constant

In many practical working processes (e.g. rolling),
the deformation occurs under approximately plane
strain conditions with displacements conﬁned to the
X1X2plane. It does not follow that the stress in this
direction is zero, and, in fact, the deformation condi-
tions are satisﬁed if /ESC3D1

7.7.2 Effective stress and strain
For an isotropic material, a knowledge of the uniaxial
tensile test behaviour together with the yield func-
tion should enable the stress–strain behaviour to be
predicted for any stress system. This is achieved bydeﬁning an effective stress–effective strain relation-
ship such that if /ESCDKε

relationship then we may write.
/ESCDKεn(7.35)
for any state of stress. The stress–strain behaviour of
a thin-walled tube with internal pressure is a typi-cal example, and it is observed that the ﬂow curves
obtained in uniaxial tension and in biaxial torsion
coincide when the curves are plotted in terms of effec-tive stress and effective strain. These quantities aredeﬁned by:

7.8 Annealing
7.8.1 General effects of annealing
When a metal is cold-worked, by any of the many
industrial shaping operations, changes occur in both
its physical and mechanical properties. While the
increased hardness and strength which result from theworking treatment may be of importance in certainapplications, it is frequently necessary to return themetal to its original condition to allow further formingoperations (e.g. deep drawing) to be carried out of forapplications where optimum physical properties, such
as electrical conductivity, are essential. The treatment
given to the metal to bring about a decrease of thehardness and an increase in the ductility is known asannealing. This usually means keeping the deformedmetal for a certain time at a temperature higher thanabout one-third the absolute melting point.
Cold working produces an increase in dislocation
density; for most metals /SUBincreases from the value
of 10
10–1012lines m/NUL2typical of the annealed state,
to 1012–1013after a few per cent deformation, and
up to 1015–1016lines m/NUL2in the heavily deformed
state. Such an array of dislocations gives rise to asubstantialstrainenergystoredinthelattice,sothatthecold-worked condition is thermodynamically unstablerelative to the undeformed one. Consequently, thedeformed metal will try to return to a state of lowerfree energy, i.e. a more perfect state. In general, this
return to a more equilibrium structure cannot occur
spontaneously but only at elevated temperatures wherethermally activated processes such as diffusion, cross-slip and climb take place. Like all non-equilibriumprocesses the rate of approach to equilibrium will begoverned by an Arrhenius equation of the form
RateDAexp[/NULQ/kT]
where the activation energy Qdepends on impurity
content, strain, etc.
The formation of atmospheres by strain-ageing is
one method whereby the metal reduces its excess
lattice energy but this process is unique in that it
usually leads to a further increase in the structure-sensitive properties rather than a reduction to the valuecharacteristicoftheannealedcondition.Itisnecessary,therefore, to increase the temperature of the deformed
metal above the strain-ageing temperature before it
recovers its original softness and other properties.
The removal of the cold-worked condition occurs
by a combination of three processes, namely:(1) recovery,(2) recrystallizationand(3) graingrowth.These stages have been successfully studied usinglightmicroscopy, transmissionelectron microscopy, orX-ray diffraction; mechanical property measurements(e.g. hardness); and physical property measurements(e.g. density, electrical resistivity and stored energy).
Figure 7.49 shows the change in some of these prop-
erties on annealing. During the recovery stage thedecrease in stored energy and electrical resistivityis accompanied by only a slight lowering of hard-ness, and the greatest simultaneous change in proper-ties occurs during the primary recrystallization stage.However, while these measurements are no doubtstriking and extremely useful, it is necessary to under-stand them to correlate such studies with the structuralchanges by which they are accompanied.
7.8.2 Recovery
This process describes the changes in the distribution
anddensityofdefectswithassociatedchangesinphys-
ical and mechanical properties which take place inworked crystals before recrystallization or alterationof orientation occurs. It will be remembered that thestructure of a cold-worked metal consists of dense dis-location networks, formed by the glide and interactionof dislocations, and, consequently, the recovery stageof annealing is chieﬂy concerned with the rearrange-ment of these dislocations to reduce the lattice energyand does not involve the migration of large-angle
boundaries. This rearrangement of the dislocations is

increment in electrical resistivity ⊿/SUB/triangleleftand hardness (VPN)
for specimens of nickel deformed in torsion and heated at 6
k/min (Clareborough, Hargreaves and West, 1955) .
238Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
assisted by thermal activation. Mutual annihilation of
dislocations is one process.
When the two dislocations are on the same slip
plane, it is possible that as they run together and
annihilate they will have to cut through intersecting
dislocations on other planes, i.e. ‘forest’ dislocations.This recovery process will, therefore, be aided by ther-mal ﬂuctuations since the activation energy for such a
cutting process is small. When the two dislocations of
opposite sign are not on the same slip plane, climb orcross-slip must ﬁrst occur, and both processes require
thermal activation.
Oneofthemostimportantrecovery processeswhich
leads to a resultant lowering of the lattice strainenergy is rearrangement of the dislocations into cell
walls. This process in its simplest form was originally
termed polygonization and is illustrated schematicallyin Figure 7.50, whereby dislocations all of one sign
alignthemselvesintowallstoform small-angleor sub-
grain boundaries. During deformation a region of thelattice is curved, as shown in Figure 7.50a, and theobserved curvature can be attributed to the formation
ofexcessedgedislocationsparalleltotheaxisofbend-
ing. On heating, the dislocations form a sub-boundaryby a process of annihilationand rearrangement. This is
shown in Figure 7.50b, from which it can be seen that
it is the excess dislocations of one sign which remainaftertheannihilationprocessthatalignthemselvesintowalls.
Polygonization is a simple form of sub-boundary
formation and the basic movement is climb wherebythe edge dislocations change their arrangement from ahorizontaltoa verticalgrouping.Thisprocessinvolves
the migration of vacancies to or from the edge of the
half-planes of the dislocations (see Section 4.3.4). Theremovalofvacanciesfromthelattice,togetherwiththe
reducedstrainenergyofdislocationswhichresults,can
account for the large change in both electrical resis-tivity and stored energy observed during this stage,
while the change in hardness can be attributed to the
rearrangement of dislocations and to the reduction inthe density of dislocations.
The process of polygonization can be demonstrated
using the Laue method of X-ray diffraction. Diffrac-tion from a bent single crystal of zinc takes the form
of continuous radial streaks. On annealing, these aster-
isms (see Figure 5.10) break up into spots as shownin Figure 7.50c, where each diffraction spot originates
from a perfect polygonized sub-grain, and the distance
between the spots represents the angular misorienta-tion across the sub-grain boundary. Direct evidence
for this process is observed in the electron microscope,
where, in heavily deformed polycrystalline aggregatesat least, recovery is associated with the formation of
sub-grains out of complex dislocation networks by
a process of dislocation annihilation and rearrange-ment. In some deformed metals and alloys the disloca-
tions are already partially arranged in sub-boundaries
forming diffuse cell structures by dynamical recovery(see Figure 7.41). The conventional recovery processis then one in which these cells sharpen and grow.
In other metals, dislocations are more uniformly dis-
tributed after deformation, with hardly any cell struc-turediscernible,andtherecoveryprocesstheninvolves
formation, sharpening and growth of sub-boundaries.
The sharpness of the cell structure formed by defor-mation depends on the stacking fault energy of the
metal, the deformation temperature and the extent of

7.8.3 Recrystallization
The most signiﬁcant changes in the structure-sensitive
properties occur during the primary recrystallizationstage. In this stage the deformed lattice is completelyreplaced by a new unstrained one by means of a nucle-
ation and growth process, in which practically stress-
free grains grow from nuclei formed in the deformedmatrix. The orientation of the new grains differs con-siderably from that of the crystals they consume, so
thatthegrowthprocessmustberegardedasincoherent,
i.e. it takes place by the advance of large-angle bound-aries separating the new crystals from the strained
matrix.
During the growth of grains, atoms get transferred
from one grain to another across the boundary. Such aprocess isthermally activatedas shownin Figure 7.51,

Generally, the open structure of high-angle bound-
aries should lead to a high mobility. However they are

centrations of which can reduce the boundary mobilityby orders of magnitude. In contrast, special bound-aries which are close to a CSL are much less affectedby impurity segregation and hence can lead to higherrelative mobility.
It is well known that the rate of recrystallization
depends on several important factors, namely: (1) theamount of prior deformation (the greater the degreeof cold work, the lower the recrystallization tempera-ture and the smaller the grain size), (2) the tempera-ture of the anneal (as the temperature is lowered thetime to attain a constant grain size increases exponen-
tially
1) and (3) the purity of the sample (e.g. zone-
reﬁned aluminium recrystallizes below room tempera-ture, whereas aluminium of commercial puritymust beheated several hundred degrees). The role these vari-ables play in recrystallization will be evident once themechanism of recrystallization is known. This mecha-
nism will now be outlined.
Measurements, using the light microscope, of the
increase in diameter of a new grain as a function oftime at any given temperature can be expressed asshown in Figure 7.52. The diameter increases linearlywith time until the growing grains begin to impinge onone another, after which the rate necessarily decreases.The classical interpretation of these observations isthat nuclei form spontaneously in the matrix after aso-called nucleation time, t
0, and these nuclei then
proceed to grow steadily as shown by the linear rela-tionship. The driving force for the process is providedby the stored energy of cold work contained in thestrained grain on one side of the boundary relative tothat on the other side. Such an interpretation wouldsuggest that the recrystallization process occurs in twodistinct stages, i.e. ﬁrst nucleation and then growth.

An alternative interpretation is that the so-called
incubation time t0represents a period during which
small nuclei, of a size too small to be observed in thelight microscope, are growing very slowly. This lat-
ter interpretation follows from the recovery stage of
annealing. Thus, the structure of a recovered metalconsists of sub-grain regions of practically perfectcrystal and, thus, one might expect the ‘active’ recrys-
tallization nuclei to be formed by the growth of certain
sub-grains at the expense of others.
The process of recrystallization may be pictured as
follows. After deformation, polygonization of the bent
lattice regions on a ﬁne scale occurs and this results in
theformationofseveralregionsinthelatticewherethestrain energy is lower than in the surrounding matrix;this is a necessary primary condition for nucleation.
During this initial period when the angles between
the sub-grains are small and less than one degree,the sub-grains form and grow quite rapidly. However,as the sub-grains grow to such a size that the anglesbetween them become of the order of a few degrees,
thegrowthofanygivensub-grainattheexpenseof the
others is very slow. Eventually one of the sub-grainswill grow to such a size that the boundary mobility
begins to increase with increasing angle. A large angle
boundary,/DC2³30–40
°, has a high mobility because
of the large lattice irregularities or ‘gaps’ which existin the boundary transition layer. The atoms on such
a boundary can easily transfer their allegiance from
one crystal to the other. This sub-grain is then ableto grow at a much faster rate than the other sub-grains which surround it and so acts as the nucleus
of a recrystallized grain. The further it grows, the
greater will be the difference in orientation betweenthenucleusandthematrixitmeetsandconsumes,untilit ﬁnally becomes recognizable as a new strain-free
crystalseparatedfromitssurroundingsbyalarge-angle
boundary.
The recrystallization nucleus therefore has its origin
asasub-graininthedeformedmicrostructure.Whether
it growstobecome a strain-free grain dependsonthree
factors: (1) the stored energy of cold work must besufﬁciently high to provide the required driving force,(2) the potential nucleus should have a size advantage
over its neighbours, and (3) it must be capable of con-
tinued growth by existing in a region of high latticecurvature (e.g. transition band) so that the growingnucleus can quickly achieve a high-angle boundary. In
situexperiments in the HVEM have conﬁrmed these
factors. Figure 7.53a shows the as-deformed substruc-ture in the transverse section of rolled copper, togetherwith the orientations of some selected areas. The sub-
grains are observed to vary in width from 50 to 500
nm, and exist between regions 1 and 8 as a transitionband across which the orientation changes sharply. Onheatingto 200
°C, thesub-grainregion 2 growsintothe
transition region (Figure 7.53b) and the orientation of
the new grain well developed at 300 °C is identical to
the original sub-grain (Figure 7.53c).
With this knowledge of recrystallization the inﬂu-
ence of several variables known to affect the recrys-
tallization behaviour of a metal can now be under-stood. Prior deformation, for example, will control theextent to which a region of the lattice is curved. The
larger the deformation, the more severely will the lat-
tice be curved and, consequently, the smaller will bethe size of a growing sub-grain when it acquires alarge-angle boundary. This must mean that a shorter
time is necessary at any given temperature for the sub-
grain to become an ‘active’ nucleus, or conversely,that the higher the annealing temperature, the quicker
will this stage be reached. In some instances, heavily
cold-worked metals recrystallize without any signif-icant recovery owing to the formation of strain-freecells during deformation. The importance of impurity
content on recrystallization temperature is also evident
from the effect impurities have on obstructing disloca-tion sub-boundary and grain boundary mobility.
The intragranular nucleation of strain-free grains,
as discussed above, is considered as abnormal sub-
grain growth, in which it is necessary to specifythat some sub-grains acquire a size advantage and

are able to grow at the expense of the normal sub-
grains. It has been suggested that nuclei may also
be formed by a process involving the rotation of
individualcellssothattheycoalescewithneighbouring
cells to produce larger cells by volume diffusion and
dislocation rearrangement.
In some circumstances, intergranular nucleation is
observed in which an existing grain boundary bows
outunderaninitialdrivingforceequaltothedifference
in free energy across the grain boundary. This strain-
induced boundary migration is irregular and is froma grain with low strain (i.e. large cell size) to one
of larger strain and smaller cell size. For a boundary
to grow in this way the strain energy difference per
unit volume across the boundary must be sufﬁcient
to supply the energy increase to bow out a length ofboundary ³1
µm.Segregation of solute atoms to, and precipitation
on, the grain boundary tends to inhibit intergranu-
lar nucleation and gives an advantage to intragran-
ular nucleation, provided the dispersion is not too
ﬁne. In general, the recrystallization behaviour of two-
phase alloys is extremely sensitive to the dispersionof the second phase. Small, ﬁnely dispersed particles
retard recrystallization by reducing both the nucleation
rate and the grain boundary mobility, whereas large
coarsely dispersed particles enhance recrystallization
by increasing the nucleation rate. During deformation,zones of high dislocation density and large misorien-
tations are formed around non-deformable particles,
and on annealing, recrystallization nuclei are created
within these zones by a process of polygonization by
sub-boundarymigration.Particle-stimulatednucleationoccurs above a critical particle size which decreases

7.8.4 Grain growth
When primary recrystallization is complete (i.e. when
the growing crystals have consumed all the strained
material) the material can lower its energy further by
reducing its total area of grain surface. With exten-
sive annealing it is often found that grain boundaries
straighten, small grains shrink and larger ones grow.
The general phenomenon is known as grain growth,
and the most important factor governing the process is
the surface tension of the grain boundaries. A grain
boundary has a surface tension, T(Dsurface-free
energy per unit area) because its atoms have a higher
free energythanthosewithinthegrains.Consequently,
to reduce this energy a polycrystal will tend to min-
imize the area of its grain boundaries and when this
occurs the conﬁguration taken up by any set of grain
boundaries (see Figure 7.54) will be governed by the
condition that
TA/sinADTB/sinBDTC/sinC (7.45)
Most grain boundaries are of the large-angle type
with their energies approximately independent of ori-
entation, so that for a random aggregate of grains
TADTBDTCand the equilibrium grain boundary
angles are each equal to 120 °. Figure 7.54b shows an
idealizedgrainintwodimensionssurroundedbyothers
Figure 7.54 (a) Relation between angles and surface
tensions at a grain boundary triple point; (b) idealized
polygonal grain structure .of uniform size, and it can be seen that the equilibrium
grain shape takes the form of a polygon of six sideswith 120
°inclusive angles. All polygons with either
more or less than this number of sides cannot be in
equilibrium. At high temperatures where the atoms aremobile, a grain with fewer sides will tend to become
smaller, under the action of the grain boundary surface
tension forces, while one with more sides will tend to
grow.
Second-phase particles have a major inhibiting
effect on boundary migration and are particularly
effective in the control of grain size. The pinning
process arises from surface tension forces exerted bythe particle–matrix interface on the grain boundary as
it migrates past the particle. Figure 7.55 shows that the
drag exerted by the particle on the boundary, resolved
in the forward direction, is

(7.48)
where Zis the ratio of the diameters of growing grains

During the above process growth is continuous and
a uniform coarsening of the polycrystalline aggregate
usually occurs. Nevertheless, even after growth has
ﬁ n i s h e dt h eg r a i ns i z ei nas p e c i m e nw h i c hw a spreviously severely cold-worked remains relativelysmall, because of the large number of nuclei producedby the working treatment. Exaggerated grain growthcan often be induced, however, in one of twoways, namely: (1) by subjecting the specimen to a
critical strain-anneal treatment or (2) by a process
of secondary recrystallization. By applying a criticaldeformation (usually a few per cent strain) to thespecimen the number of nuclei will be kept toa minimum, and if this strain is followed by ahigh-temperature anneal in a thermal gradient someof these nuclei will be made more favourable for
rapid growth than others. With this technique, if the
conditions are carefully controlled, the whole of thespecimen may be turned into one crystal, i.e. a singlecrystal. The term secondary recrystallization describesthe process whereby a specimen which has beengiven a primary recrystallization treatment at a low
temperature is taken to a higher temperature to enable
the abnormally rapid growth of a few grains to occur.The only driving force for secondary recrystallizationis the reduction of grain boundary-free energy, asin normal grain growth, and consequently, certainspecial conditions are necessary for its occurrence.One condition for this ‘abnormal’ growth is that
normal continuous growth is impeded by the presence
of inclusions, as is indicated by the exaggeratedgrain growth of tungsten wire containing thoria, orthe sudden coarsening of deoxidized steel at about1000
°C. A possible explanation for the phenomenon
is that in some regions the grain boundaries become
free (e.g. if the inclusions slowly dissolve or the
boundary tears away) and as a result the grain sizein such regions becomes appreciably larger than theaverage (Figure 7.56a). It then follows that the grain
Figure 7.56 Grain growth during secondary
recrystallization .boundary junction angles between the large grain
and the small ones that surround it will not satisfy
the condition of equilibrium discussed above. As aconsequence, further grain boundary movement to
achieve 120
°angles will occur, and the accompanying
movement of a triple junction point will be as shownin Figure 7.56b. However, when the dihedral anglesat each junction are approximately 120
°a severe
curvature in the grain boundary segments between
the junctions will arise, and this leads to an increasein grain boundary area. Movement of these curved
boundary segments towards their centres of curvature
must then take place and this will give rise to theconﬁguration shown in Figure 7.56c. Clearly, this
sequence of events can be repeated and continued
growth of the large grains will result.
The behaviour of the dispersed phase is extremely
important in secondary recrystallization and there are
many examples in metallurgical practice where the
control of secondary recrystallization with dispersedparticles has been used to advantage. One example
is in the use of Fe–3% Si in the production of strip
for transformer laminations. This material is requiredwith⊿110/triangleleft[001] ‘Goss’texture because of the [001]
easy direction of magnetization, and it is found that
the presence of MnS particles favours the growth of
secondary grains with the appropriate Goss texture.Another example is in the removal of the pores during
the sintering of metal and ceramic powders, such as
alumina and metallic carbides. The sintering processis essentially one of vacancy creep involving thediffusion of vacancies from the pore of radius rto
a neighbouring grain boundary, under a driving force
2/CR
s/rwhere /CRsis the surface energy. In practice,
sintering occurs fairly rapidly up to about 95% full
density because there is a plentiful association of
boundaries and pores. When the pores become verysmall, however, they are no longer able to anchorthe grain boundaries against the grain growth forces,
and hence the pores sinter very slowly, since they
are stranded within the grains some distance fromany boundary. To promote total sintering, an effective
dispersionisadded.Thedispersioniscritical,however,
since it must produce sufﬁcient drag to slow downgrain growth, during which a particular pore is crossed
by several migrating boundaries, but not sufﬁciently
large to give rise to secondary recrystallization when agiven pore would be stranded far from any boundary.
The relation between grain-size, temperature and
strain is shown in Figure 7.57 for commercially
pure aluminium. From this diagram it is clearthat either a critical strain-anneal treatment or a
secondary recrystallization process may be used for
the preparation of perfect strain-free single crystals.
7.8.5 Annealing twins
A prominent feature of the microstructures of most
annealed fcc metals and alloys is the presence of
manystraight-sidedbandsthatrunacrossgrains.These
244Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Figure 7.57 Relation between grain size, deformation and
temperature for aluminium (after Buergers, courtesy of
Akademie-Verlags-Gesellschaft) .
bands have a twinned orientation relative to their
neighbouring grain and are referred to as annealing
twins (see Chapter 4). The parallel boundaries usually
coincide with a ⊿111/trianglelefttwinning plane with the
structure coherent across it, i.e. both parts of the twinhold a single ⊿111/triangleleftplane in common.
As with formation of deformation twins, it is
believed that a change in stacking sequence is allthat is necessary to form an annealing twin. Sucha change in stacking sequence may occur whenevera properly oriented grain boundary migrates. Forexample, if the boundary interface corresponds to a⊿111/triangleleftplane, growth will proceed by the deposition of
additional ⊿111/triangleleftplanes in the usual stackingsequence
ABCABC .... If, however, the next newly deposited
layer falls into the wrong position, the sequence
ABCABCB is produced which constitutes the ﬁrst
layerofatwin.Onceatwininterfaceisformed,furthergrowth may continue with the sequence in reverseorder,ABCABC jBACB ...until a second accident
in the stacking sequence completes the twin band,ABCABCBACBACBABC . When a stacking error,
such as that described above, occurs the number ofnearest neighbours is unchanged, so that the ease offormation of a twin interface depends on the relativevalue of the interface energy. If this interface energy
is low, as in copper where /CR
twin<20 mJ/m2twinning
occurs frequently while if it is high, as in aluminium,the process is rare.
Annealing twins are rarely (if ever) found in cast
metals because grain boundary migration is negligibleduring casting. Worked and annealed metals showconsiderabletwinbandformation;afterextensivegraingrowth a coarse-grained metal often contains twins
which are many times wider than any grain that was
present shortly after recrystallization. This indicatesthat twin bands grow in width, during grain growth,by migration in a direction perpendicular to the ⊿111/triangleleft
composition plane, and one mechanism whereby thiscan occur is illustrated schematically in Figure 7.58.This shows that a twin may form at the corner of a

Burke and Turnbull, 1952; courtesy of Pergamon Press) .
grain, since the grain boundary conﬁguration will then
have a lower interfacial energy. If this happens thetwin will then be able to grow in width because one ofits sides forms part of the boundary of the growing
grain. Such a twin will continue to grow in width
until a second mistake in the positioning of the atomiclayers terminates it; a complete twin band is thenformed. In copper and its alloys /CR
twin//CRgbis low and
hence twins occur frequently, whereas in aluminiumthe corresponding ratio is very much higher and so
twins are rare.
Twinsmaydevelopaccordingtothemodelshownin
Figure 7.59 where during grain growth a grain contact
is established between grains C and D. Then if the
orientation of grain D is close to the twin orientationof grain C, the nucleation of an annealing twin atthe grain boundary, as shown in Figure 7.60d, willlower the total boundary energy. This follows because
the twin/D interface will be reduced to about 5% of
the normal grain boundary energy, the energies of theC/A and twin/A interface will be approximately thesame, and the extra area of interface C/twin has only a

very low energy. This model indicates that the number
of twins per unit grain boundary area only depends
on the number of new grain contacts made duringgrain growth, irrespective of grain size and annealing
temperature.
7.8.6 Recrystallization textures
Thepreferredorientationdevelopedbycoldworkoften
changes on recrystallization to a totally different pre-
ferred orientation. To explain this observation, Bar-
rett and (later) Beck have put forward the ‘orientedgrowth’ theory of recrystallization textures in which
it is proposed that nuclei of many orientations ini-
tially form but, because the rate of growth of anygiven nucleus depends on the orientation difference
between the matrix and growing crystal, the recrystal-
lized texture will arise from those nuclei which havethe fastest growth rate in the cold-worked matrix, i.e.those bounded by large-angle boundaries. It then fol-
lows that because the matrix has a texture, all the
nuclei which grow will have orientations that differ by30–40
°from the cold-worked texture. This explains
why the new texture in fcc metals is often related to
the old texture, by a rotation of approximately 30–40 °
around h111iaxes, in bcc metals by 30 °about h110i
a n di nh c pb y3 0 °about h0001 i. However, while
it is undoubtedly true that oriented growth provides
a selection between favourable and unfavourable ori-ented nuclei, there are many observations to indicate
that the initial nucleation is not entirely random. For
instance,becauseofthecrystallographicsymmetryonewould expect grains appearing in a fcc texture to berelated to rotationsabout all four h111iaxes, i.e. eight
orientations arising from two possible rotations about
each of the four h111iaxes. All these possible orien-
tations are rarely (if ever) observed.
To account for such observations, and for those
cases where the deformation texture and the annealingtexture show strong similarities, oriented nucleationis considered to be important. The oriented nucle-
ation theory assumes that the selection of orientations
is determined in the nucleation stage. It is generallyacceptedthatallrecrystallizationnucleipre-existinthe
deformed matrix, as sub-grains, which become more
perfect through recovery processes prior to recrystal-lization. It is thus most probable that there is some
selection of nuclei determined by the representation of
the orientationsinthe deformation texture, andthat theoriented nucleation theory should apply in some cases.In many cases the orientations which are strongly rep-
resented in the annealing texture are very weakly rep-
resented in the deformed material. The most strikingexample is the ‘cube’ texture, (100) [001], found in
mostfccpuremetalswhichhavebeenannealedfollow-
ing heavy rolling reductions. In this texture, the cubeaxes are extremely well aligned along the sheet axes,and its behaviour resembles that of a single crystal.
It is thus clear that cube-oriented grains or sub-grains
must have a very high initial growth rate in order toform the remarkably strong quasi-single-crystal cube
texture. The percentage of cubically aligned grainsincreases with increased deformation, but the sharp-
ness of the textures is profoundly affected by alloying
additions. The amount of alloying addition requiredto suppress the texture depends on those factors which
affect the stacking fault energy, such as the lattice mis-
ﬁt of the solute atom in the solvent lattice, valencyetc., in much the same way as that described for the
transition of a pure metal deformation texture.
In general, however, if the texture is to be altered
a distribution of second-phase must either be present
before cold rolling or be precipitated during anneal-
ing. In aluminium, for example, the amount of cubetexture can be limited in favour of retained rolling
texture by limiting the amount of grain growth with
a precipitate dispersion of Si and Fe. By balancingthe components, earing can be minimized in drawn
aluminium cups. In aluminium-killed steels AlN pre-
cipitation prior to recrystallization produces a higherproportion of grains with f111gplanes parallel to
the rolling plane and a high
Rvalue suitable for
deep drawing. The AlN dispersion affects sub-graingrowth, limiting the available nuclei and increasing
the orientation-selectivity, thereby favouring the high-
energy f111ggrains. Improved
R-values in steels in
general are probably due to the combined effect of
particles in homogenizingthe deformed microstructure
and in controlling the subsequent sub-grain growth.The overall effect is to limit the availability of nuclei
with orientations other than f111g.
7.9 Metallic creep
7.9.1 Transient and steady-state creep
Creep is the process by which plastic ﬂow occurs
when a constant stress is applied to a metal for a
prolonged period of time. After the initial strain ε0
whichfollowstheapplicationoftheload,creepusually
exhibits a rapid transient period of ﬂow (stage 1)
before it settles down to the linear steady-stage stage2 which eventually gives way to tertiary creep and
fracture. Transient creep, sometimes referred to as ˇ-
creep, obeys a t
1/3law. The linear stage of creep is
often termed steady-state creep and obeys the relation
εD/DC4t (7.49)
Consequently, because both transient and steady-state
creep usually occur together during creep at high
temperatures, the complete curve (Figure 7.60) during
the primary and secondary stages of creep ﬁts theequation
εDˇt
1/3C/DC4t (7.50)
extremely well. In contrast to transient creep, steady-
state creep increases markedly with both temperature

and stress. At constant stress the dependence on tem-
perature is given by

Steady-state creep is therefore described by the
equation
PεssDA⊿/ESC/E/triangleleftnexp⊿/NULQ/kT/triangleleft (7.53)
The basic assumption of the mechanism of steady-
state creep is that during the creep process the rateof recoveryr(i.e. decrease in strength ⊿d/ESC/dt/triangleleft)i s

To prevent work hardening,both the screw and edge
parts of a glissile dislocation loop must be able toescape from tangled or piled-up regions. The edgedislocationswill, of course, escape by climb, and sincethis process requires a higher activation energy thancross-slip, it will be the rate-controlling process insteady-state creep. The rate of recovery is governed
by the rate of climb, which depends on diffusion and
stress such that

The structure developed in creep arises from the
simultaneous work-hardening and recovery. The dis-location density /SUBincreases with εand the disloca-
tion network gets ﬁner, since dislocation spacing is
proportional to /SUB
/NUL1/2. At the same time, the dislo-
cations tend to reduce their strain energy by mutualannihilation and rearrange to form low-angle bound-aries and this increases the network spacing. Straining
then proceeds at a rate at which the reﬁning action
just balances the growth of the network by recov-ery; the equilibrium network size being determined bythe stress. Although dynamical recovery can occur bycross-slip, the rate-controlling process in steady-statecreep is climb whereby edge dislocations climb out oftheir glide planes by absorbing or emitting vacancies;
the activation energy is therefore that of self-diffusion.

1The climb process may, of course, be important
in several different ways. Thus, climb may help a glis-sile dislocation to circumvent different barriers in thestructure such as a sessile dislocation, or it may lead tothe annihilation of dislocations of opposite sign on dif-ferent glide planes. Moreover, because creep-resistantmaterialsare rarelypuremetals,theclimbprocessmayalso be important in allowing a glissile dislocation toget round a precipitate or move along a grain bound-ary. A comprehensive analysis of steady-state creep,based on the climb of dislocations, has been given byWeertman.

at low stresses (i.e. regime I) creep occurs not by dis-
location glide and climb but by stress-directed ﬂow of

7.9.2 Grain boundary contribution to creep
In the creep of polycrystals at high temperatures the
grain boundaries themselves are able to play an impor-
tant part in the deformation process due to the fact that

they may (1) slide past each other or (2) create vacan-
cies. Both processes involve an activation energy for
diffusion and therefore may contribute to steady-statecreep.
Grain boundary sliding during creep was inferred
initially from the observation of steps at theboundaries, but the mechanism of sliding can be
demonstrated on bi-crystals. Figure 7.65 shows a good
example of grain boundary movement in a bi-crystalof tin, where the displacement of the straight grain
boundary across its middle is indicated by marker
scratches. Grain boundaries, even when speciallyproduced for bi-crystal experiments, are not perfectly
straight, and after a small amount of sliding at the
boundary interface, movement will be arrested byprotuberances. The grains are then locked, and the
rate of slip will be determined by the rate of plastic
ﬂow in the protuberances. As a result, the rate ofslip along a grain boundary is not constant with
time, because the dislocations ﬁrst form into piled-
up groups, and later these become relaxed. Local
relaxation may be envisaged as a process in which
the dislocations in the pile-up climb towards theboundary. In consequence, the activation energy for
grain boundary slip may be identiﬁed with that for
steady-state creep. After climb, the dislocations arespread more evenly along the boundary, and are thus
able to give rise to grain boundary migration, when
sliding has temporarily ceased, which is proportionalto the overall deformation.
A second creep process which also involves the
grain boundaries is one in which the boundary acts

as a source and sink for vacancies. The mechanism
depends on the migration of vacancies from one side
of a grain to another, as shown in Figure 7.66, and
is often termed Herring–Nabarro creep, after the two
workers who originally considered this process. If, in

7.9.3 Tertiary creep and fracture
Tertiary creep and fracture are logically consideredtogether, since the accelerating stage represents theinitiation of conditions which lead to fracture. In
many cases the onset of accelerating creep is an
indication that voids or cracks are slowly but continu-ously forming in the material, and this has been con-ﬁrmed by metallography and density measurements.
The type of fracture resulting from tertiary creep is not
transcrystalline but grain boundary fracture. Two typesof grain boundary fracture have been observed. Theﬁrst occurs principally at the triple point formed where
three grain boundaries meet, and sliding along bound-
aries on which there is a shear stress produces stressconcentrations at the point of conjunction sufﬁcientlyhightostartcracks.However,underconditionsofslowstrain rate for long times, which would be expected to
favour recovery, small holesform ongrain boundaries,
especially those perpendicular to the tensile axis, andthese gradually grow and coalesce.
Second-phase particles play an important part in
the nucleation of cracks and cavities by concentrating
stress in sliding boundaries and at the intersection ofslipbandswithparticlesbutthesestressconcentrationsare greatly reduced by plastic deformation by power-
law creep and by diffusional processes. Cavity forma-
tion and early growth is therefore intimately linked to
the creep process itself and the time-to-fracture cor-
relates well with the minimum creep rate for manystructural materials. Fracture occurs when the larger,
more closely spaced cavities coalesce. Creep fracture
is discussed further in Chapter 8.
7.9.4 Creep-resistant alloy design
The problem of the design of engineering creep-
resistant alloys is complex, and the optimum alloy for
a given service usually contains several constituents
in various states of solution and precipitation. Never-
theless, it is worth considering some of the principlesunderlying creep-resistant behaviour in the light of the
preceding theories.
First, let us consider the strengthening of the solid
solution by those mechanisms which cause disloca-
tion locking and those which contribute to lattice
friction hardening. The former include solute atoms
interacting with (1) the dislocation or (2) the stacking
fault. Friction hardening can arise from (1) the stressﬁelds around individual atoms (i.e. the Mott–Nabarro
effect), (2) clusters of solute atoms in solid solutions,
(3) by increasing the separation of partial dislocations
and so making climb, cross-slip and intersection more
difﬁcult, (4) by the solute atoms becoming attachedto jogs and thereby impeding climb, and (5) by inﬂu-
encing the energies of formation and migration of
vacancies. The alloy can also be hardened by precipi-tation, and it is signiﬁcant that many of the successful
industrialcreep-resistantalloysareofthistype(e.g.the
nickel alloys, and both ferritic and austenitic steels).
The effectiveness of these various methods of con-
ferring strength on the alloy will depend on the con-ditions of temperature and stress during creep. All
the effects should play some part during fast primary
creep, but during the slow secondary creep stage the
impeding of dislocation movement by solute locking
effects will probably be small. This is because moderncreep-resistant alloys are in service up to tempera-
tures of about two-thirds the absolute melting point
⊿T/T
m'2
3/triangleleftof the parent metal, whereas above about
T/Tm'1
2solute atoms will migrate as fast as dis-
locations. Hardening which relies on clusters will be
more difﬁcult to remove than that which relies upon
single atoms and should be effective up to higher tem-
peratures. However, for any hardening mechanism to
be really effective, whether it is due to solute atom
clusters or actual precipitation, the rate of climb andcross-slip past the barriers must be slow. Accordingly,
the most probable role of solute alloying elements in
modern creep-resistant alloys is in reducing the rateof climb and cross-slip processes. The three hardening
mechanisms listed as 3, 4 and 5 above are all effective
in this way. From this point of view, it is clear that
the best parent metals on which to base creep-resistant
alloys will be those in which climb and cross-slip
250Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
is difﬁcult; these include the fcc and cph metals of
low stacking-fault energy, for which the slip disloca-tions readily dissociate. Generally, the creep rate isdescribed by the empirical relation

whereAis a constant, n,mstress and fault energy
exponents, respectively, and Dthe diffusivity; for
fcc materials m³3a n dn³4. The reason for the
goodcreep strengthof austeniticandNi-base materials
containing Co, Cr, etc. arises from their low fault
energyandalsobecauseoftheirrelativelyhighmeltingpoint whenDis small.
From the above discussion it appears that a suc-
cessful creep-resistant material would be an alloy, the
compositionofwhichgivesastructurewithahardenedsolid–solution matrix containing a sufﬁcient numberof precipitated particles to force glissile partial dis-locations either to climb or to cross-slip to circum-
vent them. The constitution of the Nimonic alloys,
which consist of a nickel matrix containing dissolvedchromium,titanium,aluminiumandcobalt,isinaccor-dance with these principles, and since no large atomic
sizefactorsareinvolveditappearsthatoneofthefunc-
tions of these additions is to lower the stacking-faultenergy and thus widen the separation of the partialdislocations. A second object of the titanium and alu-
minium alloy additions
1is to produce precipitation,
and in the Nimonic alloys much of the precipitate is
Ni3Al.Thisprecipitateisisomorphouswiththematrix,
and while it has a parameter difference ⊿³1

enough to give a low interfacial energy, it is, neverthe-
less, sufﬁciently large to give a source of hardening.Thus, since the energy of the interface provides thedrivingforce forparticlegrowth,thislow-energyinter-
face between particle and matrix ensures a low rate of
particle growth and hence a high service temperature.
Grain boundary precipitation is advantageous in
reducing grain boundary sliding. Alternatively, theweakness of the grain boundaries may be eliminated
altogether by using single-crystal material. Nimonic
alloys used for turbine blades have been manufacturedin single-crystal form by directional solidiﬁcation (seeChapters 3 and 10).
Dispersions are effective in conferring creep
strength by two mechanisms. First the particle will

slip. Second, and more important, is the retardingeffect on recovery as shown by some dispersions,

2O3(extruded),SAP(sinteredaluminapowder),
and Ni–ThO 2which retain their hardness almost to
the melting point. A comparison of SAP with a
‘conventional’ complex aluminium alloy shows thatat 250
°C there is little to choose between them but
at 400°C SAP is several times stronger. Generally,
the dislocation network formed by strain-hardening
interconnects the particles and is thereby anchored
by them. To do this effectively, the particle must bestable at the service temperature and remain ﬁnely
dispersed. This depends on the solubility C,d i f f u s i o n

offers little scope for adjustment; great importance is
therefore placed on /CR1as for the Ni 3(TiAl) phase in
Nimonics where it is very low.

taining a dislocation substructure. This demonstrates
the importance of substructure and probably indicates
that in completely recrystallized alloys containing a
dispersoid, the particles control the creep behaviour,
whereas in alloys containing a substructure the dis-location content is more important. Since n³4f o r

ture regimes, the operative deformation mechanism is
likely to be the same, but it is clear from the activation
energies, listed in Table 7.4, that the rate-controllingthermally activated process changes with temperature.
The activation energy is greater at the higher tem-
perature when it is also, surprisingly, composition (or
stacking-fault energy) independent.
Such behaviour may be explained, if it is assumed
that the particles are bypassed by cross-slip (see
Chapter 8) and this process is easy at all temperatures,
but it is the climb of the edge segments of the cross-
slipped dislocations that is rate-controlling. At low
temperatures, climb would proceed by pipe-diffusion

threshold (or friction) stress /ESC0, so that the effective stress

so that the composition-dependence relates to the vari-
ation in the ease of pipe-diffusion along dislocations
of different widths.At high temperatures, climb occurs
by bulk diffusion and the absence of any composition-dependence is due to the fact that in these alloysthe jog distribution is determined mainly by disloca-tion/particle interactions and not, as in single-phasealloysand in dispersion-strengthenedalloyscontaining
asubstructure,bythematrixstacking-faultenergy.The
optimum creep resistance of dispersion-strengthenedalloys is produced when a uniform dislocation net-work in a ﬁbrous grain structure is anchored by theparticles and recovery is minimized. Such a structure
can reduce the creep rate by several orders of mag-
nitude from that given in Figure 7.63, but it dependscritically upon the working and heat-treatment used infabricating the alloy.
Second-phase particles can also inhibit diffusion
creep. Figure 7.67 shows the distribution of particles
before and after diffusion creep and indicates thatthe longitudinal boundaries tend to collect precipi-tates as vacancies are absorbed and the boundariesmigrate inwards, while the tensile boundaries acquirea PFZ. Such a structural change has been observed in
Mg–0.5%Zr ( Magnox ZR55 ) at 400
°C and is accom-
panied by a reduced creep rate. It is not anticipatedthat diffusion is signiﬁcantly affected by the presenceof particles and hence the effect is thought to be due to
the particles affecting the vacancy-absorbing capabil-
ities of the grain boundaries. Whatever mechanism isenvisaged for the annihilation of vacancies at a grainboundary, the climb-glide of grain boundary disloca-tions is likely to be involved and such a process willbe hindered by the presence of particles.
7.10 Deformation mechanism maps
The discussion in this chapter has emphasized thatover a range of stress and temperature an alloy iscapable of deforming by several alternative and inde-pendent mechanisms, e.g. dislocation creep with eitherpipe diffusion at low temperatures and lattice diffusionat high temperatures being the rate-controlling mecha-
nism, and diffusional creep with either grain-boundary

diffusion or lattice diffusion being important. In a par-
ticular range of temperature, one of these mechanisms
is dominant and it is therefore useful in engineeringapplication to identify the operative mechanism for agiven stress–temperature condition, since it is ineffec-

the diagrams it is evident that solid solution strength-eningandprecipitation-hardeninghave raisedtheyield
stress and reduced the dislocation creep ﬁeld. The
shaded boxes shown in Figure 7.68 indicate the typi-cal stresses and temperatures to which a turbine bladewould be subjected; it is evident that the mechanismof creep during operation has changed and, indeed, the
creep rate is reduced by several orders of magnitude.
7.11 Metallic fatigue
7.11.1 Nature of fatigue failure
The term fatigue applies to the behaviour of a metal
which, when subjected to a cyclically variable stressof sufﬁcient magnitude (often below the yield stress)produces a detectable change in mechanical properties.
In practice, a large number of service failures are due
to fatigue, and so engineers are concerned mainly withfatiguefailurewherethespecimenisactuallyseparatedinto two parts. Some of these failures can be attributedto poor design of the component, but in some can
be ascribed to the condition of the material. Conse-quently, the treatment of fatigue may be conveniently
divided into three aspects: (1) engineering consider-
ations, (2) gross metallurgical aspects, and (3) ﬁne-
scale structural and atomic changes.
The fatigue conditions which occur in service
are usually extremely complex. Common failures
are found in axles where the eccentric load at a
wheel or pulley produces a varying stress which is
a maximum in the skin of the axle. Other examples,
such as the ﬂexure stresses produced in aircraft wingsand in undercarriages during ground taxi-ing, do,
however, emphasize that the stress system does not
necessarily vary in a regular sinusoidal manner. The
series of aircraft disasters attributed to pressurized-
cabin failures is perhaps the most spectacular exampleof this type of fatigue failure.
7.11.2 Engineering aspects of fatigue
In laboratory testing of materials the stress system isusually simpliﬁed, and both the Woehler and push-pulltype of test are in common use. The results are usually
plotted on the familiar S–Ncurve (i.e. stress versus
the number of cycles to failure, usually plotted on a
logarithmic scale). Ferritic steels may be considered
to exhibit a genuine fatigue limit with a fatigue ratioS/TS³0.5. However, other materials, such as alu-
minium or copper-based alloys, certainly those of the
age-hardening variety, deﬁnitely do not show a sharp
discontinuity in the S–Ncurve. For these materials
no fatigue limit exists and all that can be speciﬁed isthe endurance limit at Ncycles. The importance of
the effect is illustrated by the behaviour of commer-
cial aluminium-based alloys containing zinc, magne-
sium and copper. Such an alloy may have a TS of
Mechanical behaviour of materials 253
617 MN/m2but the fatigue stress for a life of 108
cycles is only 154 MN/m2(i.e. a fatigue ratio at 108
cycles of 0.25).
The amplitude of the stress cycle to which the spec-
imen is subjected is the most important single variablein determining its life under fatigue conditions, but the
performance of a material is also greatly affected by
various other conditions, which may be summarized
as follows:
1.Surface preparation Since fatigue cracks frequently
start at or near the surface of the component, the
surface condition is an important consideration in
fatigue life. The removal of machining marks and
other surface irregularities invariably improves the
fatigue properties. Putting the surface layers under
compression by shot peening or surface treatment
improves the fatigue life.
2.Effectoftemperature Temperatureaffectsthefatigue
properties in much the same way as it does the ten-
sile strength (TS); the fatigue strength is highest at
low temperatures and decreases gradually with ris-
ing temperature. For mild steel the ratio of fatigue
limit to TS remains fairly constant at about 0.5,
while the ratio of fatigue limit to yield stress varies
over much wider limits. However, if the tempera-
ture is increased above about 100
°C, both the tensile
strength and the fatigue strength of mild steel show
an increase, reaching a maximum value between
200°C and 400 °C. This increase, which is not com-
monly found in other materials, has been attributed
to strain-ageing.
3.Frequency of stress cycle In most metals the fre-
quency of the stress cycle has little effect on the
fatiguelife, althoughloweringthe frequency usually
results in a slightly reduced fatigue life. The effect
becomes greater if the temperature of the fatigue
test is raised, when the fatigue life tends to dependon the total time of testing rather than on the num-
berofcycles.Withmildsteel,however, experimentsshow that the normal speed effect is reversed in a
certain temperature range and the number of cycles
to failure increases with decrease in the frequency
of the stress cycle. This effect may be correlated
with the inﬂuence of temperature and strain-rate
on the TS. The temperature at which the tensile
strength reaches a maximum depends on the rate
of strain, and it is, therefore, not surprising that the
temperature at which the fatigue strength reaches a
maximum depends on the cyclic frequency.
4.Mean stress For conditions of fatigue where the

following relationship will hold
n1/N1Cn2/N2C...Dn/ND1 (7.61)
5.Environment Fatigue occurring in a corrosive envi-
ronment is usually referred to as corrosion fatigue.
It is well known that corrosive attack by a liquid
medium can produce etch pits which may act as
notches, but when the corrosive attack is simultane-
ous with fatigue stressing, the detrimental effect is
far greater than just a notch effect. Moreover, from
microscopic observations the environment appears
to have a greater effect on crack propagation than
on crack initiation. For most materials even atmo-
spheric oxygen decreases the fatigue life by inﬂu-
encing the speed of crack propagation, and it is
possible to obtain a relationship between fatigue life
andthedegreeofvacuuminwhichthespecimenhas
been held.
It is now well established that fatigue starts at the
surface of the specimen. This is easy to understand
in the Woehler test because, in this test, it is therethat the stress is highest. However, even in push–pull
fatigue, the surface is important for several reasons:
(1) slip is easier at the surface than in the interior
of the grains, (2) the environment is in contact with
the surface, and (3) any specimen misalignment will
alwaysgivehigherstressesatthesurface.Accordingly,
any alteration in surface properties must bring about
a change in the fatigue properties. The best fatigue
resistance occurs in materials with a worked surface
layer produced by polishing with emery, shot-peening
or skin-rolling the surface. This beneﬁcial effect of a
worked surface layer is principally due to the fact that
the surface is put into compression, but the increased
TS as a result of work hardening also plays a part.
Electropolishing the specimen by removing the sur-
face layers usually has a detrimental effect on the
fatigue properties, but other common surface prepara-
tions such as nitriding and carburizing, both of which
produce a surface layer which is in compression, may
be beneﬁcial. Conversely, such surface treatments as
the decarburizing of steels and the cladding of alu-
minium alloys with pure aluminium, increase their
susceptibility to fatigue.
The alloy composition and thermal and mechanical
history of the specimen are also of importance in the
fatigue process. Any treatment which increases the
hardness or yield strength of the material will increase
the level of the stress needed to produce slip and, as
we shall see later, since the fundamental processesof fatigue are largely associated with slip, this leads
directly to an increase in fatigue strength. It is alsoclear that grain size is a relevant factor: the smallerthe grain size, the higher is the fatigue strength at agiven temperature.
The fatigue processes in stable alloys are essen-
tially the same as those of pure metals but there is, ofcourse, an increase in fatigue strength. However, the
processes in unstable alloys and in materials exhibit-
ing a yield point are somewhat different. In fatigue,as in creep, structural instability frequently leads toenhancementofthefundamentalprocesses.Inallcasesthe approach to equilibrium is more complete, sothat in age-hardening materials, solution-treated speci-mens become harder and fullyaged specimens become
softer. The changes which occur are local rather than
general,andareassociatedwiththeenhanceddiffusionbrought about by the production of vacancies duringthe fatigue test. Clearly, since vacancy mobility is athermally activated process such effects can be sup-pressed at sufﬁciently low temperatures.
Ingeneral,non-ferrousalloysdonotexhibitthetype
of fatigue limit shown by mild steel. One exception
to this generalization is the alloy aluminium 2–7%
magnesium, 0.5% manganese, and it is interesting tonote that this alloy also has a sharp yield point andshows L¨uders markings in an ordinary tensile test.
Accordingly, it has been suggested that the fatiguelimit occupies a similar place in the ﬁeld of alternat-ing stresses to that ﬁlled by the yield point in uni-
directional stressing. Stresses above the fatigue limit
readily unlock the dislocations from their solute atomatmospheres, while below the fatigue limit most dis-locations remain locked. In support of this view, itis found that when the carbon and nitrogen contentof mild steel is reduced, by annealing in wet hydro-gen, striking changes take place in the fatigue limit(Figure 7.5) as well as in the sharp yield point.
7.11.3 Structural changes accompanying
fatigue
Observations of the structural details underlying
fatigue hardening show that in polycrystals largevariations in slip-band distributions and the amount oflattice misorientation exist from one grain to another.Because of such variations it is difﬁcult to typifystructuralchanges,sothatinrecentyearsthisstructural
work has been carried out more and more on single
crystals;inparticular,copperhasreceivedconsiderableattention as being representative of a typical metal.Such studies have now established that fatigue occursas a result of slip, the direction of which changeswith the stress cycle, and that the process continuesthroughout the whole of the test (shown, for example,by interrupting a test and removing the slip bands by
polishing; the bands reappear on subsequent testing).
Moreover, four stages in the fatigue life of a
specimen are distinguishable; these may be summa-rized as follows. In the early stages of the test, the
Mechanical behaviour of materials 255
whole of the specimen hardens. After about 5% of the
life, slip becomes localized and persistent slip bandsappear; they are termed persistent because they reap-pear and are not permanently removed by electropol-ishing. Thus, reverse slip does not continue throughoutthe whole test in the bulk of the metal (the matrix).Electron microscope observations show that metal isextruded from the slip bands and that ﬁne crevicescalled intrusions are formed within the band. Dur-ing the third stage of the fatigue life the slip bandsgrow laterally and become wider, and at the same timecracks develop in them. These cracks spread initiallyalong slip bands, but in the later stages of fracture thepropagation of the crack is often not conﬁned to cer-tain crystallographic directions and catastrophic rup-ture occurs. These two important crack growth stages,i.e. stageI intheslipbandandstageIIroughlyperpen-diculartotheprincipalstress,areshowninFigure 7.70and are inﬂuenced by the formation of localized (per-sistent) slip bands (i.e. PSBs). However, PSBs are notclearly deﬁned inlow stackingfault energy, solidsolu-tion alloys.
Cyclic stressing therefore produces plastic deforma-
tion which is not fully reversible and the build-up of
dislocation density within grains gives rise to fatigue
hardening with an associated structure which is char-acteristic of the strain amplitude and the ability of thedislocations to cross-slip, i.e. temperature and SFE.The non-reversible ﬂow at the surface leads to intru-sions, extrusions and crack formation in PSBs. Thesetwo aspects will now be considered separately and ingreater detail.
Fatigue hardening If a single or polycrystalline
specimen is subjected to many cycles of alternat-ing stress, it becomes harder than a similar specimen
extended uni-directionally by the same stress applied
only once. This may be demonstrated by stoppingthe fatigue test and performing a static tensile teston the specimen when, as shown in Figure 7.71, theyield stress is increased. During the process, persis-tent slip bands appear on the surface of the specimenand it is in such bands that cracks eventually form.The behaviour of a fatigue-hardened specimen has

and stage I and stage II crack growth .
two unusual features when compared with an ordi-
nary work-hardened material. The fatigue-hardened
material, having been stressed symmetrically, has the
sameyieldstressincompressionasintension,whereas
the work-hardened specimen (e.g. prestrained in ten-sion)exhibitsa Bauschingereffect, i.e. weaker incom-
pression than tension. It arises from the fact that the
obstacles behind the dislocation are weaker than those
resisting further dislocation motion, and the pile-up
stress causes it to slip back under a reduced load in
the reverse direction. The other important feature is
Figure 7.71 Stress–strain curves for copper after increasing amounts of fatigue testing (after Broom and Ham, 1959) .
256Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
that the temperature-dependence of the hardening pro-
duced by fatigue is signiﬁcantly greater than that of
work-hardening and, because of the similarity with
the behaviour of metals hardened by quenching and
by irradiation, it has been attributed to the effect ofvacancies and dislocation loops created during fatigue.
At the start of cyclic deformation the initial slip
bands (Figure 7.72a) consist largely of primary dis-locations in the form of dipole and multipole arrays;
the number of loops is relatively small because the
frequency of cross-slip is low. As the specimen work-hardens slip takes place between the initial slip bands,
and the new slip bands contain successively more
secondary dislocations because of the internal stressarising from nearby slip bands (Figure 7.72b). When
the specimen is completely ﬁlled with slip bands, the
specimen has work-hardened and the softest regions
are now those where slip occurred originally since
these bands contain the lowest density of secondarydislocations.Further slipand the development of PSBs
takes place within these original slip bands, as shown
schematically in Figure 7.72c
As illustrated schematically in Figure 7.73, TEM of
coppercrystalsshowsthatthemaindifferencebetween
the matrix and the PSBs is that in the matrix the densearrays of edge dislocation (di- and multipoles) are in
the form of large veins occupying about 50% of the
volume, whereas they form a ‘ladder’-type structurewithin walls occupying about 10% of the volume in
PSBs. The PSBs are the active regions in the fatigue
process while the matrix is associatedwith the inactiveparts of the specimen between the PSBs. Steady-
state deformation then takes place by the to-and-fro
glide of the same dislocations in the matrix, whereas
an equilibrium between dislocation multiplication and

annihilation exists in the PSBs. Multiplication occurs
bybowing-outofthewallsandannihilationtakesplaceby interaction with edge dislocations of opposite sign(³75b apart) on glide planes in the walls and of screw
dislocations ( ³200b apart) on glide planes in the low-
dislocation channels, the exact distance depending onthe ease of cross-slip.
7.11.4 Crack formation and fatigue failure
Extrusions,intrusionsandfatiguecrackscanbeformedat temperatures as low as 4 K where thermally acti-vated movement of vacancies does not take place.Such observations indicate that the formation of intru-sions and cracks cannot depend on either chemical orthermal action and the mechanism must be a purelygeometricalprocesswhichdependsoncyclicstressing.
Two general mechanisms have been suggested. The
ﬁrst, the Cottrell ‘ratchet’ mechanism, involves theuse of two different slip systems with different direc-tions and planes of slip, as is shown schematicallyin Figure 7.74. The most favoured source (e.g. S
1in
Figure 7.74a) produces a slip step on the surface at P
during a tensile half-cycle. At a slightly greater stressin the same half-cycle, the second source S
2produces
Figure 7.74 Formation of intrusions and extrusions (after
Cottrell; courtesy of John Wiley and Sons) .
Mechanical behaviour of materials 257
a second step at Q(Figure 7.74b). During the com-
pression half-cycle, the source S1produces a surface
step of opposite sign at P0(Figure 7.74c), but, owing
to the displacing action of S2, this is not in the same
plane as the ﬁrst and thus an intrusion is formed. The
subsequent operation of S2produces an extrusion at
QQ0(Figure 7.74d) in a similar manner. Such a mech-
anism requires the operation of two slip systems and,
in general, predicts the occurrence of intrusions and
extrusions with comparable frequency, but not in thesame slip band.
The second mechanism, proposed by Mott, involves
cross-slipresultingina columnofmetal extrudedfromthe surface and a cavity is left behind in the interior
of the crystal. One way in which this could happen
is by the cyclic movement of a screw dislocationalong a closed circuit of crystallographic planes, asshown in Figure 7.75. During the ﬁrst half-cycle the
screw dislocation glides along two faces ABCDand
BB
0C0Cof the band, and during the second half-cycle
returns along the faces B0C0A0DandA0D0DA. Unlike
the Cottrell mechanism this process can be operated
with a single slip direction, provided cross-slip canoccur.
Neither mechanism can fully explain all the
experimental observations. The interacting slip mech-
anism predicts the occurrence of intrusions and extru-sions with comparable frequency but not, as is often
found,inthe same slipband.Withthecross-slipmech-
anism, there is no experimental evidence to show thatcavities exist beneath the material being extruded. Itmay well be that different mechanisms operate under
different conditions.
In a polycrystalline aggregate the operation of
several slip modes is necessary and intersecting slip
unavoidable. Accordingly, the widely differing fatigue
behaviour of metals may be accounted for by therelative ease with which cross-slip occurs. Thus,
those factors which affect the onset of stage III in
the work-hardening curve will also be important infatigue, and conditions suppressing cross-slip would,in general, increase the resistance to fatigue failure,
i.e. low stacking-fault energy and low temperatures.
Aluminium would be expected to have poor fatigueproperties on this basis but the unfavourable fatigue
characteristics of the high-strength aluminium alloys
Figure 7.75 Formation of an extrusion and associated
cavity by the Mott mechanism .is probably also due to the unstable nature of the alloy
and to the inﬂuence of vacancies.
In pure metals and alloys, transgranular cracks ini-
tiate at intrusions in PSBs or at sites of surface rough-
ness associated with emerging planar slip bands in
low SFE alloys. Often the microcrack forms at the
PSB-matrix interface where the stress concentration is
high. In commercial alloys containing inclusions or
second-phase particles, the fatigue behaviour dependson the particle size. Small particles ³0.1
µm can have
beneﬁcial effects by homogenizing the slip pattern
and delaying fatigue-crack nucleation. Larger parti-
cles reduce the fatigue life by both facilitating crack
nucleationbyslipband/particleinteractionandincreas-
ing crack growth rates by interface decohesion and
voiding within the plastic zone at the crack tip. The
formation of voids at particles on grain boundaries
can lead to intergranular separation and crack growth.The preferential deformation of ‘soft’ precipitate-free
zones (PFZs) associated with grain boundaries in
age-hardened alloys also provides a mechanism of
intergranular fatigue-crack initiation and growth. To
improve the fatigue behaviour it is therefore necessary
to avoid PFZs and obtain a homogeneous deforma-
tion structure and uniform precipitate distribution byheat-treatment; localized deformation in PFZs can be
restricted by a reduction in grain size.
From the general appearance of a typical fatigue

This area usually has concentric marks about the pointoforiginofthecrackwhichcorrespondtothepositions

The remainder of the fracture surface shows a typi-
cally rough transcrystalline fracture where the failure
has been catastrophic. Electron micrographs of the rel-
atively smooth area show that this surface is covered
with more or less regular contours perpendicular to thedirection of the propagation front. These fatigue stri-
ations represent the successive positions of the propa-
gation front and are spaced further apart the higher the

In (a) the crack under the ten-sile loading part of the cycle generates shear stressesat the tip. With increasing tensile load the crack opensup and new surface is created (b), separation occursin the slip band and ‘ears’ are formed at the end ofthe crack. The plastic deformation causes the crack tobe both extended and blunted (c). On the compressivepartof thecyclethe crack beginstoclose(d), theshearstressesarereversedandwithincreasingloadthecrackalmost closes (e). In this part of the cycle the new sur-face folds and the ears correspond to the new striationson the ﬁnal fracture surface. A one-to-one correlationtherefore exists between the striations and the openingand closing with ear formation. Crack growth contin-ues in this manner until it is long enough to cause the
ﬁnal instability when either brittle or ductile (due to
the reduced cross-section not being able to carry theload) failure occurs. In engineering alloys, rather thanpure metals, which contain inclusions or second-phaseparticles, cracking or voiding occurs ahead of the orig-inal crack tip rather than in the ears when the tensilestress or strain reaches a critical value. This macro-scopic stage of fracture is clearly of importance toengineersinpredictingtheworkinglifeofacomponentand has been successfully treated by the application offracture mechanics as discussed in Chapter 8.
7.11.5 Fatigue at elevated temperatures
At ambient temperature the fatigue process involvesintracrystalline slip and surface initiation of cracks,followed by transcrystalline propagation. When
fatigued at elevated temperatures
/H113540.5Tm, pure metals
and solid solutions show the formation of discrete
cavities on grain boundaries, which grow, link up
and ﬁnally produce failure. It is probable that
vacancies produced by intracrystalline slip give rise
to a supersaturation which causes the vacancies to
condense on those grain boundaries that are under a
high shear stress where the cavities can be nucleated
by a sliding or ratchet mechanism. It is considered
unlikely that grain boundary sliding contributes tocavity growth, increasing the grain size decreases the
cavity growth because of the change in boundary area.
Magnox(Mg) andalloysused innuclear reactors up to
0.75T
mreadily form cavities, but the high-temperature
nickel-base alloys do not show intergranular cavity
formation during fatigue at temperatures within their
normal service range, because intracrystalline slip
is inhibited by /CR0precipitates. Above about 0 .7Tm,
however, the /CR0precipitates coarsen or dissolve and
fatigue then produce cavities and eventually cavity
failure.

Strengthening and toughening
8.1 Introduction
The production of materials which possess consider-
able strength at both room and elevated temperatures
is of great practical importance. We have already seen
how alloying, solute-dislocation interaction, grain sizecontrol and cold-working can give rise to an increasedyieldstress.Ofthesemethods,reﬁningthegrainsizeisof universal application to materials in which the yieldstress has a signiﬁcant dependence upon grain size.In certain alloy systems, it is possible to produce anadditional increase in strength and hardness by heat-treatment alone. Such a method has many advantages,since the required strength can be induced at the mostconvenient stage of production or fabrication; more-over, the component is not sent into service in a highly
stressed, plastically deformed state. The basic require-
ment for such a special alloy is that it should undergoa phase transformation in the solid state. One type ofalloy satisfying this requirement, already considered,is that which can undergo an order–disorder reac-tion; the hardening accompanying this process (similarin many ways to precipitation-hardening) is termedorder-hardening. However, conditions for this form ofhardening are quite stringent, so that the two prin-cipal hardening methods, commonly used for alloys,are based upon (1) precipitation from a supersaturated
solid solution and (2) eutectoid decomposition.
In engineering applications, strength is, without
doubt, an important parameter. However, it is by nomeans the only important one and usually a materialmust provide a combination of properties. Some duc-tility is generally essential, enabling the material torelievestressconcentrationsbyplasticdeformationandtoresistfracture.Theabilityofmaterialstoresistcrackpropagation and fracture, known generally as tough-ness, will be discussed in this chapter. Fracture cantake many forms; some special forms, such as brit-tle fracture by cleavage, ductile fracture by microvoid
coalescence,creepfracturebytriple-pointcrackingand
fatigue cracking, will be examined.This chapter primarily concerns alloy behaviour,
partly because of the inherent versatility of alloy sys-tems and partly because the research background tomuch of the current understanding of strength, tough-nessandfractureisessentiallymetallurgical.However,itisoftenpossibletoextendthebasicprinciplestonon-metallic materials, particularly in the case of fractureprocesses. This will be apparent later, in Chapter 10,when we describe how theunique transformationchar-acteristics of zirconia can be used to inhibit crackpropagationinabrittleceramicsuchasalumina.Meth-
ods for toughening glasses are described in the same
chapter. In Chapter 11 we consider the strengtheningand toughening effects produced when plastics, met-als and ceramics are reinforced with ﬁlaments to formcomposite materials.
8.2 Strengthening of non-ferrous
alloys by heat-treatment
8.2.1 Precipitation-hardening of Al–Cu alloys
8.2.1.1 Precipitation from supersaturated solid
solution
The basic requirements of a precipitation-hardening
alloy system is that the solid solubility limit shoulddecrease with decreasing temperature as shownin Figure 8.1 for the Al–Cu system. During theprecipitation-hardening heat-treatment procedure thealloy is ﬁrst solution heat-treated at the hightemperature and then rapidly cooled by quenchinginto water or some other cooling medium. The rapidcooling suppresses the separation of the /DC2-phase
so that the alloy exists at the low temperature inan unstable supersaturated state. If, however, after
quenching, the alloy is allowed to ‘age’ for a sufﬁcient
length of time, the second phase precipitates out.This precipitation occurs by a nucleation and growthprocess, ﬂuctuations in solute concentration providing

for the precipitate. However, the size of the precipitatebecomesﬁnerasthetemperatureatwhichprecipitationoccurs is lowered, and extensive hardening of thealloy is associated with a critical dispersion of theprecipitate. If, at any given temperature, ageing is
allowed to proceed too far, coarsening of the particles
occurs (i.e. the small ones tend to redissolve, andthe large ones to grow still larger as discussed inSection 8.2.6) and the numerous ﬁnely dispersed,small particles are gradually replaced by a smaller
number of more widely dispersed, coarser particles.
In this state the alloy becomes softer, and it is thensaid to be in the over-aged condition (see Figure 8.2).
8.2.1.2 Changes in properties accompanying
precipitation
The actual quenching treatment gives rise to small
changes in many of the mechanical and physical prop-
erties of alloys because both solute atoms and point
defects in excess of the equilibrium concentration areretained during the process, and because the quenchitself often produces lattice strains. Perhaps the prop-erty most markedly affected is the electrical resistance
and this is usually considerably increased. In con-
trast, the mechanical properties are affected relativelymuch less.
On ageing, the change in properties in a
quenched material is more marked and, in particular,the mechanical properties often show striking
modiﬁcations. For example, the tensile strength of
Duralumin (i.e. an aluminium–4% copper alloy
containing magnesium, silicon and manganese) may
be raised from 0.21 to 0 .41 GN/m
2while that of
a Cu–2Be alloy may be increased from 0.46 to
Figure 8.1 Al-rich Al–Cu binary diagram showing GP [1],
/DC200and /DC20solvus lines (dotted) .1.23 GN/m2. Thestructure-sensitivepropertiessuchas
hardness, yield stress, etc. are, of course, extremelydependent on the structural distribution of thephases and, consequently, such alloys usually exhibit
softening as the ﬁnely dispersed precipitates coarsen.
A simple theory of precipitation, involving the
nucleation and growth of particles of the expectednew equilibrium phase, leads one to anticipate thatthe alloy would show a single hardening peak, theelectrical resistivity a decrease, and the lattice param-eter an increase (assuming the solute atom is smallerthan the solvent atom) as the solute is removed fromsolution. Such property changes are found in practice,
but only at low supersaturations and high ageing tem-
peratures. At higher supersaturations and lower ageingtemperatures the various property changes are not con-sistent with such a simple picture of precipitation; thealloy may show two or more age-hardening peaks, andthe electrical resistivity and lattice parameter may notchange in the anticipated manner. A hardening pro-cess which takes place in two stages is shown in alu-
minium–copper alloys (Figure 8.2a) where the initial
hardening occurs without any attendant precipitationbeing visible in the light microscope and, moreover,is accompanied by a decrease in conductivity and nochange in lattice parameter. Such behaviour may beaccounted for if precipitation is a process involvingmore than one stage. The initial stage of precipitation,at the lower ageing temperatures, involves a cluster-ing of solute atoms on the solvent lattice sites to form
zones or clusters, coherent with the matrix; the zones
cannot be seen in the light microscope and for this rea-sonthisstagewasatonetimetermedpre-precipitation.At a later stage of the ageing process these clustersbreak away from the matrix lattice to form distinctparticles with their own crystal structure and a deﬁniteinterface. These hypotheses were conﬁrmed originallyby structuralstudiesusingX-ray diffraction techniques
but nowadays the so-called pre-precipitation effects
can be observed directly in the electron microscope.
Even though clustering occurs, the general kinetic
behaviour of the precipitation process is in agreementwith that expected on thermodynamic grounds. FromFigure 8.2 it isevident that the rate of ageing increasesmarkedly with increasing temperature while the peakhardness decreases. Two-stage hardening takes placeat low ageing temperatures and is associated with
high maximum hardness, while single-stage hardening
occurs at higher ageing temperatures, or at lowerageing temperatures for lower solute contents.
Another phenomenon commonly observed in
precipitation-hardeningalloysisreversionorretrogres-sion.Ifanalloyhardenedbyageingatlowtemperatureis subsequently heated to a higher ageing temperatureit softens temporarily, but becomes harder again on
more prolonged heating. This temporary softening, or
reversion of the hardening process, occurs because thevery small nuclei or zones precipitated at the low tem-perature are unstable when raised to the higher ageingtemperature, and consequently they redissolve and the

alloy becomes softer; the temperature above which the
nuclei or zones dissolve is known as the solvus tem-perature; Figure 8.1 shows the solvus temperatures for
GP zones, /DC2
00,/DC20and/DC2. On prolonged ageing at the
higher temperature larger nuclei, characteristic of thattemperature, are formed and the alloy again hardens.
Clearly, the reversion process is reversible, provided
re-hardening at the higher ageing temperature is notallowed to occur.
8.2.1.3 Structural changes during precipitation
Early metallographic investigations showed that the
microstructural changes which occur during the initial
stages of ageing are on too ﬁne a scale to be resolvedby the light microscope, yet it is in these early stagesthatthemostprofoundchangesinpropertiesarefound.
Accordingly, to study the process, it is necessary to
employ the more sensitive and reﬁned techniques ofX-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.
The two basic X-ray techniques, important in study-
ing the regrouping of atoms during the early stagesof ageing, depend on the detection of radiation scat-
tered away from the main diffraction lines or spots
(see Chapter 5). In the ﬁrst technique, developedindependently by Guinier and Preston in 1938, the
Laue method is used. They found that the single-
crystal diffraction pattern of an aluminium–copperalloy developed streaks extending from an aluminium
lattice reﬂection along h100i
Aldirections. This was
attributed to the formation of copper-rich regions of
plate-like shape on f100gplanes of the aluminium
matrix (now called Guinier–Preston zones or GPzones). The net effect of the regrouping is to mod-
ify the scattering power of, and spacing between, very
small groups of f100gplanes throughout the crystal.
However, being only a few atomic planes thick, the
zones produce the diffraction effect typical of a two-dimensional lattice, i.e. the diffraction spot becomes a
diffraction streak. In recent years the Laue method has
been replaced by a single-crystal oscillation technique
employing monochromatic radiation, since interpreta-
tionismadeeasierifthewavelengthoftheX-raysusedis known. The second technique makes use of the phe-
nomenon of scattering of X-rays at small angles (see
Chapter 5). Intense small-angle scattering can often
be observed from age-hardening alloys (as shown in
Figures 8.3 and 8.5) because there is usually a differ-ence in electron density between the precipitated zone
and the surrounding matrix. However, in alloys such
as aluminium–magnesium or aluminium–silicon the
technique is of no value because in these alloys the
small difference in scattering power between the alu-minium and silicon or magnesium atoms, respectively,
is insufﬁcient to give rise to appreciable scattering at
small angles.
With the advent of the electron microscope the age-
ing of aluminiumalloys was one of the ﬁrst subjects tobe investigated with the thin-foil transmission method.
Not only can the detailed structural changes which
occur during the ageing process be followed, but elec-
tron diffraction pictures taken from selected areas of
the specimen while it is still in the microscope enablefurther important information on the structure of the
precipitated phase to be obtained. Moreover, under
some conditions the interaction of moving dislocations
and precipitates can be observed. This naturally leads
to a more complete understanding of the hardeningmechanism.
Both the X-ray and electron-microscope techniques
show that in virtually all age-hardening systems the
initial precipitate is not the same structure as the equi-
librium phase. Instead, an ageing sequence: zones !
intermediate precipitates !equilibrium precipitate is
followed. This sequence occurs because the equilib-
rium precipitate is incoherent with the matrix, whereas
the transition structures are either fully coherent, as in
the case of zones, or at least partially coherent. Then,because of the importance of the surface energy and
strain energy of the precipitate to the precipitation pro-
cess, the system follows such a sequence in order to
have the lowest free energy in all stages of precipita-
tion. The surface energy of the precipitates dominatesthe processof nucleationwhenthe interfacialenergy is
large (i.e. whenthereisadiscontinuityinatomic struc-
ture, somewhat like a grain boundary, at the interface
between the nucleus and the matrix), so that for the
incoherent type of precipitate the nuclei must exceed a

certain minimum size before they can nucleate a new
phase. To avoid such a slow mode of precipitationa coherent type of precipitate is formed instead, for
which the size effect is relatively unimportant. The
condition for coherence usually requires the precipi-
tate to strain its equilibrium lattice to ﬁt that of the
matrix, or to adopt a metastable lattice. However, in
spite of both a higher volume free energy and a higher
strain energy, the transition structure is more stable in
the early stages of precipitation because of its lower
interfacial energy.
When the precipitate does become incoherent the
alloy will, nevertheless, tend to reduce its surface
energy as much as possible, by arranging the orienta-
tionrelationshipbetweenthematrixandtheprecipitate
sothatthecrystalplaneswhichareparallelto,andsep-
arated by, the bounding surface have similar atomic
spacings. Clearly, for these habit planes, as they are
called, the better the crystallographic match, the lesswill be the distortion at the interface and the lower
the surface energy. This principle governs the precip-
itation of many alloy phases, as shown by the fre-
quent occurrence of the Widmanst ¨atten structure, i.e.
plate-shaped precipitates lying along prominent crys-
tallographic planes of the matrix. Most precipitates are
plate-shaped because the strain energy factor is least
for this form.
Theexistenceofaprecipitationsequenceisre ﬂected
in the ageing curves and, as we have seen in
Figure 8.2, often leads to two stages of hardening.
The zones, by de ﬁnition, are coherent with the
matrix, and as they form the alloy becomes harder.
The intermediate precipitate may be coherent with
the matrix, in which case a further increase of
hardnessoccurs,oronlypartiallycoherent,wheneither
hardening or softening may result. The equilibriumprecipitateis incoherentand itsformation always leads
to softening. These features are best illustrated by a
consideration of some actual age-hardening systems.Precipitation reactions occur in a wide variety
of alloy systems as shown in Table 8.1. Thealuminium –copper alloy system exhibits the greatest
number of intermediate stages in its precipitation
process, and consequently is probably the most
widely studied. When the copper content is high and
the ageing temperature low, the sequence of stages
followed is GP [1], GP [2], /DC2
0and /DC2⊿CuAl2/triangleleft.O n
ageing at higher temperatures, however, one or more
of these intermediate stages may be omitted and,
as shown in Figure 8.2, corresponding differences
in the hardness curves can be detected. The early
stages of ageing are due to GP [1] zones, which
are interpreted as plate-like clusters of copper atoms
segregatedonto f100gplanesofthealuminiummatrix.

GP [2] is best described as a coherent intermediate
precipitate rather than a zone, since it has a de ﬁ-
nite crystal structure; for this reason the symbol /DC200
is often preferred. These precipitates, usually of max-
imum thickness 10 nm and up to 150 nm diameter,
have a tetragonal structure which ﬁts perfectly with
the aluminium unit cell in the aandbdirections but
not in the c. The structure postulated has a central
plane which consists of 100% copper atoms, the next
two planes a mixture of copper and aluminium and
the other two basal planes of pure aluminium, giv-
ing an overall composition of CuAl 2. Because of their
size, /DC200precipitates are easily observed in the elec-
tron microscope, and because of the ordered arrange-ments of copper and aluminium atoms within the
structure, their presence gives rise to intensity max-
ima on the diffraction streaks in an X-ray photograph.

Since the cparameter 0.78 nm differs from that of
aluminium 0.404 nm the aluminium planes parallel tothe plate are distorted by elastic coherency strains.Moreover, the precipitate grows with the cdirection
normal to the plane of the plate, so that the strain
ﬁelds become larger as it grows and at peak hard-
ness extend from one precipitate particle to the next(see Figure 8.4a). The direct observation of coherencystrains con ﬁrms the theories of hardening based on the
development of an elastically strained matrix (see next
section).
The transition structure /DC2
0is tetragonal; the true
unit cell dimensions are aD0.404 and cD0.58 nm
and the axes are parallel to h100iAldirections. The
strains around the /DC20plates can be relieved, however,
by the formation of a stable dislocation loop around
the precipitate and such a loop has been observed
around small /DC20plates in the electron microscope as
shown in Figure 8.4b. The long-range strain ﬁelds
of the precipitate and its dislocation largely cancel.Consequently,itiseasierforglidedislocationstomovethroughthelatticeofthealloycontaininganincoherent

The /DC2structure is also tetragonal, with aD0.606

incoherent with the matrix and its formation always
leads to softening, since coherency strains disap-
pear.
8.2.2 Precipitation-hardening of Al–Ag alloys
Investigations using X-ray diffraction and electronmicroscopy have shown the existence of three dis-tinct stages in the age-hardening process, which maybe summarized: silver-rich clusters !intermediatehexagonal /CR
0!equilibrium hexagonal /CR. The hard-
ening is associated with the ﬁrst two stages in which
the precipitate is coherent and partially coherent with
the matrix, respectively.
During the quench and in the early stages of ageing,

in Figure 8.5a, has a diffuse ring surrounding the trace
of the direct beam. The absence of intensity in thecentre of the ring (i.e. at ⊿000/triangleleft) is attributed to the
fact that clustering takes place so rapidly that there isleft a shell-like region surrounding each cluster which
islowinsilvercontent.Onageing,theclustersgrowin
size and decrease in number, and this is characterizedbytheX-raypatternshowingagradualdecreaseinringdiameter. The concentration and size of clusters can be
followed very accurately by measuring the intensity
distribution across the ring as a function of ageingtime.Thisintensitymayberepresented(seeChapter 5)by an equation of the form

and for values of εgreater than that corresponding
to the maximum intensity, the contribution of the
second term, which represents the denuded region
surrounding the cluster, can be neglected. Figure 8.5bshows the variation in the X-ray intensity, scattered atsmall angles (SAS) with cluster growth, on ageing an
aluminium –silver alloy at 120
°C. An analysis of this
intensity distribution, using equation (8.1), indicatesthat the size of the zones increases from 2 to 5 nm injust a few hours at 120
°C. These zones may, of course,
be seen in the electron microscope and Figure 8.6a

in an aluminium –silver alloy aged 5 hours at 160 °C;
the diameter of the zones is about 10 nm in goodagreement with that deduced by X-ray analysis. Thezone shape is dependent upon the relative diameters
of solute and solvent atoms. Thus, solute atoms such
as silver and zinc which have atomic sizes similar toaluminium give rise to spherical zones, whereas soluteatoms such as copper which have a high mis ﬁti nt h e
solvent lattice form plate-like zones.

structure is hexagonal and, consequently, the precipi-
tatesareeasilyrecognizableintheelectronmicroscope
by the stacking fault contrast within them, as shown in
Figure 8.6b. Clearly, these precipitates are never fully
coherentwiththematrix,but,nevertheless,inthisalloy
system, wherethe zonesare sphericalandhavelittleor
no coherency strain associated with them, and where
nocoherent intermediateprecipitateisformed, thepar-tially coherent /CR
0precipitates do provide a greater
resistance to dislocation movement than zones and a
second stage of hardening results.
The same principles apply to the constitution-
ally more complex ternary and quaternary alloys
as to the binary alloys. Spherical zones are found
in aluminium –magnesium –zinc alloys as in alu-
minium–zinc, although the magnesium atom is some
12% larger than the aluminium atom. The intermedi-
ate precipitate forms on the f111gAlplanes, and is
partially coherent with the matrix with little or no
strainﬁeld associated with it. Hence, the strength of
the alloy is due purely to dispersion hardening, and
the alloy softens as the precipitate becomes coarser.In nickel-based alloys the hardening phase is the
ordered /CR
0-Ni3Al; this /CR0is an equilibrium phase in
the Ni–Al and Ni –Cr–Al systems and a metastable
phase in Ni –Ti and Ni –Cr–Ti. These systems form
the basis of the ‘superalloys ’(see Chapter 9) which
owe their properties to the close matching of the /CR0
and the fcc matrix. The two phases have very simi-
lar lattice parameters ( ⊿/lessorsimilar0.25%/triangleleft, depending on com-
position) and the coherency (interfacial energy /CR1³
10–20 mJ/m2) confers a very low coarsening rate on
the precipitate so that the alloy overages extremely
slowly even at 0 .7Tm.

8.2.3 Mechanisms of precipitation-hardening
8.2.3.1 The signi ﬁcance of particle
deformability
The strength of an age-hardening alloy is governed by
the interaction of moving dislocations and precipitates.The obstacles in precipitation-hardening alloys whichhinder the motion of dislocations may be either (1) thestrains around GP zones, (2) the zones or precipitates
themselves, or both. Clearly, if it is the zones them-
selves which are important, it will be necessary forthe moving dislocations either to cut through them orgo round them. Thus, merely from elementary reason-ing, it would appear that there are at least three causesof hardening, namely: (1) coherency strain hardening,(2) chemical hardening, i.e. when the dislocation cutsthroughtheprecipitate,or(3) dispersionhardening,i.e.whenthedislocationgoesroundorovertheprecipitate.
The relative contributions will depend on the
particular alloy system but, generally, there is a criticaldispersionatwhichthestrengtheningisamaximum,asshown in Figure 8.7. In the small-particle regime theprecipitates, or particles, are coherent and deformable
as the dislocations cut through them, while in the
larger-particle regime the particles are incoherentand non-deformable as the dislocations bypass them.For deformable particles, when the dislocations passthrough the particle, the intrinsic properties of theparticle are of importance and alloy strength variesonly weakly with particle size. For non-deformableparticles, when the dislocations bypass the particles,
the alloy strength is independent of the particleproperties but is strongly dependent on particle sizeand dispersion strength decreasing as particle size ordispersion increases. The transition from deformableto non-deformable particle-controlled deformation is
readily recognized by the change in microstructure,
since the ‘laminar’undisturbeddislocation ﬂow for the
formercontrastswiththeturbulentplastic ﬂowfornon-
deformable particles. The latter leads to the productionofahighdensityofdislocationloops,dipolesandotherdebris which results in a high rate of work-hardening.This high rate of work-hardening is a distinguishing
feature of all dispersion-hardened systems.
8.2.3.2 Coherency strain-hardening
The precipitation of particles having a slight mis ﬁti n
the matrix gives rise to stress ﬁelds which hinder the
movement of gliding dislocations. For the dislocationstopassthroughtheregionsofinternalstresstheapplied
stress must be at least equal to the average internal
stress, and for spherical particles this is given by
/FSD2/SYNεf (8.2)
where /SYNis the shear modulus, εis the mis ﬁto ft h e
particle and fis the volume fraction of precipitate.
This suggestion alone, however, cannot account for
the critical size of dispersion of a precipitate at which
the hardening is a maximum, since equation (8.2) isindependent of L, the distance between particles. To
explain this, Mott and Nabarro consider the extent towhich a dislocation can bow round a particle underthe action of a stress /FS. Like the bowing stress of a
Frank–Read source this is given by
rD˛/SYNb//FS (8.3)
where ris the radius of curvature to which the dislo-
cation is bent which is related to the particle spacing.Hence, in the hardest age-hardened alloys where the
Figure 8.7 Variation of strength with particle size, deﬁning
the deformable and non-deformable particle regimes .
266Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
yield strength is about /SYN/100, the dislocation can bend
to a radius of curvature of about 100 atomic spac-ings, and since the distance between particles is of thesame order it would appear that the dislocation canavoid the obstacles and take a form like that shown inFigure 8.8a. With a dislocation line taking up such a
conﬁguration, in order to produce glide, each section
of the dislocation line has to be taken over the adverseregion of internal stress without any help from othersections of the line — the alloy is then hard. If theprecipitate is dispersed on too ﬁne a scale (e.g. when
the alloy has been freshly quenched or lightly aged)
the dislocation is unable or bend sufﬁciently to lieentirely in the regions of low internal stress. As aresult, the internal stresses acting on the dislocationline largely cancel and the force resisting its move-ment is small — the alloy then appears soft. When
the dispersion is on a coarse scale, the dislocation line
is able to move between the particles, as shown inFigure 8.8b, and the hardening is again small.
For coherency strain hardening the ﬂow stress
depends on the ability of the dislocation to bend andthus experience more regions of adverse stress than of
aiding stress. The ﬂow stress therefore depends on the
treatment of averaging the stress, and recent attemptsseparate the behaviour of small and large coherent par-ticles. For small coherent particles the ﬂow stress isgiven by
/FSD4.1/SYNε

ple arithmetic average of equation (8.2). For largecoherent particles

8.2.3.3 Chemical hardening
When a dislocation actually passes through a zone
as shown in Figure 8.9 a change in the number of
solvent–solute near-neighbours occurs across the slip
plane. This tends to reverse the process of cluster-ing and, hence, additional work must be done by theapplied stress to bring this about. This process, knownas chemical hardening, provides a short-range interac-
tion between dislocations and precipitates and arises
from three possible causes: (1) the energy requiredto create an additional particle/matrix interface withenergy /CR

8.2.3.4 Dispersion-hardening
In dispersion-hardening it is assumed that the precipi-
tates do not deform with the matrix and that the yieldstress is the stress necessary to expand a loop of dislo-
cation between the precipitates. This will be given by

stages of precipitation when the precipitate becomes
incoherent and the misﬁt strains disappear. A mov-ing dislocation is then able to bypass the obstacles, as
shown in Figure 8.8b, by moving in the clean pieces
of crystal between the precipitated particles. The yield
stress decreases as the distance between the obsta-
cles increases in the over-aged condition. However,even when the dispersion of the precipitate is coarse
a greater applied stress is necessary to force a dislo-
cation past the obstacles than would be the case if the

strengthening remains but the majority of the strength-ening arises from the dislocation debris left around theparticles giving rise to high work-hardening.
8.2.3.5 Hardening mechanisms in Al–Cu alloys
The actual hardening mechanism which operates in agiven alloy will depend on several factors, such asthe type of particle precipitated (e.g. whether zone,intermediate precipitate or stable phase), the mag-nitude of the strain and the testing temperature. Inthe earlier stages of ageing (i.e. before over-ageing)the coherent zones are cut by dislocations movingthrough the matrix and hence both coherency strainhardening and chemical hardening will be important,e.g. in such alloys as aluminium–copper, copper-beryllium and iron–vanadium–carbon. In alloys suchas aluminium–silver and aluminium–zinc, however,the zones possess no strain ﬁeld, so that chemicalhardening will be the most important contribution. Inthe important high-temperature creep-resistant nickelalloys the precipitate is of the Ni
3Al form which has
a low particle/matrix misﬁt and hence chemical hard-ening due to dislocations cutting the particles is againpredominant. To illustrate that more than one mech-anism of hardening is in operation in a given alloysystem, let us examine the mechanical behaviour ofan aluminium–copper alloy in more detail.
Figure 8.10 shows the deformation characteristics
of single crystals of an aluminium–copper (nominally4%) alloy in various structural states. The curves were
obtained by testing crystals of approximately the sameorientation, but the stress–strain curves from crystalscontaining GP [1] and GP [2] zones are quite differentfrom those for crystals containing /DC2
0or/DC2precipitates.
When the crystals contain either GP [1] or GP [2]
zones,thestress–straincurvesareverysimilartothoseof pure aluminium crystals, except that there is a two-or threefold increase in the yield stress. In contrast,when the crystals contain either /DC2
0or/DC2precipitates the
yield stress is less than for crystals containing zones,but the initial rate of work-hardening is extremely
rapid. In fact, the stress–strain curves bear no simi-
larity to those of a pure aluminium crystal. It is alsoobserved that when /DC2
0or/DC2is present as a precipitate,
deformation does not take place on a single slip sys-tem but on several systems; the crystal then deforms,morenearlyasapolycrystaldoesandtheX-raypatterndevelops extensive asterism. These factors are consis-
tent with the high rate of work-hardening observed in
crystals containing /DC2
0or/DC2precipitates.
The separation of the precipitates cutting any slip
plane can be deduced from both X-ray and electron-microscope observations. For the crystals, relating toFigure 8.10, containing GP [1] zones this value is15 nmandforGP [2]zonesitis25 nm.Itthenfollowsfrom equation (8.3) that to avoid these precipitates the
dislocations would have to bow to a radius of cur-
vature of about 10 nm. To do this requires a stressseveral times greater than theobserved ﬂow stressand,
Figure 8.10 Stress–strain curves from single crystals of aluminium–4% copper containing GP [1] zones, GP [2], zones,
/DC20-precipitates and /DC2-precipitates respectively (after Fine, Bryne and Kelly) .
268Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
in consequence, it must be assumed that the disloca-
tions are forced through the zones. Furthermore, if wesubstitute the observed values of the ﬂow stress in the
relation /SYNb//FS DL, it will be evident that the bowing
mechanism is unlikely to operate unless the particlesare about 60 nm apart. This is conﬁrmed by electron-
microscope observations which show that dislocations
pass through GP zones and coherent precipitates, but
bypass non-coherent particles. Once a dislocation has
cut through a zone, however, the path for subsequentdislocations on the same slip plane will be easier,
so that the work-hardening rate of crystals containing
zones should be low, as shown in Figure 8.10. The
straight, well-deﬁned slip bands observed on the sur-
faces of crystals containing GP [1] zones also supportthis interpretation.
If the zones possess no strain ﬁeld, as in alu-
minium–silver or aluminium-zinc alloys, the ﬂowstress would be entirely governed by the chemical
hardening effect. However, the zones in aluminium
copper alloys do possess strain ﬁelds, as shown in
Figure 8.4, and, consequently, the stresses around a
zone will also affect the ﬂow stress. Each dislocationwill be subjected to the stresses due to a zone at a
small distance from the zone.
It will be remembered from Chapter 7 that temper-
ature profoundly affects the ﬂow stress if the barrier
which the dislocations have to overcome is of a short-range nature. For thisreason, the ﬂow stressof crystals
containing GP [1] zones will have a larger dependence
on temperature than that of those containing GP [2]zones. Thus, while it is generally supposed that the
strengthening effect of GP [2] zones is greater than
that of GP [1], and this is true at normal tempera-
tures (see Figure 8.10), at very low temperatures it
is probable that GP [1] zones will have the greaterstrengthening effect due to the short-range interactions
between zones and dislocations.
The/DC2
0and/DC2precipitates are incoherent and do not
deform with the matrix, so that the critical resolved
shear stress is the stress necessary to expand a loopof dislocation between them. This corresponds to theover-aged condition and the hardening to dispersion-
hardening. The separation of the /DC2particles is greater
than that of the /DC2
0, being somewhat greater than 1 µm
and the initial ﬂow stress is very low. In both cases,however, the subsequent rate of hardening is high
because, as suggested by Fisher, Hart and Pry, the
gliding dislocation interacts with the dislocation loopsin the vicinity of the particles (see Figure 8.8b). Thestress–strain curves show, however, that the rate ofwork-hardening falls to a low value after a few per
cent strain, and these authors attribute the maximum
in the strain-hardening curve to the shearing of theparticles. This process is not observed in crystals con-taining /DC2precipitates at room temperature and, con-
sequently, it seems more likely that the particles will
be avoided by cross-slip. If this is so, prismatic loops
of dislocation will be formed at the particles, by themechanism shown in Figure 8.11, and these will giveapproximately the same mean internal stress as that
calculated byFisher, Hartand Pry, buta reduced stress
on the particle. The maximum in the work-hardeningcurve would then correspond to the stress necessary toexpand these loops; this stress will be of the order of

8.2.4 Vacancies and precipitation
Itisclearthatbecauseprecipitationiscontrolledbytherate of atomic migration in the alloy, temperature willhave a pronounced effect on the process. Moreover,
since precipitation is a thermally activated process,
other variablessuch as time of annealing, composition,grain size and prior cold work are also important.However, the basic treatment of age-hardening alloysis solution treatment followed by quenching, and the
introduction of vacancies by the latter process must
play an important role in the kinetic behaviour.
It has been recognized that near room temperature,
zone formation in alloys such as aluminium–copperand aluminium–silver occurs at a rate many orders
of magnitude greater than that calculated from the
Figure 8.11 Cross-slip of (a) edge and (b) screw dislocation over a particle producing prismatic loops in the process .
Strengthening and toughening 269
diffusion coefﬁcient of the solute atoms. In alu-
minium–copper, for example, the formation of zonesis already apparent after only a few minutes at room
temperature, and is complete after an hour or two,
so that the copper atoms must therefore have moved
through several atomic spacings in that time. This cor-
responds to an apparent diffusion coefﬁcient of copper
in aluminium of about 10
/NUL20–10/NUL22m2s/NUL1,w h i c hi s
many orders of magnitude faster than the value of
5ð10/NUL29m2s/NUL1obtained by extrapolation of high-
temperature data. Many workers have attributed this
enhanced diffusion to the excess vacancies retainedduringthequenchingtreatment.Thus,sincetheexpres-
sionfor the diffusioncoefﬁcient at a given temperature
contains a factor proportional to the concentration of
vacanciesatthattemperature, ifthesamplecontainsan
abnormally large vacancy concentration then the diffu-sion coefﬁcient should be increased by the ratio c
Q/co,
where cQisthequenched-invacancyconcentrationand
cois the equilibrium concentration. The observed clus-
tering rate can be accounted for if the concentration of
vacancies retained is about 10/NUL3–10/NUL4.
The observation of loops by transmission electron
microscopy allows an estimate of the number of
excess vacancies to be made, and in all cases of
rapid quenching the vacancy concentration in these
alloys is somewhat greater than 10/NUL4, in agreement
with the predictions outlined above. Clearly, as
the excess vacancies are removed, the amount of
enhanced diffusion diminishes, which agrees with the
observations that the isothermal rate of clustering
decreases continuously with increasing time. In fact,
it is observed that Ddecreases rapidly at ﬁrst and
then remains at a value well above the equilibriumvalue for months at room temperature; the process is
therefore separated into what is called the fast and
slow reactions. A mechanism proposed to explain the
slow reaction is that some of the vacancies quenched-
in are trapped temporarily and then released slowly.
Measurements show that the activation energy in the
fast reaction ( ³0.5 eV) is smaller than in the slow
reaction( ³1 eV)byanamountwhichcanbeattributed
to the binding energy between vacancies and trapping
sites. These traps are very likely small dislocation
loops or voids formed by the clustering of vacancies.
The equilibrium matrix vacancy concentration wouldthen be greater than that for a well-annealed crystal by
a factor exp [ /CR/DEL/rkT], where /CRis the surface energy,
/DELthe atomic volume and rthe radius of the defect
(see Chapter 4). The experimental diffusion rate can
be accounted for if r³2 nm, which is much smaller

The activation energy for the slow reaction would thenbeE
D/NUL⊿/CR/DEL/r/triangleleftor approximately 1 eV for r³2n m .
Other factors known to affect the kinetics of the
early stages of ageing (e.g. altering the quenching rate,
interrupted quenching and cold work) may also be
rationalized on the basis that these processes lead to
different concentrations of excess vacancies. In gen-
eral, cold working the alloy prior to ageing causesa decrease in the rate of formation of zones, which
must mean that the dislocations introduced by cold
work are more effective as vacancy sinks than as
vacancy sources. Cold working or rapid quenching
therefore have opposing effects on the formation ofzones. Vacancies are also important in other aspects
of precipitation-hardening. For example, the excess
vacancies, by condensing to form a high density of
dislocation loops, can provide nucleation sites for
intermediate precipitates. This leads to the interest-ing observation in aluminium–copper alloys that cold
working or rapid quenching, by producing dislocations
for nucleation sites, have the same effect on the for-
mation of the /DC2
0phase but, as we have seen above, the
opposite effect on zone formation. It is also interestingto note that screw dislocations, which are not normally
favourable sites for nucleation, can also become sites
for preferential precipitation when they have climbed
into helical dislocations by absorbing vacancies, and
have thus become mainly of edge character. The longarrays of /DC2
0phase observed in aluminium–copper
alloys, shown in Figure 8.4c, have probably formed
on helices in this way. In some of these alloys, defects
containing stacking faults are observed, in addition to
the dislocation loops and helices, and examples havebeen found where such defects nucleate an interme-
diate precipitate having a hexagonal structure. In alu-
minium–silver alloys it is also found that the helical
dislocationsintroducedbyquenchingabsorbsilverand
degenerate into long narrow stacking faults on f111g
planes; these stacking-fault defects then act as nuclei
for the hexagonal /CR
0precipitate.
Many commercial alloys depend critically on
the interrelation between vacancies, dislocations and
solute atoms and it is found that trace impuritiessigniﬁcantly modify the precipitation process. Thus
trace elements which interact strongly with vacancies
inhibit zone formation, e.g. Cd, In, Sn prevent zone
formation in slowly quenched Al–Cu alloys for up
to 200 days at 30
°C. This delays the age-hardening
processatroomtemperaturewhichgivesmoretimefor
mechanically fabricating the quenched alloy before it
gets too hard, thus avoiding the need for refrigeration.
On the other hand, Cd increases the density of /DC20
precipitate by increasing the density of vacancy loops
and heliceswhich act as nucleifor precipitationand by
segregatingtothematrix- /DC20interfacestherebyreducing
the interfacial energy.
Since grain boundaries absorb vacancies in many
alloys there is a grain boundary zone relatively freefrom precipitation. The Al–Zn–Mg alloy is one com-
mercial alloy which suffers grain boundary weakness
but it is found that trace additions of Ag have a ben-
eﬁcial effect in reﬁning the precipitate structure and
removing the precipitate free grain boundary zone.Here it appears that Ag atoms stabilize vacancy clus-
ters near the grain boundary and also increase the
stability of the GP zone thereby raising the GP zone
solvus temperature. Similarly, in the ‘Concorde’ alloy,

ated in the presence of Si rather than heterogeneouslynucleated at dislocations, and the precipitate growsdirectly from zones, giving rise to improved and moreuniform properties.
Apart from speeding up the kinetics of ageing,
and providing dislocations nucleation sites, vacan-
cies may play a structural role when they precipi-
tate cooperatively with solute atoms to facilitate thebasic atomic arrangements required for transformingthe parent crystal structure to that of the productphase. In essence, the process involves the system-aticincorporationofexcessvacancies,producedbytheinitial quench or during subsequent dislocation loopannealing, in a precipitate zone or plate to change the
atomic stacking. A simple example of /DC2
0formation in
Al–Cu is shown schematically in Figure 8.12. Ideally,the structure of the /DC2
00phase in Al–Cu consists of
layers of copper on f100gseparated by three lay-
ers of aluminium atoms. If a next-nearest neighbourlayer of aluminium atoms from the copper layer isremoved by condensing a vacancy loop, an embryonic/DC2
0unit cell with Al in the correct AAA ...stacking
sequence is formed (Figure 8.12b). Formation of the
ﬁnal CuAl 2/DC20ﬂuorite structure requires only shufﬂing
half of the copper atoms into the newly created next-nearest neighbour space and concurrent relaxation ofthe Al atoms to the correct /DC2
0interplanar distances
(Figure 8.12c).
The structural incorporation of vacancies in a pre-
cipitate is a non-conservative process since atomicsites are eliminated. There exist equivalent conserva-
tive processes in which the new precipitate structure is
created from the old by the nucleation and expansionof partial dislocation loops with predominantly shearcharacter.Thus,forexample,the BABAB f100gplane
stacking sequence of the fcc structure can be changed
toBAABA by the propagation of an a/2h100ishear
loop in the f100gplane, or to BAAAB by the propa-
gation of a pair of a/2h100ipartials of opposite sign
on adjacent planes. Again, the AAAstacking resulting
from the double shear is precisely that required for theembryonic formation of the ﬂuorite structure from thefcc lattice.
In visualizing the role of lattice defects in the nucle-
ation and growth of plate-shaped precipitates, a simple
analogy with Frank and Shockley partial dislocationloopsisuseful.IntheformationofaFrankloop,alayerof hcp material is created from the fcc lattice by the(non-conservative) condensation of a layer of vacan-cies in f111g. Exactly the same structure is formed by

‘precipitate’ is produced bounded by an a/3h111idis-
location, and in the latter a coherent one bounded byana/6h112i. Continued growth of precipitate plates

The growth of a second-phase particle with a dis-
parate size or crystal structure relative to the matrix
is controlled by two overriding principles–the accom-modation of the volume and shape change, and theoptimized use of the available deformation mecha-nisms. In general, volumetric transformation strainsare accommodated by vacancy or interstitial conden-sation, or prismatic dislocation loop punching, whiledeviatoric strains are relieved by shear loop prop-
agation. An example is shown in Figure 8.13. The

8.2.5 Duplex ageing
In non-ferrous heat-treatment there is considerable
interest in double (or duplex) ageing treatments to
obtain the best microstructure consistent with opti-mum properties. It is now realized that it is unlikelythat the optimum properties will be produced in alloysof the precipitation-hardening type by a single quenchand ageing treatment. For example, while the interiorof grains may develop an acceptable precipitate sizeand density, in the neighbourhood of efﬁcient vacancysinks, such as grain boundaries, a precipitate-free zone(PFZ) is formed which is often associated with over-ageing in the boundary itself. This heterogeneousstructure gives rise to poor properties, particularlyunder stress corrosion conditions.
Duplex ageing treatments have been used to over-
come this difﬁculty. In Al–Zn–Mg, for example, itwas found that storage at room temperature beforeheating to the ageing temperature leads to the forma-tion of ﬁner precipitate structure and better properties.Thisisjustonespecialexampleoftwo-stepormultipleageing treatments which have commercial advantagesand have been found to be applicable to several alloys.
Duplex ageing gives better competitive mechanical
properties in Al-alloys (e.g. Al–Zn–Mg alloys) withmuch enhanced corrosion resistance since the grainboundary zone is removed. It is possible to obtain
strengths of 267–308 MN/m
2in Mg–Zn–Mn alloyswhich have very good strength/weight ratio applica-
tions, and nickel alloys also develop better properties
with multiple ageing treatments.
The basic idea of all heat-treatments is to ‘seed’
a uniform distribution of stable nuclei at the lowtemperature which can then be grown to optimumsize at the higher temperature. In most alloys, there isa critical temperature T
cabove which homogeneous
nucleation of precipitate does not take place, andin some instances has been identiﬁed with the GPzone solvus. On ageing above T
cthere is a certain
critical zone size above which the zones are able toact as nuclei for precipitates and below which thezones dissolve.
In general, the ageing behaviour of Al–Zn–Mg
alloys can be divided into three classes which can bedeﬁned by the temperature ranges involved:
1. Alloys quenched and aged above the GP zone
solvus (i.e. the temperature above which the zonesdissolve, which is above ¾155
°C in a typical
Al–Zn–Mg alloy). Then, since no GP zones are
ever formed during heat treatment, there are noeasy nuclei for subsequent precipitation and a verycoarse dispersion of precipitates results with nucle-ation principally on dislocations.
2. Alloys quenched and aged below the GP zone
solvus. GP zones form continuously and grow toa size at which they are able to transform to pre-cipitates. The transformation will occur rather moreslowly in the grain boundary regions due to thelower vacancy concentration there but since age-ing will always be below the GP zone solvus, noPFZ is formed other than a very small ( ¾30 nm)
solute-denuded zone due to precipitation in thegrain boundary.
3. Alloys quenched below the GP zone solvus and
aged above it (e.g. quenched to room temperatureandagedat180
°CforAl–Zn–Mg).Thisisthemost
common practical situation. The ﬁnal dispersion ofprecipitatesand the PFZ widthare controlledby thenucleation treatment below 155
°C where GP zone
size distribution is determined. A long nucleationtreatment gives a ﬁne dispersion of precipitates anda narrow PFZ.
It is possible to stabilize GP zones by addition of
trace elements. These have the same effect as raisingT
c, so that alloys are effectively aged below Tc.O n e
example is Ag to Al–Zn–Mg which raises Tcfrom
155°C to 185 °C, another is Si to Al–Cu–Mg, another
Cu to Al–Mg–Si and yet another Cd or Sn to Al–Cualloys. It is then possible to get uniform distributionand optimum properties by single ageing, and is anexample of achieving by chemistry what can similarlybe done with physics during multiple ageing. Whetherit is best to alter the chemistry or to change the physicsfor a given alloy usually depends on other factors (e.g.economics).

8.2.6 Particle-coarsening
With continued ageing at a given temperature, there is
a tendency for the small particles to dissolve and the
resultant solute to precipitate on larger particles caus-ing them to grow, thereby lowering the total interfacialenergy. This process is termed particle-coarsening, orsometimesOstwaldripening.Thedrivingforceforpar-ticlegrowthisthedifferencebetweentheconcentrationof solute ⊿S

To estimate the coarsening rate of a particle it is
necessary to consider the rate-controlling process for

tems the agreement between theory and experiment is
generally less precise, although generally the cube of

Because of the ease of nucleation, particles may
tend to concentrate on grain boundaries, and hence

where the constant Kincludes the solute diffusion

the grain boundary than in the matrix and this leads
to a less strong dependence on temperature for the
growth of grain boundary precipitates. For this reasontheir preferential growth is likely to be predominant
only at relatively low temperature.
8.2.7 Spinodal decomposition
For any alloy composition where the free energy curve
has a negative curvature, i.e. ⊿d2G/dc2/triangleleft<0, small
ﬂuctuations in composition that produce A-rich and
B-rich regions will bring about a lowering of the total
free energy. At a given temperature the alloy must lie
between two points of inﬂection (where d2G/dc2D0)
and the locus of these points at different temperatures
is depicted on the phase diagram by the chemical
spinodal line (see Figure 8.16).

5–10 nm is favoured, since shorter /NAK’s have too sharp
a concentration gradient and longer /NAK’s have too large
a diffusion distance. For large misﬁt values, a largeundercooling is required to overcome the strain energy
effect. In cubic crystals, Eis usually smaller along
h100idirections and the high strain energy is accom-
modated more easily in the elastically soft directions,
with composition modulations localized along this
direction.
Spinodal decompositions have now been studied in
a number of systems such as Cu–Ni–Fe, Cu–Ni–Si,
Ni–12Ti, Cu–5Ti exhibiting ‘side-bands’ in X-ray
small-angle scattering, satellite spots in electrondiffraction patterns and characteristic modulation ofstructure along h100iin electron micrographs. Many
of the alloys produced by splat cooling might be
expected to exhibit spinodal decomposition, and it hasbeen suggested that in some alloy systems GP zones
form in this way at high supersaturations, becausethe GP zone solvus (see Figure 8.1) gives rise to ametastable coherent miscibility gap.
The spinodally decomposed microstructure is
believed to have unusually good mechanical stabilityunder fatigue conditions.
8.3 Strengthening of steels by
heat-treatment
8.3.1 Time–temperature–transformation
diagrams
Eutectoid decomposition occurs in both ferrous
(e.g. iron–carbon) and non-ferrous (e.g. cop-per–aluminium, copper–tin) alloy systems, but it is
of particular importance industrially in governing the
hardening of steels. In the iron–carbon system (seeFigure 3.18) the /CR-phase, austenite, which is a solid
solution of carbon in fcc iron, decomposes on cool-ing to give a structure known as pearlite, composedof alternate lamellae of cementite ⊿Fe
3C/triangleleftand ferrite.
However, when the cooling conditions are such thatthe alloy structure is far removed from equilibrium, analternative transformation may occur. Thus, on very
rapid cooling, a metastable phase called martensite,
which is a supersaturated solid solution of carbon inferrite,isproduced.Themicrostructureofsuchatrans-formed steel is not homogeneous but consists of plate-like needles of martensite embedded in a matrix ofthe parent austenite. Apart from martensite, anotherstructure known as bainite may also be formed ifthe formation of pearlite is avoided by cooling theaustenite rapidly through the temperature range above
550
°C, and then holding the steel at some temperature
between 250 °C and 550 °C. A bainitic structure con-
sists of platelike grains of ferrite, somewhat like theplates of martensite, inside which carbide particles canbe seen.
The structure produced when austenite is allowed
to transform isothermally at a given temperature canbe conveniently represented by a diagram of the typeshown in Figure 8.18, which plots the time necessaryat a given temperature to transform austenite of eutec-
toidcompositiontooneofthethreestructures:pearlite,
bainite or martensite. Such a diagram, made up fromthe results of a series of isothermal-decompositionexperiments, is called a TTT curve, since it relates thetransformation product to the time at a given tempera-ture. It willbe evidentfrom such a diagram thata widevariety of structurescan be obtainedfrom the austenitedecomposition of a particular steel; the structure mayrange from 100% coarse pearlite, when the steel will
be soft and ductile, to fully martensitic, when the steel
will be hard and brittle. It is because this wide rangeof properties can be produced by the transformation ofa steel that it remains a major constructional materialfor engineering purposes.
Strengthening and toughening 275
Figure 8.18 TTT curves for (a) eutectoid, (b) hypo-eutectoid and (c) low alloy (e.g. Ni/Cr/Mo) steels (after ASM Metals
Handbook) .
From the TTT curve it can be seen that just below
the critical temperature, A1, the rate of transforma-
tion is slow even though the atomic mobility must
be high in this temperature range. This is because any
phase change involving nucleation and growth (e.g.
the pearlite transformation) is faced with nucleation
difﬁculties, which arise from the necessary surface andstrainenergycontributionstothenucleus.Ofcourse,as
the transformation temperature approaches the temper-
ature corresponding to the knee of the curve, the trans-formation rate increases. The slowness of the transfor-
mation below the knee of the TTT curve, when bainite
is formed, is also readily understood, since atomicmigration is slow at these lower temperatures andthe bainite transformation depends on diffusion. The
lower part of the TTT curve below about 250–300
°C
indicates, however, that the transformation speeds up
again and takes place exceedingly fast, even though
atomic mobilityin thistemperature range must be very
low. For this reason, it is concluded that the marten-
site transformation does not depend on the speed ofmigration of carbon atoms and, consequently, it is
often referred to as a diffusionless transformation. The
austenite only starts transforming to martensite whenthe temperature falls below a critical temperature, usu-
ally denoted by M

8.3.2 Austenite–pearlite transformation
8.3.2.1 Nucleation and growth of pearlite
If a homogeneous austenitic specimen of eutectoid
composition were to be transferred quickly to abath held at some temperature between 720
°Ca n d
550°C, decomposition curves of the form shown in
Figure 8.19a would be obtained. These curves, typical
of a nucleation and growth process, indicate thatthe transformation undergoes an incubation period, anaccelerating stage and a decelerating stage; the volumetransformed into pearlite has the time-dependencedescribed by the Avrami equation (7.44). When the
transformation is in its initial stage the austenite
contains a few small pearlite nodules each of whichgrow during the period A to B (see curve obtainedat 690
°C) and, at the same time, further nuclei form.
The percentage of austenite transformed is quite small,since the nuclei are small and their total volume
represents only a fraction of the original austenite.
During the B to C stage the transformation rateaccelerates, since as each nodule increases in size thearea of contact between austenite and pearlite regionsalso increases: the larger the pearlite volumes, thegreateristhesurfaceareauponwhichtodepositfurther
transformation products. At C, the growing nodules
begin to impinge on each other, so that the area ofcontact between pearlite and austenite decreases andfrom this stage onwards, the larger the nodules thelower is the rate of transformation. Clearly, the rate oftransformation depends on (1) the rate of nucleation ofpearlitenodules, N(i.e.thenumberofnucleiformedin
unit volume in unit time), and (2) the rate of growth
of these nodules, G(i.e. the rate that the radius of
the nodule increases with time). The variation of NandGwith temperature for a eutectoid steel is shown
in Figure 8.19b.
The rate of nucleation increases with decreasing
temperature down to the knee of the curve and in
this respect is analogous to other processes of phase
precipitation where hysteresis occurs (see Chapter 3).
In addition, the nucleation rate is very structure sen-
sitive so that nucleation occurs readily in regions of
high energy where the structure is distorted. In homo-
geneous austenite the nucleation of pearlite occurs
almost exclusively at grain boundaries and, for this
reason,thesizeoftheaustenitegrains,priortoquench-
ing, has an important effect on hardenability (a term
which denotes the depth in a steel to which a fully
martensitic structure can be obtained). Coarse-grained
steels can be hardened more easily than ﬁne-grained
steelsbecause to obtainmaximum hardeningina steel,
the decomposition of austenite to pearlite should be
avoided, and this is more easily accomplished if the
grainboundaryarea,orthenumberofpotentialpearlite
nucleation sites, is small. Thus, an increase in austen-ite grain size effectively pushes the upper part of the
TTT curve to longer times, so that, with a given cool-
ing rate, the knee can be avoided more easily. The
structure-sensitivity of the rate of nucleation is also
reﬂected in other ways. For example, if the austenite
grain is heterogeneous, pearlite nucleation is observed
at inclusions as well as at grain boundaries. Moreover,
plasticdeformationduringtransformationincreasesthe
rate of transformation, since the introduction of dislo-
cations provides extra sites for nucleation, while the
vacanciesproducedbyplasticdeformationenhancethe
diffusion process.
The rate of growth of pearlite, like the rate of nucle-
ation,alsoincreaseswithdecreasingtemperaturedown
to the knee of the curve, even though it is governed
by the diffusion of carbon, which, of course, decreases
withdecreasing temperature. The reason for thisisthat
the interlamellar spacing of the pearlite also decreases
rapidly with decreasing temperature, and because the

carbon atoms do not have to travel so far, the carbon
supply is easily maintained. In contrast to the rate ofnucleation, however, the rate of growth of pearlite is
quite structure-insensitive and, therefore, is indiffer-
ent to the presence of grain boundaries or inclusions.These two factors are important in governing the size
of the pearlite nodules produced. If, for instance, the
steel is transformed just below A
1,w h e r et h er a t eo f
nucleation is very low in comparison with the rate
of growth (i.e. the ratio N/Gis small), very large
nodules are developed. Then, owing to the structure-
insensitivity of the growth process, the few nodules
formed are able to grow across grain boundaries, withthe result that pearlite nodules larger than the original
austenite grain size are often observed. By compari-
son, if the steel is transformed at a lower temperature,
just above the knee of the TTT curve where N/Gis
large, the rate of nucleation is high and the pearlitenodule size is correspondingly small.
8.3.2.2 Mechanism and morphology of pearlite
formation
The growth of pearlite from austenite clearly involves
two distinct processes: (1) a redistribution of carbon
(since the carbon concentrates in the cementite and
avoids the ferrite) and (2) a crystallographic change
(sincethestructureofbothferriteandcementitediffersfrom that of austenite). Of these two processes it is
generally agreed that the rate of growth is governed by
the diffusion of carbon atoms, and the crystallographicchangeoccurs asreadilyas theredistributionofcarbon
will allow. The active nucleus of the pearlite nodule
may be either a ferrite or cementite platelet, depending
on the conditions of temperature and composition
which prevail during the transformation, but usually itis assumed to be cementite. The nucleus may form at a
grain boundary as shown in Figure 8.20a, and after its
formationthesurroundingmatrixisdepletedofcarbon,sothatconditionsfavourthenucleationofferriteplates
adjacent to the cementite nucleus (Figure 8.20b). The
ferrite plates in turn reject carbon atoms into the
surrounding austenite and this favours the formation
of cementite nuclei, which then continue to grow. Atthe same time as the pearlite nodule grows sideways,
the ferrite and cementite lamellae advance into the
austenite, since the carbon atoms rejected ahead of theadvancing ferrite diffuse into the path of the growing
cementite (Figure 8.20c). Eventually,a cementite plate
of different orientation forms and this acts as a new
nucleus as shown in Figures 8.20d and 8.20e.
Homogeneous austenite, when held at a constant
temperature, produces pearlite at a constant rate
and with a constant interlamellar spacing. However,
the interlamellar spacing decreases with decreasingtemperature, and becomes irresolvable in the optical
microscope as the temperature approaches that
corresponding to the knee of the curve. An increase
in hardness occurs as the spacing decreases. Zener
explains the dependence of interlamellar spacing

on temperature in the following way. If the
interlamellar spacing is large, the diffusion distanceof the carbon atoms in order to concentrate inthe cementite is also large, and the rate of carbon
redistribution is correspondingly slow. Conversely, if
the spacing is small the area, and hence energy,of the ferrite-cementite interfaces become large.In consequence, such a high proportion of thefree energy released in the austenite to pearlitetransformation is needed to provide the interfacialenergy that little will remain to provide the ‘drivingforce’ for the change. Thus, a balance betweenthese two opposing conditions is necessary to allowthe formation of pearlite to proceed, and at aconstant temperature the interlamellar spacing remainsconstant. However, because the free energy change,
G, accompanying the transformation increases with
increasing degree of undercooling, larger interfacialareas can be tolerated as the temperature oftransformation is lowered, with the result thatthe interlamellar spacing decreases with decreasingtemperature.
The majority of commercial steels are not usu-
ally of the euctectoid composition (0.8% carbon), buthypo-eutectoid (i.e. <0.8% carbon). In such steels,
pro-eutectoid ferrite is ﬁrst formed before the pearlitereaction begins and this is shown in the TTT curveby a third decomposition line. From Figure 8.18b itcan be seen that the amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite
decreases as the isothermal transformation temperature
is lowered. The morphology of the precipitated fer-rite depends on the usual precipitation variables (i.e.temperature, time, carbon content and grain size) andgrowth occurs preferentially at grain boundaries andon certain crystallographic planes. The Widmanst ¨atten
278Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
pattern with ferrite growing along f111gplanes of the
parent austenite is a familiar structure of these steels.
8.3.2.3 Inﬂuence of alloying elements on
pearlite formation
With the exception of cobalt, all alloying elements in
small amounts retard the transformation of austenite
to pearlite. These elements decrease both the rate ofnucleation, N, and the rate of growth, G, so that the
top part of the TTT curve is displaced towards longertimes. This has considerable technological importancesince in the absence of such alloying elements, a steel
can only transform into the harder constituents of bai-
nite or martensite if it is in the form of very thinsections so that the cooling rate will be fast enough toavoid crossing the knee of the TTT curve during thecooling process and hence avoid pearlite transforma-tion. For this reason, most commercially heat-treatable
steels contain one or more of the elements chromium,
nickel, manganese, vanadium, molybdenum or tung-sten. Cobalt increases both NandG, and its effect
on the pearlite interlamellar spacing is contrary to theother elements in that it decreases the spacing.
Withlargeadditionsofalloyingelements,thesimple
form of TTT curve often becomes complex, as shown
in Figure 8.18c. Thus to obtain any desired structureby heat treatment a detailed knowledge of the TTTcurve is essential.
8.3.3 Austenite–martensite transformation
8.3.3.1 Crystallography of martensite formation
Martensite, the hardening constituent in quenched
steels, is formed at temperatures below about 200 °C.
The regions of the austenite which have transformedto martensite are lenticular in shape and may easily berecognized by etching, or from the distortion they pro-
duce on the polished surface of the alloy. These relief
effects, shown schematically in Figure 8.21, indicatethat the martensite needles have been formed not withtheaidofatomicdiffusionbutbyashearprocess,sinceif atomic mobility were allowed the large strain energyassociated with the transformed volume would then be
largely avoided. The lenticular shape of a martensite
needle is a direct consequence of the stresses producedin the surrounding matrix by the shear mechanism ofthe transformation and is exactly analogous to the sim-ilar effect found in mechanical twinning. The strainenergy associated with martensite is tolerated because
the growth of such sheared regions does not depend on
diffusion, and since the regions are coherent with thematrix they are able to spread at great speed throughthe crystal. The large free energy change associatedwith the rapid formation of the new phase outweighsthe strain energy, so that there is a net lowering offree energy.
Direct TEM observations of martensite plates have
shown that there are two main types of martensite, onewith a twinned structure (see Figure 8.22), known as
Figure 8.21 Schematic diagram of the observed shape

and Christian, 1956; courtesy of the Institute of Metals) .
acicular martensite, and the other with a high density
of dislocations but few or no twins, called massive
martensite.
In contrast to the pearlite transformation, which
involves both a redistribution of carbon atoms anda structural change, the martensite transformationinvolves only a change in crystal structure.
The structure cell of martensite is body-centred
tetragonal, which is a distorted form of a body-centred
cubic structure, and hence may be regarded as a super-saturated solution of carbon in ˛-iron. X-ray examina-
tion shows that while the c/aratio of the bct structure
of martensite increases with increasing carbon content,the curve of c/aratio against composition extrapolates
backto c/aD1forzero carboncontent,andthelattice
parameter is equal to that of pure ˛-iron (Figure 8.23).
From the crystallographic point of view the most
importantexperimentaldatainanymartensitetransfor-mation are the orientation relations of the two phasesand the habit plane. In steel, there are three groups of
orientations often quoted; those due to Kurdjumov and
Sachs, Nishiyama, and Greninger and Troiano, respec-tively. According to the Kurdjumov–Sachs relation, iniron–carbon alloys with 0.5–1.4% carbon, a f111g
/CR
plane of the austenite lattice is parallel to the f110g˛
plane of the martensite, with a h110i/CRaxis of the
former parallel to a h111i˛axis of the latter; the asso-
ciated habit plane is f225g/CR. In any one crystal there
are 24 possible variants of the Kurdjumov–Sachs rela-tionship, consisting of 12 twin pairs, both orientations

of a pair having the same habit plane. However, for
general discussion it is usual to choose one relationwhich may be written
⊿111/triangleleft
/CRk⊿101/triangleleft˛with [110] /CRk[111]˛
In the composition range 1.5–1.8% carbon the habit
plane changes to ³f259g/CRwith the orientation rela-
tionship unspeciﬁed. This latter type of habit plane hasalsobeenreportedbyNishiyamaforiron–nickelalloys(27–34%nickel) for which the orientationrelationship
is of the form
⊿111/triangleleft
/CRk⊿101/triangleleft˛with [121] /CRk[101]˛
However, Greninger and Troiano have shown by pre-
cision orientation determinations that irrational rela-tionships are very probable, and that in a ternaryiron–nickel–carbon alloy (0.8% carbon, 22% nickel),
⊿111/triangleleft
/CRis approximately 1 °from ⊿101/triangleleft˛with [121] /CR
approximately 2 °from [101] ˛, and is associated with
a habit plane about 5 °from ⊿259/triangleleft.
Figure 8.23 Variation of c and a parameters with carbon
content in martensite (after Kurdjumov, 1948) .8.3.3.2 Mechanism of martensite formation
The martensite transformation is diffusionless, and
therefore martensite forms without any interchange inthe position of neighbouring atoms. Accordingly, theobserved orientation relationships are a direct conse-
quence of the atom movements that occur during the
transformation.Theﬁrstsuggestionofapossibletrans-formation mechanism was made by Bain in 1934. Hesuggested that since austenite may be regarded as a
body-centred tetragonal structure of axial ratiop
2, the
transformation merely involves a compression of thec-axis of the austenite unit cell and expansion of the
˛-axis. The interstitially dissolved carbon atoms pre-
vent the axial ratio from going completely to unity,and, depending on composition, the c/aratio will be
between 1.08 and 1.0. Clearly, such a mechanism canonly give rise to three martensite orientations whereas,in practice, 24 result. To account for this, Kurdju-mov and Sachs proposed that the transformation takesplace not by one shear process but by a sequenceof two shears (Figure 8.24), ﬁrst along the elements⊿111/triangleleft
/CRh112i/CR, and then a minor shear along the ele-
ments ⊿112/triangleleft˛h111i˛; these elements are the twinning
elements of the fcc and bcc lattice, respectively. Thismechanism predicts the correct orientation relations,butnotthecorrecthabitcharacteristicsorreliefeffects.Accordingly, Greninger and Troiano in 1941 proposeda different two-stage transformation, consisting of aninitial shear on the irrational habit plane which pro-duces the relief effects, together with a second shearalong the twinning elements of the martensite lattice.If slight adjustments in spacing are then allowed, themechanism can account for the relief effects, habitplane, the orientation relationship and the change ofstructure.
Further additions to these theories have been made
in an effort to produce the ideal general theoryof the crystallography of martensite transformation.Bowles, for example, replaces the ﬁrst shear of the

Greninger–Troiano mechanism by the general type of
homogeneous deformation in which the habit plane
remains invariant, i.e. all directions in this plane are
unrotated and unchanged in length. However, in allsuch cases the problem resolves itself into one ofdetermining whether a homogeneous strain can trans-
form the /CR-lattice into the ˛-lattice, while preserv-
ing coherency at the boundary between them. Thehomogeneous strain does not do this, so that some
reasonable additional type of strain has to be added.
This shear can occur either by twinning or by slip,
the mode prevailingdependingonthe compositionand
cooling rate. Between carbon contents of 0.2% and
0.5% the martensite changes from dislocated marten-site arranged in thin lathes or needles to twinned aci-cular martensite arranged in plates. In the martensite
formed at low C contents (e.g. Fe–Ni alloys) the thin
lathes lie parallel to each other, with a f111g
/CRhabit,
to form pockets of massive martensite with jagged
boundaries due to the impingement of other nearby
pockets of lathes. The inhomogeneous shear producedbydeformationtwinningoccurson f112gplanesinthe
martensite, so that each martensite plate is made up of
parallel twin plates of thickness 2–50 nm. By oper-
ation of such a complex transformation mode with ahighindexhabitplanthesystemmaintainsaninvariant
interfacial plane.
Because of the shears involved and the speed of
the transformation it is attractive to consider that
dislocations play an important role in martensite for-
mation. Some insight into the basic dislocation mech-anisms has been obtained by in situobservations
during either cooling below M
sor by straining, but
unfortunately only for Ni–Cr austenitic steels with
low stacking-fault energy (i.e. /CR³20 mJ/m2). For
these alloys it has been found that stacking faults
are formed either by emitting partial dislocations with
bDa/6h112ifrom grain boundaries or by the dis-
sociation of unit dislocations with bDa/2h110i.I n
regions of the grain where on cooling or deformation
a high density of stacking faults developed, the corre-
sponding diffraction pattern revealed cph ε-martensite.
On subsequent deformation or cooling, regions of ε-
martensite transform rapidly into bcc ˛-martensite,
and indeed, the only way in which ˛-martensite was
observed to form was from an εnucleus.

Strengthening and toughening 281
Because straining or cooling can be interrupted
during the in situexperiments it was possible to
carry out a detailed analysis of the defect structureformed prior to a region becoming recognizably(from diffraction patterns) martensitic. In this wayit has been shown that the interplanar spacing
across the individual stacking faults in the austenite
decreased to the ⊿0001 /triangleleftspacing appropriate to
ε-martensite. Figure 8.25 shows micrographs which
reveal this change of spacing; no contrast is expectedin Figure 8.25b if the faulted f111gplanes remained
at the fcc spacing, since the condition of invisibility
g.RDnis obeyed. The residual contrast observed
arises from the supplementarydisplacement Racross
the faults which, from the white outer fringe, ispositive (intrinsic) in nature for both faults and ³
2% of the f111gspacing. The formation of regions
of˛from εcould also be followed although in
this case the speed of the transformation precluded
detailed analysis. Figure 8.26 shows a micrograph
taken after the formation of ˛-martensite and this,
together with continuous observations, show that themartensite/matrix interface changes from f111gto the
well-known f225gas it propagates. Clearly, one of
the important roles that the formation of ε-martensite
plays in acting as a precursor for the formation
of˛-martensite is in the generation of close-packed
planes with ABABstacking so that atomic shufﬂes
can subsequently transform these planes to f110gbcc

8.3.3.3 Kinetics of martensite formation
One of the most distinctive features of the martensite
transformation is that in most systems martensite is
formed only when the specimen is cooling, and thatthe rate of martensite formation is negligible if cool-
ing is stopped. For this reason, the reaction is often
referred to as an athermal
1transformation, and the
percentage of austenite transformed to martensite is
indicated on the TTT curve by a series of horizontallines. The transformation begins at a temperature M
s,
which is not dependent on cooling rate, but is depen-
dent on prior thermal and mechanical history, and oncomposition. For example, it is well established that
theM
stemperature decreases approximately linearly
with increasing concentration of solutes such as car-
bon, nickel or manganese.
Speed of formation The observation that martensite
plates form rapidly and at a rate which is
temperature-independent shows that thermal activation
is not required for the growth process. Electronicmethods show that the martensite needles form, in
iron–nickel–carbon alloys, for example, in about
10
/NUL7s and, moreover, that the linear growth velocity
is about 103ms/NUL1even at very low temperatures.
Such observations show that the activation energy for
the growth of a martensite plate is virtually zero, and
that the velocity of growth approaches the speed ofsound in the matrix. Sometimes a ‘burst phenomenon’
is exhibited, as, for example, in iron–nickel alloys,
when the stresses produced by one martensite plateassist in the nucleation of others. The whole process is
autocatalytic and about 25% of the transformation can
occur in the time interval of an audible click.
The effect of applied stress Since the formation of
martensite involves a homogeneous distortion of the
parent structure, it is expected that externally applied
1In some alloys, such as iron–manganese–carbon and
iron–manganese–nickel, the martensitic transformation
occurs isothermally. For these systems, growth is still very
rapid but the nuclei are formed by thermal activation.
282Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
stresses will be of importance. Plastic deformation is
effective in forming martensite above the Mstempera-
ture, provided the temperature does not exceed a criti-cal value usually denoted by M
d. However, cold work
above Mdmay either accelerate or retard the transfor-
mation on subsequent cooling. Even elastic stresses,when applied above the M
stemperature and main-
tained during cooling, can affect the transformation;
uniaxial compression or tensile stresses raise the Ms
temperature while hydrostatic stresses lower the Ms
temperature.
Stabilization When coolingis interruptedbelow Ms,
stabilization of the remaining austenite often occurs.Thus, when cooling is resumed martensite forms only
after an appreciable drop in temperature. Such ther-
mal stabilization has been attributed by some workersto an accumulation of carbon atoms on those dislo-cations important to martensite formation. This may
be regarded as a direct analogue of the yield phe-
nomenon. The temperature interval before transfor-mation is resumed increases with holding time and is
analogous to the increase in yield drop accompanying
carbon build-up on strain-ageing. Furthermore, whentransformation in a stabilized steel does resume, itoften starts with a ‘burst’, which in this case is analo-
gous to the lower yield elongation.
8.3.4 Austenite–bainite transformation
The bainite reaction has many features common toboth the pearlite and martensite reactions. The pearlite
transformation involves the redistribution of carbonfollowed by a structure change, the martensite trans-formation involves the structure change alone, and, in
contrast, the bainite transformation involves a struc-
ture change followed by the redistribution of car-bon, which precipitates as a carbide. Consequently,
the austenite–bainite decomposition may be regarded
as a martensite transformation involving the diffusionof carbon atoms, so that, in this case, the rate ofcoherent growth is necessarily slow compared with
that of martensite. Lower bainite is hardly distinguish-
able from martensite tempered at the same tempera-ture, while upper bainite exhibits an acicular structure.
The metallographic appearance of the transformed
steel is found to alter continuously between these twoextremes,theactualstructureexhibitedbeinggoverned
by the diffusion rate of the carbon, which in turn
depends on the temperature of the transformation. Thehardness of the reaction product also increases con-tinuously with decreasing temperature, lower bainite
being harder than upper bainite, which is harder than
most ﬁne pearlite.
The ferrite in bainite has a martensite-like appear-
ance and is, in most cases, clearly distinguished from
both ferrite and pro-eutectoid ferrite formed in thepearlite range. The bainitic ferrite exhibits the samesurface relief effects as martensite, while pro-eutectoid
ferrite and pearlite do not. Such surface tilting is fur-
ther evidence for a shear-like transformation, but theorientation relationship between austenite and bainite
is not necessarily the same as that between austeniteand martensite. In fact, the bainitic ferrite has the same
orientation with respect to the parent austenite as does
pro-eutectoid ferrite, which suggests that ferrite maynucleate bainite.
8.3.5 Tempering of martensite
The presence of martensite in a quenched steel, while
greatly increasing its hardness and TS, causes the
material to be brittle. Such behaviour is hardly surpris-ing, since the formation of martensite is accompanied
byseverematrixdistortions.Thehardnessandstrength
of martensite increase sharply with increase in C con-tent.Contributionstothestrengtharisefromthecarbon
in solution, carbides precipitated during the quench,
dislocations introduced during the transformation andthe grain size.
Although the martensite structure is thermodynam-
ically unstable, the steel will remain in this conditionmore or less indeﬁnitely at room temperature because
for a change to take place bulk diffusion of car-
bon, with an activation energy Qof approximately
83 kJ/mol atom is necessary. However, because there
is an exponential variation of the reaction rate with
temperature, the steel will be able slowly to approachthe equilibrium structure at a slightly elevated temper-
ature, i.e. rate of reaction DAexp[/NULQ/kT]. Thus, by
acarefullycontrolledtemperingtreatment,thequench-ingstressescanberelievedandsomeofthecarboncan
precipitate from the supersaturated solid solution to
form a ﬁnely dispersed carbide phase. In this way, thetoughnessofthesteelcanbevastlyimprovedwithvery
little detriment to its hardness and tensile properties.
The structural changes which occur on tempering
may be considered to take place in three stages. In
the primary stage, ﬁne particles of a cph carbide
phase ( ε-carbide) of composition about Fe
2,4C, pre-
cipitates, with the corresponding formation of low-
carbon martensite. This low-carbon martensite grows
at the expense of the high-carbon martensite until atthe end of this stage the structure consists of retained
austenite, ε-carbide and martensite of reduced tetrago-
nality. During the second stage any retained austenitein the steel begins to transform isothermally to bainite,
while the third stage is marked by the formation of
cementite platelets. The precipitation of cementite isaccompanied by a dissolution of the ε-carbide phase
so that the martensite loses its remaining tetragonality
and becomes bcc ferrite. The degree to which thesethree stages overlap will depend on the temperature
of the anneal and the carbon content. In consequence,
the ﬁnal structure produced will be governed by theinitial choice of steel and the properties, and hence
thermal treatment, required. Alloying elements, with
the exception of Cr, affect the tempering of marten-site. Plain carbon steels soften above 100
°Co w i n gt o
the early formation of ε-carbide, whereas in Si-bearing
steels the softening is delayed to above 250 °C, since
Strengthening and toughening 283
Si stabilizes ε-carbide and delays its transformation
to cementite. Alloying additions (see Table 8.2) thusenable the improvement in ductility to be achieved at
higher tempering temperatures.
When a steel specimen is quenched prior to temper-
ing, quenching cracks often occur. These are caused
by the stresses which arise from both the transfor-
mation and the differential expansion produced whendifferent parts of the specimen cool at different rates.
To minimize such cracking, the desired properties of
toughness and strength are often produced in the steelby alternative heat-treatment schedules; examples of
these schedules are summarized in Figure 8.28, from
whichitwillbecomeevidentthatadvantageistakenofthe shape of the TTT curve to economize on the timethe specimen is in the furnace, and also to minimize
quenchingstresses. During conventionalannealing, for
example, the steel is heated above the upper criticaltemperature and allowed to cool slowly in the fur-
nace. In isothermal annealing the steel is allowed to
transform in the furnace, but when it has completelytransformed, the specimen is removed from the fur-
nace and allowed to air-cool, thereby saving furnace
time. In martempering, the knee of the TTT curve isavoided by rapid cooling, but the quench is interrupted
above M
sand the steel allowed to cool relatively
slowly through the martensite range. With this treat-ment the thermal stresses set up by very rapid cooling
are reduced. Such a procedure is possible because at
the holding temperature there is ample time for thetemperature to become equal throughout the sample
before the transformation begins, and as a result the
transformation occurs much more uniformly. After thetransformation is complete, tempering is carried out
in the usual way. In austempering, quenching is again
arrested above M
sand a bainite product, having sim-
ilar properties to tempered martensite, is allowed to
form.
Alloying elements also lower the Mstemperatures
and, consequently, greater stresses and distortion are
introduced during quenching. This can be minimized
by austempering and martempering as discussedabove, but such treatments are expensive. Alloying

maximum retardation of tempering for minimum
depression of Ms; Table 8.2 shows that (1) C should
be as low as possible, (2) Si and Co are particularlyeffective, and (3) Mo is the preferred element of theMo, W, V group since it is easier to take into solution
than V and is cheaper than W.
Some elements, particularly Mo and V, produce
quite high tempering temperatures. In quantities above
about 1% for Mo and
1
2% for V, a precipitation reac-
tion is also introduced which has its maximum hard-
ening effect at 550 °C. This phenomenon of increased
hardness by precipitation at higher temperatures isknown as secondary hardening and may be classiﬁed
as a fourth stage of tempering. 2–2
1
2Mo addition pro-
duces adequate temper resistance and changes the pre-
cipitate to Mo 2C which is more resistant to overageing
than Cr 7C3which is present in most alloy steels. High
V additions lead to undissolved V 4C3at the quench-
ing temperature, but 0.5 V in conjunction with 2Mo
does not form a separate carbide during tempering butdissolves in the Mo
2C. Cr also dissolves in Mo 2C
but lowers the lattice parameters of the carbide andhence lowers the temper resistance by decreasing the
matrix/carbide mismatch. However, 1Cr may be toler-
ated withoutseriousreductionintemper resistance andreduces the tendency to quench crack. Si decreases thelattice parameter of matrix ferrite and hence increasestemper resistance. A typical secondary hardening steelusually contains 0.4C, 2Mo, 0.5V, 0.5Si and 1.5Cr,
with 1 .8 GN/m
2TS and 15% elongation.
8.3.6 Thermo-mechanical treatments
To produce steels with an improved strength/ductility
ratio the heat-treatment may be modiﬁed to include
a deformation operation in the process. The combineduseofmechanicalworkingandheat-treatmentisgener-ally called thermo-mechanical treatment (THT). Threetypesoftreatmenthaveprovedsuccessfulwithmarten-
sitic and bainitic steels. These may be classiﬁed as
follows:
1. Deformation in the stable austenite range above A
3
before transformation, i.e. (HTHT).
2. Deformation below A 1before transformation; this
(LTHT) low-temperature thermo-mechanical treat-
ment is called ausforming.
3. Deformation during isothermal transformation to
pearlite, i.e. below A 3, known as isoforming.
The main advantage of HTHT is in grain reﬁne-
ment, and steels such as silicon-steels that recrystallizeslowly are particularly suitable. It can, however, beapplied to low-alloy high-carbon tool steels which arenot suitable for ausforming, with signiﬁcant increases
in strength and toughness. The fatigue limit is also
improved in many steels provided the deformation islimited to 25–30%. In ausforming, the deformation is

usually carried out in the range 450–550 °C and hence
the steel must have a large bay in the TTT diagram
to enable the deformation to be carried out. A suitable
steel is Fe–0.35C–0.5Mn–1.5Ni–1.25Cr–0.25Mofor
which the strength increases by about 4 .6–7.7M N / m2
for each per cent of deformation. The properties are

thatduringtransformationthemartensiteformedislesssupersaturated in C and thus has lower tetragonality
and is more ductile. The carbides also pin the dis-
locations in the austenite, helping to retain some of
them together with those formed during the transfor-
mation.Themartensiteformedisthereforeheavilydis-locatedwithrelativelystabledislocations(comparedto
those which would be formed by deforming marten-
site at room temperature), and has superior strengthand toughness. Such steels are, of course, somewhat
difﬁcult to machine.
Isoforming has potential in improving the toughness
of low-alloy steels. During isoforming to pearlite the
normal ferrite/pearlite structure is modiﬁed, by thepolygonization of sub-grains in the ferrite and the
spheroidizing of cementite particles. Isoforming to
bainite is also possible.
8.4 Fracture and toughness
8.4.1 Grifﬁth micro-crack criterion
Most materials break at a stress well below the theo-
retical fracture stress, which is that stress, /ESCt, required
to pull apart two adjoining layers of atoms. This stress
varies with the distance between the atom planes and,
as shown in Figure 8.29, may be approximated to asine curve of wavelength such that

Glass ﬁbres and both metallic and non-metallic
whiskers have strengths approaching this ideal value

favourableconditions(e.g.at4 K)canrarelywithstand
stresses above E/100. Grifﬁth, in 1920, was the ﬁrst to
suggest that this discrepancy was due to the presence
of small cracks which propagate through the crystal
and cause fracture. Grifﬁth’s theory deals with elastic
cracks, where at the tip of the crack atomic bonds
exist in every stage of elongation and fracture. As thecrack grows, each of the bonds in its path take up the
strain, and the work done in stretching and breaking
these bonds becomes the surface energy /CRof the
fractured faces. If separation of the specimen between
two atomic layers occurs in this way, the theoretical

for the smallest tensile stress /ESCable to propagate a

depends on the assumption that the crack will spreadif the decrease in elastic strain energy resulting froman increase in 2 cis greater than the increase in surface
energy due to the increase in the surface area of
the crack.
Grifﬁth’s theory has been veriﬁed by experiments
on glasses and polymers at low temperatures, where a
simple process of fracture by the propagationof elastic
cracks occurs. In such ‘weak’ brittle fractures thereis little or no plastic deformation and /CRis mainly

strength /ESCf³10/NUL5E. In crystalline solids, however,
the cracks are not of the elastic type and a plastic zoneexists around the crack tip as shown in Figure 8.30.
In such specimens, fracture cannot occur unless the
applied tensile stress /ESCis magniﬁed to the theoretical
strength /ESC
t. For an atomically sharp crack (where the
radius of the root of the crack ris of the order of b)o f

will be given by /ESCmD/ESCp⊿c/r/triangleleftwhich, if the crack is
to propagate, must be equal to the theoretical fracturestress of the material at the end of the crack. It follows
that substituting this value of /ESC

leads to the Grifﬁth formula of equation (8.23).
Figure 8.30 shows the way the magniﬁed stress
drops off with distance from the tip of the crack.

8.4.2 Fracture toughness
In engineering structures, particularly heat-treated
steels, cracks are likely to arise from weld defects,
inclusions, surface damage, etc. and it is necessary todesign structures with the knowledge that cracks arealready present and capable of propagation at stressesbelow the macroscopic yield stress as measured in atensile test. Since different materials show differentcrack propagation characteristics (e.g. hard steel andglass) it is necessary for the design engineers to ﬁndthe limiting design stress in terms of some propertyor parameter of the material. For this reason, a
fracture toughness parameter is now being employed
to measure the tendency of cracks of given dimensionsto propagate under particular stress conditions.
In Section 8.4.1 it was shown that /ESCp

when a material is stressed to a value /ESCand the crack

length for fast fracture is a constant,p⊿EG/triangleleftfor the
material, where Eis Young’s modulus and Gis the
strain energy release rate. The term /ESCp⊿/EMc/triangleleftis given
the symbol Kand is called the stress intensity factor
with units MN m/NUL3/2. Fast fracture will then occur
when KDKc,w h e r e Kc[Dp⊿EGc/triangleleft] is the critical
stress intensity factor, or more commonly the fracture
toughness parameter.
The fracture toughness of a material can alter
markedly depending on whether the elastic-plasticﬁeld ahead of the crack approximates to plane strainor plane stress conditions, much larger values beingobtained under plane stress conditions as operate in
thin sheets. The important and critical factor is the
size of the plastic zone in relation to the thickness ofthe section containing the crack. When this is small,as in thick plates and forgings, plane strain conditionsprevail and the hydrostatic tension ahead of the crackresults in a semi-brittle ‘ﬂat’ fracture. When the value
is large as in thin sheets of ductile metals plane stress
conditions operate and the tension at the crack front issmaller, giving rise to a more ductile mode of failure.At intermediate values a mixed fracture, with a ﬂatcentre bordered by shear lips, is obtained. Thus with-
outchangingthestructureorpropertiesofthematerials
in any way it is possible to produce a large differ-ence in fracture toughness by changing the sectionthickness. For thick sections, when a state of completeconstraint is more nearly approached, the values of K
c
andGcapproach minimum limiting values. These val-
ues are denoted by KIcandGIcand are considered to
be material constants; the subscript I denotes the ﬁrstmode of crack extension, i.e. the opening mode (seeFigure 8.31).
The general procedure in measuring the fracture
toughness parameter is to introduce a crack of suit-
able size into a specimen of suitable dimension and
geometry. The specimen is then loaded at a slow rateand the crack extension measured up to the criticalcondition. The measurement of K
Icwill be valid if the
plastic zone size is small (by a factor 10) in relationto the cross-section of the specimen. The zone size
r
ymay be obtained by equating the stress ﬁeld of the
crack at rDryto the strength /ESCyof the material and
is given by
ryDK2
Ic/2/EM/ESC2
y
An Ashby property chart of fracture toughness versus
strength, given in Figure 8.32, shows that the size ofthe zone (broken lines) varies from atomic dimensions
for brittle ceramics to tens of centimetres for ductile
metals.
In designing safe structures for a given load, the
structure is required to yield before it breaks. For aminimum detectable crack size of 2 cthis condition is
given by ⊿K
Ic//ESCy/triangleleft½p/EMc. The safest material is the
one with the greatest value of KIc//ESCy. Clearly, a highyield stress /ESCyis also required. The chart shows that
steel satisﬁes both these requirements and indicates
why it is still the best material for highly stressedstructures where weight is not important.
Fracture toughness requirements are now written
intothegeneralspeciﬁcationofhigh-technologyalloysand hence it is necessary to determine the effect
of heat-treatment and alloying additions on fracture
toughness parameters. Processes such as ausformingand controlled rolling improve the fracture toughness
of certain steels. Carbon has a considerable effect and
there are advantages in reducing the C-level below0.1% where possible. High-strength low-alloy (HSLA)
steels have C
/H113890.1% and the Nb, V and Ti addi-
tions form ﬁne carbides which together with the smallgrain sizes enable good strength levels and acceptable
fracture toughness values to be achieved. Maraging
steels with high alloy and low carbon ⊿<0.04%/triangleleftgive
very high strength combined with high toughness (see
Chapter 9).
The brittleness of ceramics is directly linked to their
high notch-sensitivity. The fracture toughness of most
ceramics is low: expressed in quantitative terms, it is
commonly less than 8 MN m
/NUL3/2.F l a w s ,o f t e nv e r y
minute, are almost invariably present in ceramics and
act as stress-concentrating notches. It is extremely dif-
ﬁcult to prevent these ﬂaws from forming during man-ufacture and service. In terms of engineering practice,
brittle ceramic components are intolerant of misalign-
ment and poor ﬁts within assemblies. The presence ofﬂaws is also responsible for the variability or ‘spread’
of results from mechanical tests and introduces uncer-
tainty into the design process. (The ‘spread’ is muchless for metallic materials.) Design procedures have
movedwellbeyondtheprinciplethatceramicsareonly
safe when compressive stresses are dominant. Prob-abilistic assessments of mechanical test results from
ceramics now tackle the difﬁcult task of allowing for
randomness in the size, shape and distribution of ﬂaws(see Section 10.6).
Despite these underlying problems, progress has
been made in producing tough ‘ductile ceramics’.

Fracture toughness values above 20 MN m/NUL3/2have
been achieved. Typical measures include eliminationof ﬂaws (microcracks, pores), incorporation of crack-retarding phases (in zirconia) and reduction of averagegrain size (below 1 mm).
At ambient temperature, fracture surfaces of ceram-
ics are conchoidal (glassy), intergranular or cleavagein character, depending on the material. The strainat fracture is very small, being about 0.001. At ele-vated temperatures, under creep conditions, fracturestrain is greater. Conventional ceramics have littleor no capacity for slip and crack tips therefore tendto remain sharp. As the crack propagates, the load-
supporting cross-section gets smaller and the general
level of stress increases so that failure can be sudden.These remarks refer to tensile stresses since compres-
sive stresses will, of course, tend to close the crack.
In some polycrystalline ceramics, such as magnesia,
the von Mises criterion for maintenance of cohesionsis not satisﬁed. Slip is limited and cracks are not effec-
tively blunted. However, raising the temperature often
enables the necessary minimum of ﬁve independentdeformationmodestooperate,leadingtoductility.Any
treatments which eliminate surface ﬂaws will natu-
rally enhance this ductility. (Against this background,one can readily appreciate why fabrication methodsfor polycrystalline ceramic components, in contrast to
those for metals, are not based upon bulk deforma-
tion.) At these higher temperatures the environmentbecomesincreasinglymorelikelytoreactwithsurfaces
288Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
of the ceramic: it may even penetrate an open texture
and cause crack-blunting. The mechanisms of ﬂow
in polycrystalline ceramics at elevated temperatures
are similar to those encountered in metallic systems
(e.g. glide and climb of dislocations, vacancy diffu-sion, grain boundary sliding). The similarity between
deformation processes in polycrystalline ceramics and
metals is evident if one compares the layout of thecorresponding deformation-mechanism maps. A minor
phase is usually present at grain boundary surfaces in
ceramics, functioning as a ceramic bond, and if it soft-
ens with rise in temperature, then the grains may be
able to slide past each other. These regions tend toliquefy before the actual grains so that it is advisable
not to exceed the solidus temperature. Grain boundary
surfaces are particularly susceptible to the nucleationof cracks. As in the ﬁnal accelerating stage of metal-
lic creep, these cracks form in planes normal to the
direction of applied stress.
8.4.3 Cleavage and the ductile–brittle
transition
The fracture toughness versus strength chart, shown
in Figure 8.32, indicates the wide spread of values
for the different classes of material. Metals dissi-pate much energy in the plastic zone, which accounts
for the difference between the fracture energy G
Ic
and the true surface energy /CR. The larger the zone,
the more energy is absorbed; GIcis high and so is
KIc⊿³100 MN m/NUL3/2/triangleleft. Ceramics and glasses fracture
without much plastic ﬂow to blunt the cracks by sim-ply breaking atomic bonds, leading to cleavage; for
these materials K
Icis less than 10 MN m/NUL3/2.
At low temperatures some metals, notably steels,
also become brittle and fracture by cleavage. Sincethey are ductile at room temperature this transitionto brittle cleavage behaviour is quite spectacular and
has led to several engineering catastrophes. In general,
brittle cleavage can occur in metals with bcc and cphunder the appropriate conditions while in fcc materialsit does not. The most important factor linking thesethree different structures is the Peierls stress and theway the yield stress varies with temperature. In steel,for example, the yield stress increases rapidly withlowering of temperature below room temperature suchthat plastic deformation at the crack tip is minimized
and the fracture mechanism changes from plastic tear-
ing to cleavage. Even in these materials some plasticdeformation does occur.
Several models have been suggested for the pro-
cess whereby glide dislocations are converted intomicro-cracks. The simplest mechanism, postulated byStroh,isthatinvolvingapile-upofdislocationsagainsta barrier, such as a grain boundary. The appliedstress pushes the dislocations together and a crack
forms beneath their coalesced half-planes, as shown
in Figure 8.33a. A second mechanism of crack for-mation, suggested by Cottrell, is that arising from thejunction of two intersecting slip planes. A dislocationgliding in the ⊿101/triangleleftplane coalesces with one gliding
in the ⊿10
1/triangleleftplane to form a new dislocation which
lies in the ⊿001/triangleleftplane according to the reaction,
a/2[111]Ca/2[111] !a[001]
The new dislocation, which has a Burgers vector
a[001], is a pure edge dislocation and, as shown
in Figure 8.33b, may be considered as a wedge, onelattice constant thick, inserted between the faces of the⊿001/triangleleftplanes. It is considered that the crack can then
grow by means of other dislocations in the ⊿101/triangleleftand
⊿10
1/triangleleftplanes running into it. Although the mechanism
readily accounts for the observed ⊿100/triangleleftcleavage
Figure 8.33 Formation of a crack (a) by the piling up of dislocations against a grain boundary after strain and (b) by the

plane of bcc metals, examples have not been directly
observed.
While these dislocation coalescence mechanisms
may operate in single-phase materials, in two-phasealloysitisusuallyeasiertonucleatecracksbypilingup
dislocations at particles (e.g. grain boundary cementite
or cementite lamellae in pearlite). The pile-up stressthen leads to cracking of either the particle or theparticle/matrix interface. A brittle–ductile transition
can then be explained on the basis of the criterion
that the material is ductile at any temperature, if theyield stress at that temperature is smaller than thestress necessary for the growth of these micro-cracks,but if it is larger the material is brittle. If cleavage
cracks are formed by such a dislocation mechanism,
the Grifﬁth formula may be rewritten to take accountof the number of dislocations, n, forming the crack.
Thus, rearranging Grifﬁth’s formula we have
/ESC⊿2c/ESC/E/triangleleftD/CRD2c/ESC
2/E
where the product of length 2 cand the strain /ESC/Eis
the maximum displacement between the faces of thecrack. This displacement will depend on the number
of dislocations forming the cleavage wedge and may
be interpreted as a pile-up of nedge dislocations, each
of Burgers vector a, so that equation (8.23) becomes
/ESC⊿na/triangleleftD/CR (8.25)
and gives a general criterion for fracture. Physically,
this means that a number of glide dislocations, n,r u n
together and in doing so cause the applied stress actingon them to do some work, which for fracture to occurmustbeatleastsufﬁcienttosupplytheenergytocreate
the new cracked faces, i.e. ⊿/CRC/CR
p/triangleleft.
Qualitatively, we would expect those factors which
inﬂuence the yield stress also to have an effect on the
ductile–brittle fracture transition. The lattice ‘friction’term /ESC
i, dislocation locking term ky, and grain size 2 d
should also all be important because any increase in
/ESCiandky, or decrease in the grain size, will raise the
yield stress with a corresponding tendency to promote
brittle failure.
These conclusions have been put on a quantitative
basis by Cottrell, who considered the stress neededto grow a crack at or near the tensile yield stress,/ESC
y, in specimens of grain diameter, 2 d. Let us con-
sider ﬁrst the formation of a micro-crack. If /FSyis the
actual shear stress operating, the effective shear stress
acting on a glide band is only ⊿/FSy/NUL/FSi/triangleleft,w h e r e ,i t
will be remembered, /FSiis the ‘friction’ stress resist-
ing the motion of unlocked dislocations arising from
the Peierls–Nabarro lattice stress, intersecting disloca-tions or groups of impurities. The displacement nais
then given by
naD[⊿/FS
y/NUL/FSi/triangleleft//SYN]d (8.26)
where /SYNis the shear modulus and dis the length
of the slip band containing the dislocations (assumedhere to be half the grain diameter). Once a microcrack
is formed, however, the whole applied tensile stress
normal to the crack acts on it, so that /ESCcan be written
as (/FSyðconstant), where the constant is included to
account for the ratio of normal stress to shear stress.
Substituting for naand/ESCin the Grifﬁth formula
(equation (8.25)) then fracture should be able to occurat the yield point when /ESCD/ESC

This is a general equation for the propagation of a
crack at the lower yield point and shows what factors
are likely to inﬂuence the fracture process. Alternativemodels for growth-controlled cleavage fracture havebeendevelopedtoincorporatethepossibilityofcarbideparticles nucleating cracks. Such models emphasizethe importance of yield parameters and grain size aswell as carbide thickness. Coarse carbides give rise tolow fracture stresses, thin carbides with high fracture
stresses and ductile behaviour.
8.4.4 Factors affecting brittleness of steels
Many of the effects of alloying, heat treatment, and
condition of testing on brittle fracture can be rational-ized on the basis of the above ‘transition’ equation.
Ductile–brittle transition Under conditions where
thevalueoftheleft-handsideofequation (8.28)islessthan the value of the right-hand side, ductile behaviour
should be observed; when the left-hand side exceeds
the right-hand side the behaviour should be brittle.Sincetheright-handsideofequation (8.28)variesonlyslowlywithtemperature,itisthewayinwhichchangesoccur in values of the terms on the left of the equationwhich are important in determining the ductile–brittletransition. Thus, in a given material brittleness should
be favoured by low temperatures and high strain-rate,
because these give rise to large values of /ESC
iandky,
and by large grain sizes. On the right-hand side, the
typical effect of a sharp notch is to raise the transitiontemperature of structural steel from around 100 K fora normal tensile test into the range of 200–300 K,because the value of ˇis lowered.
Effects of composition and grain size At a con-
stant temperature, because the values of /ESCiandky
remain ﬁxed, thetransitionpointwilloccur ata critical
grain size above which the metal is brittle and belowwhich it is ductile.
290Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Figure 8.34 Inﬂuence of hydrogen on fracture behaviour showing (a) time-dependence and (b) temperature-dependence .
The inclusion in equation (8.28) of the grain-size
term, d1/2, in combination with the /ESCiterm, enables
many previous metallurgical misunderstandings to becleared up. It shows that there is no simple connection
between hardness and brittleness, since hardening pro-
duced by reﬁning the grain size reduces the brittleness,
whereas hardening due to an increase in /ESC
iincreases
the brittleness.
Heat treatment is generally used to control the grain
size of the sample and reﬁne the structure. ‘Killed’
steel has very good notch toughness, because alu-
minium additions reﬁne the grain size. Manganese
reduces the grain size and by combining with car-bon also reduces the k
yvalue so that this addition
is especially beneﬁcial in improving low-temperature
ductility. It is fairly evident that an improved notch
toughness steel, compared with that used for welded
ships in World War II, is given by increasing the man-
ganesecontentanddecreasingthecarboncontent,i.e.ahigh manganese-to-carbon ratio. Other additions, par-
ticularly nickel and chromium, have a similar effect on
low-temperature ductility.
The Group 6A metals (Cr, Mo and W) are more
susceptible to brittle fracture than the Group 5A met-als (V, Nb and Ta). A comparison of these metals in
terms of cleavage fracture is difﬁcult, however, since
Cr, Mo and W are susceptible to grain boundary frac-
ture because segregation of impurities to such regions
reduces the effective surface energy /CR. However, even
if this effect is eliminated by lowering the impurity
level, it appears that Ta, Nb and V are more ductile
than Fe, Mo, Cr and W, presumably because they have
al o w e r k
y//SYNratio, and a higher /CRvalue.
Work-hardening and irradiation-hardening Small
amounts of plastic deformation at room temperature,
which overcomes the yield point and unlocks some of
the dislocations, improves the ductility at low temper-atures. The room-temperature ductility of chromium is
similarlyaffectedbysmallamountsofplasticdeforma-
tionat 400
°C. In general, however, plastic deformation
which leads to work-hardening embrittles the metalbecause it raises the /ESCicontribution, due to the forma-
tion of intersecting dislocations, vacancy aggregates
and other lattice defects.
The importance of twins in fracture is not clear as
there are several mechanisms other than twinning forthe formation of a crack which can initiate fracture,
and there is good evidence that micro-cracks form in
steel in the absence of twins, and that cracks startat inclusions. Nevertheless, twinning and cleavage are
generally found under similar conditions of tempera-
ture and strain-rate in bcc transition metals, probablybecause both phenomena occur at high stress levels.
The nucleation of a twin requires a higher stress than
the propagation of the twin interface.
Irradiation-hardening also embrittles the metal.
According to the theory of this type of hardeningoutlined in Chapter 7, radiation damage can produce
an increase in both k
y(migration to dislocations
of vacancies or interstitials) and /ESCi(formation of
dislocation loops and other aggregated defects).However, for steel, radiation-hardening is principally
due to an increased /ESC
icontribution, presumably
because the dislocations in mild steel are already too
heavily locked with carbon atoms for any change
in the structure of the dislocation to make anyappreciable difference to k
y. Nevertheless, a neutron
dose of 1 .9ð1023nm/NUL2will render a typical ﬁne-
grained, unnotched mild steel, which is normally
ductileat /NUL196°C,quitebrittle.Moreover,experiments
onnotchedﬁne-grainedsteelsamples(seeFigure 7.1c)
show that this dose increases the ductile–brittletransition temperature by 65
°C.
Microstructure The change in orientation at indi-
vidual grain boundaries impedes the propagation ofthe cleavage crack by (1) creating cleavage steps,
(2) causing localized deformation, and (3) tearing near
the grain boundary. It is the extra work done ⊿/CR
p/triangleleftin
such processes which increases the apparent surface
energy /CRto⊿/CRsC/CRp/triangleleft. It follows, therefore, that the
smaller the distance a crack is able to propagate with-out being deviated by a change of orientation of thecleavage plane, the greater is the resistance to brittle
Strengthening and toughening 291
fracture. In this respect, the coarser high-temperature
products of steel, such as pearlite and upper bainite,have inferior fracture characteristics compared withthe ﬁner lower bainite and martensite products. Thefact that coarse carbides promote cleavage while ﬁne
carbides lead to ductile behaviour has already been
discussed.
8.4.5 Hydrogen embrittlement of steels
It is well known that ferritic and martensitic steelsare severely embrittled by small amounts of hydrogen.The hydrogen may be introduced during melting andretained during the solidiﬁcation of massive steel cast-ings. Plating operations (e.g. Cd plating of steel for
aircraft parts) may also lead to hydrogen embrittle-
ment. Hydrogen can also be introduced during acidpickling or welding, or by exposure to H
2Sa t m o -
spheres.
The chief characteristics of hydrogen embrittle-
ment are its (1) strain-rate sensitivity, (2) temperature-
dependence and (3) susceptibility to produce delayedfracture (see Figure 8.34). Unlike normal brittle frac-ture, hydrogen embrittlement is enhanced by slowstrain-rates and consequently, notched-impact tests
have little signiﬁcance in detecting this type of embrit-
tlement. Moreover, the phenomenon is not more com-mon at low temperatures, but is most severe in someintermediate temperature range around room tempera-ture (i.e. /NUL100
°C to 100 °C). These effects have been
taken to indicate that hydrogen must be present in the
material and must have a high mobility in order tocause embrittlement in polycrystalline aggregates.
A commonly held concept of hydrogen embrittle-
ment is that monatomic hydrogen precipitates at inter-
nal voids or cracks as molecular hydrogen, so that as
the pressure builds up it produces fracture. Alterna-tively, it has been proposed that the critical factor isthe segregation of hydrogen, under applied stress, to
regions of triaxial stress just ahead of the tip of the
crack, and when a critical hydrogen concentration isobtained, a small crack grows and links up with themain crack. Hydrogen may also exist in the void orcrack but it is considered that this has little effect on
the fracture behaviour, and it is only the hydrogen in
the stressed region that causes embrittlement. Neithermodel considers the Grifﬁth criterion, which must besatisﬁed if cracks are to continue spreading.
Anapplicationofthefracturetheorymaybemadeto
thisproblem.Thus,ifhydrogencollectsinmicrocracks
and exerts internal pressure P, the pressure may be
directly added to the external stress to produce a totalstress⊿PCp/triangleleftfor propagation. Thus the crack will
spread when
⊿PCp/triangleleftnaD⊿/CR
sC/CRp/triangleleft (8.29)
where the surface energy is made up from a true sur-
face energy/CRsand a plastic work term /CRp. The possi-
bilitythathydrogencausesembrittlement bybecoming
adsorbed on the crack surfaces thereby lowering /CRisthought to be small, since the plastic work term /CRp
is the major term controlling /CR, whereas adsorption
would mainly effect /CRs.
Supersaturated hydrogen atoms precipitate as
molecular hydrogen gas at a crack nucleus, or theinterface between non-metallic inclusions and the
matrix. The stresses from the build-up of hydrogen
pressure are then relieved by the formation ofsmall cleavage cracks. Clearly, while the crack is
propagating, an insigniﬁcant amount of hydrogen will
diffusetothecrack and,as aconsequence, thepressureinsidethecrackwilldrop.However,becausethelengthof the crack has increased, if a sufﬁciently large and
constant stress is applied, the Grifﬁth criterion will
still be satisﬁed and completely brittle fracture can,in theory, occur. Thus, in iron single crystals, the
presence or absence of hydrogen appears to have
little effect during crack propagation because the crackhas little difﬁculty spreading through the crystal. Inpolycrystalline material, however, the hydrogen must
be both present and mobile, since propagation occurs
during tensile straining.
When a sufﬁciently large tensile stress is applied
such that⊿pCP/triangleleftis greater than that required by the
Grifﬁth criterion, the largest and sharpest crack willstart to propagate, but will eventually be stopped at amicrostructural feature, such as a grain boundary, as
previously discussed. The pressure in the crack will
then be less than in adjacent cracks which have notbeen able to propagate. A concentration gradient will
then exist between such cracks (since the concentra-
tion is proportional to the square root of the pressureof hydrogen) which provides a driving force for dif-fusion, so that the hydrogen pressure in the enlarged
crack begins to increase again. The stress to propa-
gate the crack decreases with increase in length ofcrack, and since pis increased by straining, a smaller
incrementPof pressure may be sufﬁcient to get the
crack restarted. The process of crack propagation fol-lowed by a delay time for pressure build-up continueswith straining until the specimen fails when the area
between the cracks can no longer support the applied
load. In higher strain-rate tests the hydrogen is unableto diffuse from one stopped crack to another to help
the larger crack get started before it becomes blunted
by plastic deformation at the tip. The decrease in thesusceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement in specimenstested at low temperatures results from the lower pres-
sure build-up at these temperature since PVD3nRT,
and also because hydrogen has a lower mobility.
8.4.6 Intergranular fracture
Intergranular brittle failures are often regarded as a
special class of fracture. In many alloys, however,
there is a delicate balance between the stress requiredto cause a crack to propagate by cleavage and thatneeded to cause brittle separation along grain bound-
aries. Although the energy absorbed in crack propa-
gation may be low compared to cleavage fractures,
292Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
much of the analysis of cleavage is still applica-
ble if it is considered that chemical segregation tograin boundaries or crack faces lowers the surfaceenergy/CRof the material. Fractures at low stresses are
observed in austenitic chromium–nickel steels, due tothe embrittling effect of intergranular carbide precipi-tationatgrainboundaries.Hightransitiontemperaturesand low fracture stresses are also common in tungsten
and molybdenum as a result of the formation of thin
second-phase ﬁlms due to small amounts of oxygen,nitrogen or carbon. Similar behaviour is observed inthe embrittlement of copper by antimony and iron byoxygen,althoughinsome casesthesecond-phaseﬁlmscannot be detected.
A special intergranular failure, known as temper
embrittlement, occurs in some alloy steels when tem-pered in the range 500–600
°C. This phenomenon is
associated with the segregation of certain elements orcombinations of elements to the grain boundaries. Theamount segregated is very small ( ¾a monolayer) but
the species and amount has been identiﬁed by AES onspecimens fractured intergranularly within the ultra-high vacuum of the Auger system. Group VIB ele-ments are known to be the most surface-active in ironbut, fortunately, they combine readily with Mn and Crthereby effectively reducing their solubility. ElementsinGroupsIVBandVBarelesssurface-activebutoftenco-segregate in the boundaries with Ni and Mn. InNi–Cr steels, the co-segregation of Ni–P and Ni–Sboccurs, but Mo additions can reduce the tendency fortemper embrittlement. Since carbides are often presentin the grain boundaries, these can provide the cracknucleus under the stress concentration from disloca-tion pile-ups either by cracking or by decohesion ofthe ferrite/carbide interface, particularly if the interfa-cial energy has been lowered by segregation.8.4.7 Ductile failure
Ductile failure was introduced in Chapter 4 because
of the role played by voids in the failure processes,
which occurs by void nucleation, growth and coa-lescence. The nucleation of voids often takes placeat inclusions. The dislocation structure around parti-cle inclusions leads to a local rate of work-hardeninghigher than the average and the local stress on reach-
ing some critical value /ESC
cwill cause fracture of the
inclusion or decohesion of the particle/matrix inter-face, thereby nucleating a void. The critical nucleationstrainε
ncan be estimated and lies between 0.1 and
1.0 depending on the model. For dispersion-hardeningmaterials where dislocation loops are generated the
stress on the interface due to the nearest prismatic
loop, at distance r,i s/SYNb/r, and this will cause sepa-
ration of the interface when it reaches the theoreticalstrength of the interface, of order /CR
w/b. The param-
eterris given in terms of the applied shear strain
ε, the particle diameter dand the length kequal to
half the mean particle spacing as rD4kb/εd. Hence,
void nucleation occurs on a particle of diameter dafter
as t r a i nε,g i v e nb yεD4k/CRw//SYNdb. Any stress con-
centration effect from other loops will increase withparticle size, thus enhancing the particle size depen-dence of strain to voiding.
Once nucleated, the voids grow until they coalesce
to provide an easy fracture path. A spherical-shapedvoid concentrates stress under tensile conditions and,as a result, elongates initially at about C⊿³2/trianglelefttimes
the rate of the specimen, but as it becomes ellipsoidalthe growth-rate slows until ﬁnally the elongated void
grows at about the same rate as the specimen. At
some critical strain, the plasticity becomes localizedand the voidsrapidlycoalesce and fracture occurs. Thelocalization of the plasticity is thought to take placewhen the voids reach a critical distance of approach,

Void growth leading to failure will be much more

stable deformation, as well as on the ductile rupture
process of void nucleation and growth. Nevertheless,

The work of decohesion inﬂuences the progress of
voiding and is effective in determining the overallductilityinasimpletensiontestintwoways.Theonset
of voiding during uniform deformation depresses the
rate of work-hardening which leads to a reduction inthe uniform strain, and the void density and size at theonsetofneckingdeterminestheamountofvoidgrowthrequired to cause ductile rupture. Thus for matriceshavingsimilarwork-hardeningproperties,theonewiththe least tendency to ‘wet’ the second phase will show
both lower uniform strain and lower necking strain.
For matrices with different work-hardening potentialbut similar work of decohesion the matrix havingthe lower work-hardening rate will show the lowerreduction prior to necking but the greater reductionduring necking, although two materials will showsimilar total reductions to failure.
The degree of bonding between particle and matrix
may be determined from voids on particles annealedto produce an equilibrium conﬁguration by measuringthe contact angle /DC2of the matrix surface to the particle

Measurements show that the interfacial energy of TD
nickel is low and hence exhibits excellent ductilityat room temperature. Speciﬁc additions (e.g. Zr toTD nickel, and Co to Ni–Al
2O3alloys) are also
effective in lowering the interfacial energy, therebycausingthematrixto‘wet’theparticleandincreasethe
ductility. Because of their low /CR
I, dispersion-hardened
materials have superior mechanical properties at hightemperatures compared with conventional hardenedalloys.

dynamic recrystallization (after Ashby et al., 1979) .
8.4.8 Rupture
If the ductile failure mechanisms outlined above are
inhibited then ductile rupture occurs (see Figure 8.36).
Specimens deformed in tension ultimately reach a
stageofmechanicalinstabilitywhenthedeformationis
localized either in a neck or in a shear band. With con-
tinued straining the cross-section reduces to zero and
the specimen ruptures, the strain-to-rupture depending
on the amount of strain before and after localization.
These strains are inﬂuenced by the work-hardening
behaviour and strain-rate sensitivity. Clearly, rupture
is favoured when void nucleation and/or growth isinhibited. This will occur if (1) second-phase particles
are removed by zone-reﬁning or dissolution at high
temperatures, (2) the matrix/particle interface is strong
andε
nis high, (3) the stress state minimizes plas-
tic constraint and plane strain conditions (e.g. single
crystals and thin sheets), (4) the work-hardening rate
and strain-rate sensitivity is high as for superplastic
materials (in some superplastic materials voids do not
form but in many others they do and it is the growth
and coalescence processes which are suppressed), and
(5) there is stress relief at particles by recovery or
dynamic recrystallization. Rupture is observed in most
fcc materials, usually associated with dynamic recrys-
tallization.
8.4.9 Voiding and fracture at elevated
temperatures
Creep usually takes place above 0 .3Tmwith a rate
given by PεDB/ESCn,w h e r eBandnare material param-
eters, as discussed in Chapter 7. Under such condi-
tions ductile failure of a transgranular nature, sim-
ilar to the ductile failure found commonly at low
temperatures, may occur, when voids nucleated at
294Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
inclusions within the grains grow during creep defor-
mation and coalesce to produce fracture. However,because these three processes are occurring at T³
0.3T
m, local recovery is taking place and this delays
both the onset of void nucleation and void coales-cence. More commonly at lower stresses and longer
times-to-fracture, intergranular rather than transgranu-
lar fracture is observed. In this situation, grain bound-ary sliding leads to the formation of either wedgecracks or voids on those boundaries normal to thetensile axis, as shown schematically in Figure 8.37b.This arises because grain boundary sliding produces a
higher local strain-rate on an inclusion in the bound-
ary than in the body of the grain, i.e. Pε
local'Pε⊿fd/2r/triangleleft
wheref³0.3 is the fraction of the overall strain due
to sliding. The local strain therefore reaches the crit-ical nucleation strain ε
nmuch earlier than inside the
grain.
The time-to-fracture tfis observed to be /⊿1/Pεss/triangleleft,
which conﬁrms that fracture is controlled by power-law creep even though the rounded-shape of grainboundary voidsindicatesthat local diffusionmust con-tribute to the growth of the voids. One possibility is
that the void nucleation, even in the boundary, occu-
pies a major fraction of the lifetime t
f, but a more
likely general explanation is that the nucleated voidsorcracksgrowbylocaldiffusioncontrolledbycreepinthe surrounding grains. Figure 8.37c shows the voidsgrowing by diffusion, but between the voids the mate-
rial is deforming by power-law creep, since the dif-
fusion ﬁelds of neighbouring voids do not overlap.Void growth therefore depends on coupled diffusionand power-law creep, with the creep deformation con-trolling the rate of cavity growth. It is now believedthat most intergranular creep fractures are governed by
this type of mechanism.
At very low stresses and high temperatures where
diffusion is rapid and power-law creep negligible, thediffusion ﬁelds of the growing voids overlap. Under
these conditions, the grain boundary voids are able to
grow entirely by boundary diffusion; void coalescencethen leads to fracture by a process of creep cavita-tion(Figure 8.38). In uniaxialtensionthedrivingforcearises from the process of taking atoms from the void
surface and depositing them on the face of the grain
that is almost perpendicular to the tensile axis, so thatthe specimen elongates in the direction of the stressand work is done. The vacancy concentration near thetensileboundaryis c

in Chapter 7, where /DELis the atomic volume and /CRthe
surface energy per unit area of the void. Thus vacan-cies ﬂow usually by grain boundary diffusion from the
boundaries to the voids when /ESC½2/CR/r, i.e. when the
chemical potential difference ⊿/ESC/DEL/NUL2/CR/DEL/r/triangleleftbetween
the two sites is negative. For a void r'10

sion is required to keep the balance between growthrate and surface redistribution and with increasingstress the voids become somewhat ﬂattened.
8.4.10 Fracture mechanism maps
The fracture behaviour of a metal or alloy in different
stress and temperature regimes can be summarized
conveniently by displaying the dominant mechanisms

onafracturemechanismmap.Sevenmechanismshave
been identiﬁed, three for brittle behaviour including
cleavage and intergranular brittle fracture, and fourductile processes. Figure 8.39 shows schematic mapsforfcc andbcc materials,respectively.Notallthefrac-
ture regimes are exhibited by fcc materials, and even
some of the ductile processes can be inhibitedby alter-ingthemetallurgicalvariables.For example,intergran-ular creep fracture is absent in high-purity aluminium
but occurs in commercial-purity material, and because
the dispersoid suppresses dynamic recrystallization inTD nickel, rupture does not take place whereas it doesinNimonic alloys at temperatures where the /CR
0and
carbides dissolve.
In the bcc metals, brittle behaviour is separated into
three ﬁelds; a brittle failure from a pre-existing crack,well below general yield, is called either cleavage
1 or brittle intergranular fracture BIF1, depending
on the fracture path. An almost totally brittle failurefrom a crack nucleated by slip or twinning, below
general yield, is called either cleavage 2 or BIF2, anda cleavage or brittle boundary failure after general
yield and with measurable strain-to-failure is calledeither cleavage 3 or BIF3. In many cases, mixed
transgranular and intergranular fractures are observed,
asaresultofsmallchangesinimpuritycontent,textureor temperature which cause the crack to deviate fromone path to another, no distinction is then made in
the regime between cleavage and BIF. While maps
for only two structures are shown in Figure 8.39 it isevident that as the bonding changes from metallic to
ionic and covalent the fracture-mechanism ﬁelds will
move from left to right: refractory oxides and silicates,for example, exhibit only the three brittle regimes and
intergranular creep fracture.
8.4.11 Crack growth under fatigue conditions
Engineering structures such as bridges, pressure ves-
sels and oil rigs all contain cracks and it is necessaryto assess the safe life of the structure, i.e. the num-ber of stress cycles the structure will sustain before a
crack grows to a critical length and propagates catas-
trophically. The most effective approach to this prob-lem is by the use of fracture mechanics. Under static
stress conditions, the state of stress near a crack tip is
described byK, the stress intensityfactor, but in cyclic
loadingKvaries over a range K⊿DK
max/NULKmin/triangleleft.
The cyclic stress intensity Kincreases with time at
constant load, as shown in Figure 8.40a, because thecrack grows. Moreover, for a crack of length athe rate

is increased for a constant value of K,Kmaxwill
increase and thus as KmaxapproachesKIcthe value
of da/dNincreases rapidly in practice, despite the
constant value of K.
A survey of fatigue fractures indicates there are four
general crack growth mechanisms: (1) striation forma-tion, (2) cleavage, (3) void coalescence and (4) inter-granular separation; some of these mechanisms havebeen discussed in Chapter 7. The crack growthbehaviour shown in Figure 8.40b can be divided intothree regimes which exhibit different fracture mecha-nisms. In regime A, there is a considerable inﬂuenceof microstructure, mean stress and environment onthe crack growth rate. In regime B, failure generallyoccurs, particularly in steels, by a transgranular ductilestriation mechanism and there is often little inﬂuenceofmicrostructure,meanstressormildenvironmentsoncrack growth. The degree of plastic constraint whichvaries with specimen thickness also appears to havelittle effect. At higher growth rate exhibited in regime
C, the growthrates become extremely sensitivetobothmicrostructure and mean stress, with a change fromstriation formation to fracture modes normally asso-ciated with noncyclic deformation, including cleavageand intergranular fracture.

Modern alloy developments
9.1 Introduction
In this chapter we will outline some of the devel-
opments and properties of modern metallic alloys.
Crucial to these materials have been the signiﬁcant
developments that have taken place in manufacturing,
made possible by a more detailed understanding ofthe manufacturing process itself and of the behaviour
of the material during both processing and in-service
performance. Casting techniques in particular haveadvanced much over the past decade and now pro-
vide reliable clean material with precision. Process
modelling is developing to the extent that the process
designer is able to take the microstructural speciﬁ-
cation for a given composition, which controls theproperties of the material, and deﬁne an optimum man-
ufacturing route to provide the desired material and
performance. Modern alloys therefore depend on the
proper integration of alloy composition and structure
with processing to produce the desired properties andperformance.
9.2 Commercial steels
9.2.1 Plain carbon steels
Carbon is an effective, cheap, hardening element foriron and hence a large tonnage of commercialsteels contains very little alloying element. They
may be divided conveniently into low-carbon
(<0.3% C), medium-carbon (0.3–0.7% C) and high-
carbon (0.7–1.7% C). Figure 9.1 shows the effect
of carbon on the strength and ductility. The low-carbon steels combine moderate strength with excellent
ductility and are used extensively for their fabrication
properties in the annealed or normalized conditionfor structural purposes, i.e. bridges, buildings, cars
and ships. Even above about 0.2% C, however, the
ductility is limiting for deep-drawing operations, and
brittle fracture becomes a problem, particularly for

welded thick sections. Improved low-carbon steels
⊿<0.2% C /triangleleftare produced by deoxidizing or ‘killing’
the steel with Al or Si, or by adding Mn to reﬁnethe grain size. It is now more common, however, toadd small amounts ⊿<0.1%/triangleleftof Nb which reduces
the carbon content by forming NbC particles. Theseparticles not only restrict grain growth but also giverise to strengthening by precipitation-hardening withinthe ferrite grains. Other carbide formers, such as Ti,may be used but because Nb does not deoxidize, it ispossible to produce a semi-killed steel ingot which,because of its reduced ingot pipe, gives increasedtonnage yield per ingot cast.
Medium-carbon steels are capable of being quenched
to form martensite and tempered to develop toughnesswith good strength. Tempering in higher-temperatureregions (i.e. 350–550
°C) produces a spheroidized car-
bide which toughens the steel sufﬁciently for use as
298 Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
axles, shafts, gears and rails. The process of ausform-
ing can be applied to steels with this carbon contentto produce even higher strengths without signiﬁcantlyreducing the ductility. The high-carbon steels are usu-ally quench hardened and lightly tempered at 250
°C
to develop considerable strength with sufﬁcient ductil-ity for springs, dies and cutting tools. Their limitationsstem from their poor hardenability and their rapid soft-ening properties at moderate tempering temperatures.
9.2.2 Alloy steels
In low/medium alloy steels, with total alloying con-tent up to about 5%, the alloy content is governedlargely by the hardenability and tempering require-ments, although solid solution hardening and car-bide formation may also be important. Some of theseaspects have already been discussed, the main con-
clusions being that Mn and Cr increase hardenabil-
ity and generally retard softening and tempering; Nistrengthens the ferrite and improves hardenability andtoughness; copper behaves similarly but also retardstempering; Co strengthens ferrite and retards soften-ing on tempering; Si retards and reduces the volumechange to martensite, and both Mo and V retard tem-pering and provide secondary hardening.
In larger amounts, alloying elements either open
up the austenite phase ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 9.2a,
or close the /CR-ﬁeld (Figure 9.2b). ‘Full’ metals with
atoms like hard spheres (e.g. Mn, Co, Ni) favour close-packed structures and open the /CR-ﬁeld, whereas thestable bcc transition metals (e.g. Ti, V, Cr, Mo) close
the ﬁeld and form what is called a /CR-loop. The develop-
ment of austenitic steels, an important class of ferrous
alloys, is dependent on the opening of the /CR-phase
ﬁeld. The most common element added to iron toachieve this effect is Ni, as shown in Figure 9.2a. From
this diagram the equilibrium phases at lower temper-
atures for alloys containing 4–40% Ni are ferrite andaustenite. In practice, it turns out that it is unnecessary
to add the quantity of Ni to reach the /CR-phase boundary
at room temperature, since small additions of other ele-
ments tend to depress the /CR/˛transformation tempera-
ture range so making the /CRmetastable at room temper-
ature. Interstitial C and N, which most ferrous alloys
contain, also expand the /CR-ﬁeld because there are
larger interstices in the fcc than the bcc structure. Theother common element which expands the /CR-ﬁeld is
Mn. Small amounts ( <1%) are usually present in most
commercial steels to reduce the harmful effect of FeS.Up to 2% Mn may be added to replace the more expen-
sive Ni, but additions in excess of this concentration
have little commercial signiﬁcance until 12% Mn is
reached. Hadﬁeld’s steel contains 12–14% Mn, 1% C,
is noted for its toughness and its used in railway points,drilling machines and rock-crushers. The steel is water-
quenched to produce austenite. The fcc structure has
good fracture resistance and, having a low stacking-fault energy, work-hardens very rapidly. During the
abrasion and work-hardening the hardening is further
intensiﬁed by a partial strain transformation of the

Modern alloy developments 299
austenite to martensite; this principle is used also in
the sheet-forming of stainless steels (see below).
To make the austenitic steels resistant to oxida-
tion and corrosion (see Chapter 12) the element Cris usually added in concentrations greater than 12%.Chromium closes the /CR-ﬁeld, however, and with very
low carbon contents single-phase austenite cannotbe produced with the stainless ⊿>12%/triangleleftcomposition.
These alloys form the stainless (ferritic) irons andare easily fabricated for use as furnace components.Increasing the carbon content expands the /CR-loop
and in the medium-carbon range Cr contents withgood stainless qualities ⊿³15–18% /triangleleftcan be quench-
hardened for cutlery purposes where martensite isrequired to give a hard, sharp cutting edge. The com-bination of both Cr and Ni (i.e. 18/8) produces themetastable austenitic stainless steel which is used in
chemical plant construction, kitchenware and surgi-
cal instruments because of its ductility, toughness andcold-working properties. Metastable austenitic steelshave good press-forming properties because the strain-induced transformation to martensite provides an addi-tional strengthening mechanism to work-hardening,and moreover counteracts any drawing instability byforming martensite in the locally-thinned, heavily-deformed regions.
High-strength transformable stainless steels with
good weldability to allow fabrication of aircraft andengine components have been developed from the0.05–0.1% C, 12% Cr, stainless steels by secondaryhardening addition (1.5–2% Mo; 0.3–0.5% V). Smalladditions of Ni or Mn (2%) are also added to coun-
teract the ferrite-forming elements Mo and V to make
the steel fully austenitic at the high temperatures. Airquenching to give ˛followed by tempering at 650
°C
to precipitate Mo 2C produces a steel with high yield
strength (0 .75 GN/m2), high TS (1 .03 GN/m2)a n d
good elongation and impact properties. Even higherstrengths can be achieved with stainless (12–16% Cr;0.05% C) steels which although austenitic at roomtemperature (5% Ni, 2% Mn) transform on cooling to/NUL78
°C. The steel is easily fabricated at room temper-
ature, cooled to control the transformation and ﬁnallytempered at 650–700
°C to precipitate Mo 2C.
9.2.3 Maraging steels
A serious limitation in producing high-strength steelsis the associated reduction in fracture toughness. Car-bon is one of the elements which mostly affects thetoughness and hence in alloy steels it is reduced
to as low a level as possible, consistent with good
strength. Developments in the technology of high-alloysteels have produced high strengths in steels with verylow carbon contents ⊿<0.03%/triangleleftby a combination of
martensite and age-hardening, called maraging. Themaraging steels are based on an Fe–Ni containingbetween 18% and 25% Ni to produce massive marten-site on air cooling to room temperature. Additionalhardening of the martensite is achieved by precipita-
tion of various intermetallic compounds, principallyNi
3Mo or Ni 3⊿Mo, Ti /triangleleftbrought about by the addition
of roughly 5% Mo, 8% Co as well as small amountsof Ti and Al; the alloys are solution heat-treated at
815
°C and aged at about 485 °C. Many substitutional
elements can produce age-hardening in Fe–Ni marten-sites, some strong (Ti, Be), some moderate (Al, Nb,Mn, Mo, Si, Ta, V) and other weak (Co, Cu, Zr) hard-eners. There can, however, be rather strong interactions
between elements such as Co and Mo, in that the hard-
ening produced when these two elements are presenttogether is much greater than if added individually.It is found that A
3B-type compounds are favoured at
high Ni or ⊿NiCCo/triangleleftcontents and A 2B Laves phases
at lower contents.
In the unaged condition maraging steels have a yield
strength of about 0 .7 GN/m2. On ageing this increases
up to 2 .0 GN/m2and the precipitation-strengthening is
due to an Orowan mechanism according to the relation/ESCD/ESC
0C⊿˛/SYNb/L/triangleleft where /ESC0is the matrix strength,
˛a constant and Lthe interprecipitate spacing. The
primary precipitation-strengthening effect arises fromthe⊿CoCMo/triangleleftcombination, but Ti plays a double role
as a supplementary hardener and a reﬁning agent totie up residual carbon. The alloys generally have good
weldability, resistance to hydrogen embrittlement and
stress-corrosion but are used mainly (particularly the18% Ni alloy) for their excellent combination of highstrength and toughness.
9.2.4 High-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels
The requirement for structural steels to be welded sat-isfactorily has led to steels with lower C ⊿<0.1%/triangleleft
content. Unfortunately, lowering the C content reduces
the strength and this has to be compensated for by
reﬁning the grain size. This is difﬁcult to achieve withplain C-steels rolled in the austenite range but theaddition of small amounts of strong carbide-formingelements (e.g. <0.1% Nb) causes the austenite bound-
aries to be pinned by second-phase particles and ﬁne-
grain sizes ⊿<10
µm/triangleleftto be produced by controlled
rolling. Nitrides and carbonitrides as well as carbides,predominantly fcc and mutually soluble in each other,may feature as suitable grain reﬁners in HSLA steels;
examples include AlN, Nb(CN), V(CN), (NbV)CN,
TiC and Ti(CN). The solubility of these particles in theaustenite decreases in the order VC, TiC, NbC whilethe nitrides, with generally lower solubility, decreasein solubility in the order VN, AlN, TiN and NbN.
Because of the low solubility of NbC, Nb is per-
haps the most effective grain size controller. However,Al, V and Ti are effective in high-nitrogen steels, Albecause it forms only a nitride, V and Ti by formingV(CN) and Ti(CN) which are less soluble in austenite
than either VC or TiC.
The major strengthening mechanism in HSLA steels
is grain reﬁnement but the required strength level is
300 Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
obtained usually by additional precipitation strength-
ening in the ferrite. VC, for example, is more soluble
in austenite than NbC, so if V and Nb are used incombination, then on transformation of the austen-ite to ferrite, NbC provides the grain reﬁnement andVC precipitation strengthening; Figure 9.3 shows astress–strain curve from a typical HSLA steel.
Solid-solution strengthening of the ferrite is also
possible. Phosphorus is normally regarded as deleteri-ous due to grain boundary segregation, but it is a pow-erful strengthener, second only to carbon. In car con-struction where the design pressure is for lighter bodiesand energy saving, HSLA steels, rephosphorized and
bake-hardened to increase the strength further, have
allowed sheet gauges to be reduced by 10–15% whilemaintaining dent resistance. The bake-hardening arisesfrom the locking of dislocations with interstitials, asdiscussed in Chapter 7, during the time at the temper-ature of the paint-baking stage of manufacture.
9.2.5 Dual-phase (DP) steels
Much research into the deformation behaviour of spe-ciality steels has been aimed at producing improvedstrength while maintaining good ductility. The con-ventional means of strengthening by grain reﬁnement,solid-solution additions (Si, P, Mn) and precipitation-hardening by V, Nb or Ti carbides (or carbonitrides)have been extensively explored and a conventionallytreated HSLA steel would have a lower yield stress
of 550 MN m
/NUL2, a TS of 620 MN m/NUL2and a total
elongation of about 18%. In recent years an improvedstrength–ductility relationship has been found for low-carbon, low-alloy steels rapidly cooled from an anneal-ing temperature at which the steel consisted of amixture of ferrite and austenite. Such steels have
a microstructure containing principally low-carbon,
ﬁne-grained ferrite intermixed with islands of ﬁnemartensite and are known as dualphase steels. Typi-cal properties of this group of steels would be a TS
of 620 MN m
/NUL2, a 0.2% offset ﬂow stress of 380 MN
m/NUL2and a 3% offset ﬂow stress of 480 MN m/NUL2with
a total elongation ³28%.
The implications of the improvement in mechan-
ical properties are evident from an examination ofthe nominal stress–strain curves, shown in Figure 9.3.The dual-phase steel exhibits no yield discontinuitybut work-hardens rapidly so as to be just as strongas the conventional HSLA steel when both have beendeformed by about 5%. In contrast to ferrite–pearlitesteels, the work-hardening rate of dual-phase steelincreases as the strength increases. The absence of
discontinuous yielding in dual-phase steels is an advan-
tage during cold-pressing operations and this featurecombined with the way in which they sustain work-hardening to high strains makes them attractive mate-rials for sheet-forming operations. The ﬂow stress andtensile strength of dual-phase steels increase as the

dual-phase steels .
volume fraction of hard phase increases with a corre-
sponding decrease in ductility; about 20% volume frac-tion of martensite produces the optimum properties.
The dual phase is produced by annealing in the ( ˛C
/CR) region followed by cooling at a rate which ensures
that the /CR-phase transforms to martensite, although
some retained austenite is also usually present leadingto a mixed martensite–austenite (M–A) constituent.To allow air-cooling after annealing, microalloyingelements are added to low-carbon–manganese–siliconsteel, particularly vanadium or molybdenum and chro-mium. Vanadium in solid solution in the austeniteincreases the hardenability but the enhanced harden-ability is due mainly to the presence of ﬁne carboni-tride precipitates which are unlikely to dissolve ineither the austenite or the ferrite at the temperaturesemployed and thus inhibit the movement of the austen-ite/ferrite interface during the post-anneal cooling.
The martensite structure found in dual-phase steels
is characteristic of plate martensite having internalmicrotwins. The retained austenite can transform tomartensite during straining thereby contributing to theincreased strength and work-hardening. Interruptionof the cooling, following intercritical annealing, canlead to stabilization of the austenite with an increasedstrength on subsequent deformation. The ferrite grains(³5
µm) adjacent to the martensite islands are gen-
erally observed to have a high dislocation densityresulting from the volume and shape change associ-ated with the austenite to martensite transformation.Dislocations are also usually evident around retainedaustenitic islands due to differential contraction of theferrite and austenite during cooling.
Some deformation models of DP steels assume both
phases are ductile and obey the Ludwig relationship,with equal strain in both phases. Measurements by sev-eral workers have, however, clearly shown a partition-ing of strain between the martensite and ferrite, withthe mixed (M–A) constituent exhibiting no strain untildeformations well in excess of the maximum uniform

strain. Models based on the partitioning of strain pre-
dict a linear relationship between yield stress, TS andvolume fraction of martensite but a linear relationship
is not sensitive to the model. An alternative approach
is to consider the microstructure as approximating to
that of a dispersion-strengthened alloy. This would be
appropriate when the martensite does not deform and
still be a good approximation when the strain differ-
ence between the two phases is large. Such a model
affords an explanation of the high work-hardening rate,
as outlined in Chapter 7, arising from the interaction
of the primary dislocations with the dense ‘tangle’ of
dislocations generated in the matrix around the hard
phase islands.
Several workers have examined DP steels to deter-
mine the effect of size and volume fraction of the
hard phase. Figure 9.4 shows the results at two dif-
ferent strain values and conﬁrms the linear rela-
tionship between work-hardening rate ⊿d/ESC/dε/triangleleftand
⊿f/d/triangleleft
1/2predicted by the dispersion-hardening the-
ory (see Chapter 7). Increasing the hard phase volume
fraction while keeping the island diameter constant
increases the work-hardening rate, increases the TS
but decreases the elongation. At constant volume frac-
tion of hard phase, decreasing the mean island diameter
produces no effect on the tensile strength but increases
the work-hardening rate and the maximum uniformelongation (Figure 9.5). Thus the strength is improved
by increasing the volume fraction of hard phase
while the work-hardening and ductility are improved
by reducing the hard phase island size. Although
dual-phase steels contain a complex microstructure
it appears from their mechanical behaviour that they
can be considered as agglomerates of non-deformable
hard particles, made up of martensite and/or bainite
and/or retained austenite, in a ductile matrix of ferrite.
Consistent with the dispersion-strengthened model, the
Figure 9.4 Dependence of work-harde ning rate on (volume
fraction f/particle size)1/2for a dual-phase steel at strain
values of 0.2 and 0.25 (after Balliger and Gladman, 1981) .Bauschinger effect, where the ﬂow stress in compres-
sion is less than that in tension, is rather large in dual-
phase steels, as shown in Figure 9.6 and increases withincrease in martensite content up to about 25%. TheBauschinger effect arises from the long-range back-
stress exerted by the martensite islands, which add to
the applied stress in reversed straining.
The ferrite grain size can give signiﬁcant strengthen-
ing at small strains, but an increasing proportion of the
strength arises from work-hardening and this is inde-
pendent of grain-size changes from about 3 to 30
µm.
Solid solution strengthening of the ferrite (e.g. by sil-icon) enhances the work-hardening rate; P, Mn and
V are also beneﬁcial. The absence of a sharp yield
point must imply that the dual-phase steel contains ahigh density of mobile dislocations. The microstruc-ture exhibits such a dislocation density around the
martensite islands but why these remain unpinned at
ambient temperature is still in doubt, particularly asstrain-ageing is signiﬁcant on ageing between 423 and573 K. Intercritical annealing allows a partitioning ofthe carbon to produce very low carbon ferrite, while
aluminium- or silicon- killed steels have limited nitro-
gen remaining in solution. However, it is doubtfulwhether the concentration of interstitials is sufﬁcientlylow to prevent strain-ageing at low temperature; hence
it is considered more likely that continuous yielding
is due to the residual stress ﬁelds surrounding second-phase islands. Two possibilities then arise: (1) yieldingcan start in several regions at the same time rather
than in one local region which initiates a general yield
process catastrophically, and (2) any local region isprevented from yielding catastrophically because theglide band has to overcome a high back stress from
the M–A islands. Discontinuous yielding on ageing
at higher temperatures is then interpreted in terms ofthe relaxation of these residual stresses, followed byclassical strain-ageing.
In dual-phase steels the nvalue ³0.2 gives the
high and sustained work-hardening rate required whenstretch formability is the limiting factor in fabrica-tion. However, when fracture per se is limiting, dual-
phase steels probably perform no better than other
steels with controlled inclusion content. Tensile failureof dual-phase steels is initiated either by decohesionof the martensite–ferrite interface or by cracking of
the martensite islands. Improved fracture behaviour is
obtained when the martensite islands are unconnected,when the martensite–ferrite interface is free from pre-cipitates to act as stress raisers, and when the hardphase is relatively tough. The optimum martensite con-
tent is considered to be 20%, because above this level
void formation at hard islands increases markedly.
9.2.6 Mechanically alloyed (MA) steels
For strengthening at high temperatures, dispersion
strengthening with oxide, nitride or carbide particles is
an attractive possibility. Such dispersion-strengthenedmaterials are usually produced by powder processing,

a special form of which is known as mechanical alloy-
ing (MA).
Mechanical alloying is a dry powder, high-energy
ball-milling process in which the particles of elemen-
tal or pre-alloyed powder are continuously welded
together and broken apart until a homogeneous mix-
ture of the matrix material and dispersoid is pro-
duced. Mechanical alloying is not simply mixing on
a ﬁne scale but one in which true alloying occurs.
The ﬁnal product is then consolidated by a combina-
tion of high temperature and pressure (i.e. extrusion of
canned powder) or hot isostatic pressing (i.e. HIPing).
Further processing is by thermo-mechanical process-
ing (TMP) to produce either (1) ﬁne equiaxed grains
for good room-temperature strength and good fatigue
strength or (2) coarser, elongated grains to give goodhigh-temperature stress–rupture strength and thermal-
fatigue resistance.
Various types of ferrous alloy have been made
by mechanical alloying, including 17%Cr, 7%Ni,
1.2%Al precipitation-hardened austenitic martensiticsteel and Fe–25Cr–6Al–2Y. However, the most
highly developed material is the 20%Cr, 4.5%Al
ferritic stainless steel, dispersion-strengthened with
0.5% Y
2O3(MA 956 ).MA 956 which has been
made into various fabricated forms has extremely
good high-temperature strength (0.2% proof strength
is 200 MN m/NUL2at 600 °C, 100 MN m/NUL2at 1000 °Ca n d
75 MN m/NUL2at 1200 °C).
The high-strength capability is combined with exce-
ptional high-temperature oxidation and corrosion resis-
tance, associated with the formation of an aluminium
oxide scale which is an excellent barrier to carbon. Nocarburization occurs in hydrogen–methane mixtures at
1000
°C. Sulphidation resistance is also good.
MA 956 was originally developed for use in sheet
form in gas-turbine combustors but, with its combi-
nation of high strength up to 1300 °C, corrosion resis-
tance and formability, the alloy has found many other
applications in power stations, including oil and coal
burners and swirlers, and fabricated tube assemblies
for ﬂuid-bed combustion.
9.2.7 Designation of steels
The original system for labelling wrought steels wasdevised in 1941 and used En numbers. This systemwas replaced in 1976 by the British Standard (BS)
designation of steels which uses a six-unit system.
Essentially, it enables the code to express composi-
tion, steel type and supply requirements. The latter
is shown by three letters: M means supply to spec-
iﬁed mechanical properties, H supply to hardenabil-
ity requirements and A supply to chemical analysisrequirements. For convenience, steels are divided
into types; namely, carbon and carbon–manganese
steels, free-cutting steels, high-alloy steels and alloy
steels. For example, carbon and carbon–manganese
steels are designated by mean of Mn/letter/mean of
C. Thus 080H41 signiﬁes 0.6–1.0 Mn/hardenability
Modern alloy developments 303
requirement/0.38–0.45 C. Free-cutting steels are des-
ignated by 200–240/letter/mean of C. Thus 225M44signiﬁes free-cutting 0.2–0.3 S/mechanical propertiesrequirement/0.4–0.48 C with 1.3–1.7 Mn. High-alloysteels include stainless and valve steels. The desig-nation is similar to the AISI system and is given by300–499/letters/variants 11–19. Thus 304S15 (pre-
viously known as Type 304 as used by the AISI)
signiﬁes 0.06 max. C, 8–11 Ni, 17.5–19 Cr. Alloysteels are designated by 500–999/letter/mean of C.Thus 500–519 are Ni steels, 520–539 Cr steels,630–659 Ni–Cr steels, 700–729 Cr–Mo steels and800–839 Ni–Cr–Mo steels. Typically 530M40 signi-ﬁes 0.36–0.44 C, 0.9–1.2 Cr, supplied to mechanicalproperties.
Tables 9.1 and 9.2 give the compositions of typical
carbon, alloy and stainless steels.
9.3 Cast irons
In the iron-carbon system (Chapter 3) carbon is ther-modynamically more stable as graphite than cementite.At the low carbon contents of typical steels, graphite
is not formed, however, because of the sluggishnessof the reaction to graphite. But when the carbon con-
tent is increased to that typical of cast irons (2–4% C)
either graphite or cementite may separate depending
on the cooling rate, chemical (alloy) composition and
heat treatment (see Figure 9.7). When the carbon existsas cementite, the cast irons are referred to as white
because of the bright fracture produced by this brit-
tle constituent. In grey cast irons the carbon existsas ﬂakes of graphite embedded in the ferrite–pearlite
matrix and these impart a dull grey appearance to the
fracture. When both cementite and graphite are present
a ‘mottled’ iron is produced.
High cooling rates, which tend to stabilize the
cementite, and the presence of carbide-formers give
rise to white irons. The addition of graphite-forming
elements (Si, Ni) produces grey irons, even when
rapidly cooled if the Si is above 3%. These elements,
particularly Si, alter the eutectic composition whichmay be taken into account by using the carbon equiv-
alent of the cast iron, given by [total %C C⊿%SiC

%P/triangleleft/3], rather than the true carbon content. Phospho-
rus is present in most cast irons as a low meltingpoint phosphide eutectic which improves the ﬂuidityof the iron by lengthening the solidiﬁcation period; thisfavours the decomposition of cementite. Grey cast ironis used for a wide variety of applications because ofits good strength/cost ratio. It is easily cast into intri-cate shapes and has good machinability, since the chipsbreak off easily at the graphite ﬂakes. It also has a high
damping capacity and hence is used for lathe and other
machine frames where vibrations need to be dampedout. The limited strength and ductility of grey castiron may be improved by small additions of the car-bide formers (Cr, Mo) which reduce the ﬂake size andreﬁne the pearlite. The main use of white irons is as astarting material for malleable cast iron, in which thecementite in the casting is decomposed by annealing.Such irons contain sufﬁcient Si ⊿<1.3%/triangleleftto promote
the decomposition process during the heat-treatmentbut not enough to produce graphite ﬂakes during cast-
ing. White-heart malleable iron is made by heating thecasting in an oxidizing environment (e.g. hematite ironore at 900
°C for 3–5 days). In thin sections the carbon
is oxidized to ferrite, and in thick sections, ferrite atthe outside gradually changes to graphite clusters ina ferrite–pearlite matrix near the inside. Black-heartmalleable iron is made by annealing the white ironin a neutral packing (i.e. iron silicate slag) when thecementite is changed to rosette-shaped graphite nod-ules in a ferrite matrix. The deleterious cracking effectof the graphite ﬂakes is removed by this process and acast iron which combines the casting and machinabil-ity of grey iron with good strength and ductility, i.e.
TS 350 MN m
/NUL2and 5–15% elongation is produced.
It is therefore used widely in engineering and agricul-ture where intricate shaped articles with good strengthare required.
Even better mechanical properties (550 MN m
/NUL2)
can be achieved in cast irons, without destroying theexcellent casting and machining properties, by the pro-duction of a spherulitic graphite. The spherulitic nod-ules are roughly spherical in shape and are composedof a number of graphite crystals, which grow radiallyfrom a common nucleus with their basal planes nor-mal to the radial growth axis. This form of growthhabit is promoted in an as-cast grey iron by the addi-tion of small amounts of Mg or Ce to the moltenmetal in the ladle which changes the interfacial energybetween the graphite and the liquid. Good strength,toughness and ductility can thus be obtained in cast-ings that are too thick in section for malleabilizingand can replace steel castings and forgings in certainapplications.
Heat-treating the ductile cast iron produces austem-
pered ductile iron (ADI) with an excellent combinationof strength, fracture toughness and wear resistance fora wide variety of applications in automotive, rail andheavy engineering industries. A typical compositionis 3.5–4.0% C, 2–2.5% Si, 0.03–0.06% Mg, 0.015%maximum S and 0.06% maximum P. Alloying ele-ments such as Cu and Ni may be added to enhancethe heat-treatability. Heat-treatment of the cast ductileiron (graphite nodules in a ferrite matrix) consists ofaustenization at 950
°C for 1–3 hours during which the
matrix becomes fully austenitic, saturated with carbonas the nodules dissolve. The fully austenized castingis then quenched to around 350
°C and austempered
at this temperature for 1–3 hours. The austemperingtemperature is the most important parameter in deter-mining the mechanical properties of ADI; high austem-pering temperatures (i.e. 350–400
°C) result in high
ductility and toughness and lower yield and tensilestrengths, whereas lower austempering temperatures(250–300
°C) result in high yield and tensile strengths,
high wear resistance and lower ductility and tough-ness. After austempering the casting is cooled to roomtemperature.
The desired microstructure of ADI is acicular ferrite
plus stable, high-carbon austenite, where the presence

When the casting is austempered for longer timesthan that to produce the desired structure, carbidesare precipitated in the ferrite to produce bainite. Low

°C/trianglelefttransition carbides are formed, ε
carbides at the lower temperatures and /DC1carbides at the
higher. With long austempering times the high-carbon
austenite precipitates /US-carbide at the ferrite–austenite
boundaries. The formation of bainite does not result inany catastrophic change in properties but produces a
gradual deterioration with increasing time of austem-
pering. Typically, ADI will have a tensile strength of
1200–1500 MN m
/NUL2, an elongation of 6–10% and
KIc³80 MN m/NUL3/2. With longer austempering the
elongation drops to a few per cent and the KIcreducesto 40 MN m/NUL3/2. The formation of /US-carbide at the
ferrite–austenite boundaries must be avoided since thisleads to more brittle fracture. Generally, the strengthis related to the volume fraction of austenite and the
ferrite spacing. Figure 9.8 shows the microstructure of
Si spheroidal graphite (SG) iron and the correspondingfracture mode.
9.4 Superalloys
9.4.1 Basic alloying features
These alloys have been developed for high-temperature
service and include iron, cobalt and nickel-based
materials, although nowadays they are principallynickel-based. The production of these alloys over sev-eral decades (see Figure 9.9) illustrates the transition

alloy composition achievements to a more process-dominated control.
In these alloys /CR
0⊿Ni3Al/triangleleftand/CRŁ⊿Ni3Nb/triangleleftare the
principal strengtheners by chemical and coherencystrain hardening. The ordered /CR
0-Ni 3Al phase is an
equilibrium second phase in both the binary Ni–Aland Ni–Cr–Al systems and a metastable phase in theNi–Ti and Ni–Cr–Ti systems, with close matchingof the /CR
0and the fcc matrix. The two phases have
very similar lattice parameters ( /lessorsimilar0.25%, depending
on composition) and the coherency (interfacial energy
/CRI³10–20 mJ m2) confers a very low coarsening
rate on the precipitate so that the alloy overagesextremely slowly even at 0 .7T
m. In alloys containing
Nb, a metastable Ni 3Nb phase occurs but although
ordered and coherent, it is less stable than /CR0at high
temperatures.
Another source of strengthening is due to solid-
solution hardening; Cr is a major element, Co maybe added up to 20% and Mo, W and Ta up to a totalof 15%. These elements also dissolve in /CR
0so that the
hardening effect may be twofold. Additions of Cr, likeCo, also increase the /CR
0solvus and lower the stacking-
fault energy.
In high-temperature service, the properties of the
grain boundaries are as important as the strengtheningby/CR
0within the grains. Grain boundary strengthen-
ing is produced mainly by precipitation of chromiumand refractory metal carbides; small additions of Zrand B improve the morphology and stability of thesecarbides. Optimum properties are developed by multi-
stage heat-treatment; the intermediate stages producethe desired grain boundary microstructure of carbideparticles enveloped in a ﬁlm of /CR
0and the other stages
produce two size ranges of /CR0for the best combination
of strength at both intermediate and high temperatures.Table 9.3 indicates the effect of the different alloyingelements.
Some of the nickel-based alloys have a tendency to
form an embrittling /ESC-phase (based on the composition
FeCr) after long-term in-service applications, whencomposition changes occur removing /ESC-resisting ele-
ments such as Ni and enhancing /ESC-promoting elements
such as Cr, Mo or W. This tendency is predicted inalloy design by a technique known as Phacomp (phasecomputation) based on Pauling’s model of hybridiza-tion of 3 d-electrons in transition metals. While a frac-
tion of the 3 dorbitals hybridize with pandsorbitals
to create the metallic bond, the remainder forms non-bonding orbitals which partly ﬁll the electron holes inthed-shell, increasing through the transition series to
give electron hole numbers N
vfor Cr(4.66), Mn(3.66),
Fe(3.66), Co(1.71) and Ni( 0.66). Computation shows

9.4.2 Nickel-based superalloy development
A major application of superalloys is in turbine materi-
als, jet engines, both disc and blades. Initial disc alloyswere Inco 718 andInco 901 produced by conventional
casting ingot, forged billet and forged disc route. Thesealloys were developed from austenitic steels, which arestill used in industrial turbines, but were later replacedbyWaspaloy and Astroloy as stress and tempera-
ture requirements increased. These alloys were turbineblade alloys with a suitably modiﬁed heat-treatment fordiscs. However, blade material is designed for creep,whereas disc material requires tensile strength cou-pled with low cycle fatigue life to cope with the stresschanges in the ﬂight cycle. To meet these requirements
Modern alloy developments 307
Waspaloy was thermomechanically processed (TMP)
to give a ﬁne-grain size and a 40% increase in tensilestrength over the corresponding blade material, but atthe expense of creep life. Similar improvements fordiscs have been produced in Inco 901 by TMP. More
highly-alloyed nickel-based discs suffer from exces-sive ingot segregation which makes grain size controldifﬁcult. Further development led to alloys producedby powder processing by gas atomization of a moltenstream of metal in an inert argon atmosphere and con-solidating the resultant powder by HIPing to near-netshape. Such products are limited in stress applicationbecause of inclusions in the powder and, hence, torealize the maximum advantage of this process it isnecessary to produce ‘superclean’ material by electronbeam or plasma melting.
Improvements in turbine materials were initially
developed by increasing the volume fraction of /CR
0
in changing Nimonic 80A up to Nimonic 115 . Unfor-
tunately, increasing the ⊿TiCAl/triangleleftcontent lowers the
melting point, thereby narrowing the forging rangewhich makes processing more difﬁcult. Improvedhigh-temperature oxidation and hot corrosion perfor-mance has led to the introduction of aluminide andoverlay coatings and subsequently the development ofIN 738 andIN 939 with much improved hot-corrosion
resistance.
Further improvements in superalloys have depended
on alternative manufacturing routes, particularly usingmodern casting technology. Vacuum casting was ﬁrstused to retain high Ti and Al contents without oxi-dation loss. With 9–11% ⊿TiCAl/triangleleft, a 70% volume
fraction of /CR
0has been produced in IN 100 (Nimocast
PK 24 ) which does not require supplementary solid
solution strengtheners and therefore gives a saving in
density.2
Additions of high melting point elements such as W
extend the high-temperature capabilities at the expenseof density. M200 contains 12% W and 1% Nb but has
limited ductility around 760
°C which can be improved
by additions of hafnium. The signiﬁcant improvementin ductility and reduced porosity produced by Hfhas led to its addition to other alloys (e.g. Mar 001
⊿IN 100 CHf/triangleleftand Mar 004 ⊿IN 713 CHf/triangleleftandM002
which contains 10% W, 2.5% Ta and 1.5% Hf).
Creep failures are known to initiate at transverse
grain boundaries and, hence, it is reasonable to aimto eliminate them in the turbine blade to gain furtherimprovement in performance. Technologically this wasachieved by directional solidiﬁed (DS) castings withcolumnar grains aligned along the growth directionwith no grain boundaries normal to that direction. Byincorporating a geometric constriction into the mould
or by the use of a seed crystal it has been possible to
eliminate grain boundaries entirely and grow the blade
as one single crystal (see Chapter 3).
The elimination of grain boundaries immediately
removes the necessity for adding grain-boundary
strengthening elements. such as C, B, Zr and Hf. to
the superalloy. The removal of such elements raises
the melting point and allows a higher solution heat-
treatment temperature with consequent improvement inchemical homogeneity and more uniform distribution
of/CR
0precipitates. Particularly important, however,
is the control of the growth direction along the
[100] direction. The [100] alignment along the axis
of the blade gives rise to an intrinsic high creepwhich enables thermal stresses caused by temperature
gradients across the blade to be minimized.
Single-crystal blades have now been used success-
fully for both civil and military engines, SSR99 replac-
ingMar M002 but with improved tensile, creep and
fatigue properties and a lower-density alloy RR2000
replacing IN100 .
9.4.3 Dispersion-hardened superalloys
All/CR0-hardened alloys experience a reduction in
strength at elevated temperatures because of the
solution of /CR0precipitate. To produce improved high-
temperature strength, alloys hardened by oxides (ODSor oxide dispersion-strengthe ned), particularly thoria,
have been developed. TD nickel (i.e. thoria dispersion-
strengthened nickel or nickel with 2% ThO
2)a n d TD-
Nichrome (i.e. nickel–20% Cr–2% ThO 2) is produced
by mixing thoria sols with nickel-containing solutionsto ensure a good dispersion. Drying the oxide powder
mixture, followed by a hydrogen reduction process,
produces a ﬁne composite nickel–thoria powder.
Compaction and controlled TMP during extrusion
and rolling develops the structure and strength.These materials have excellent high-temperature creep
resistance, but poor low-temperature properties which
precludes aero-engine applications, although some
other applications have been found. It is not possible
to add the /CR
0-forming elements via the above process
to produce lower-temperature strengthening because
aluminium and titanium oxide are not reduced by
hydrogen.
Mechanical alloying (MA) is a dry powder process
and overcomes this problem. MA, a high-energy ball-milling process, produces a homogeneous mixture of
the matrix material and dispersoid. The ﬁnal product

strengthening that can be introduced and while
MA6000 can be run at higher temperatures than
conventional nickel-based s uperalloys, application is
then limited to areas where the loadings can be
kept low.
9.5 Titanium alloys
9.5.1 Basic alloying and heat-treatment
features
Since the emergence of titanium as a ‘wonder metal’
in the 1950s the titanium industry has developeda wide range of alloys with different compositions
(see Figure 9.11).1These alloys rely on the high
strength/weight ratio, good resistance to corrosion,combined low thermal conductivity and thermal expan-sion of titanium, properties which make it attractivefor aerospace applications in both engine and airframecomponents.
Titanium exists in the cph ˛form up to 882
°Ca n d
then as bcc ˇto its melting point. Alloying additions
change the temperature at which the ˛toˇtran-
sition takes place, solutes that raise the transus aretermed ˛-stabilizers and those that lower the ˇ-transus
temperature are termed ˇ-stabilizers (Figure 9.12). The
predominant ˛-stabilizer is aluminium. It is also an
effective ˛-strengthening element at ambient and ele-
vated temperatures up to 550
°C and thus a major con-
stituent of most commercial alloys. The low densityof aluminium is an important additional advantage.˛-phase strengthening is also achieved by additions
of tin and zirconium. These metals exhibit extensivesolubility in both ˛andˇtitanium but have little inﬂu-
ence on the ˇ-transus and are thus regarded as neutral
additions. ˇ-stabilizers may be either ˇ-isomorphous
(i.e. have the bcc structure like ˇ–Ti) or ˇ-eutectoid
elements. ˇ-isomorphous elements have a limited ˛-
solubility and are completely soluble in ˇ-titanium,
typical additions being molybdenum, vanadium andniobium. In contrast, ˇ-eutectoid elements have a
restricted solubility in ˇ-titanium and form intermetal-
lic compounds by eutectoid decomposition of the ˇ-
phase. In some alloy systems containing ˇ-eutectoid
elements, such as silicon or copper, the compound for-mation (i.e., respectively, Ti
5Si3and Ti 2Cu) leads to an
improvement in mechanical properties. Titanium willalso take interstitial solutes in solid solution, hydro-gen being a ˇ-stabilizer while carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen are strong ˛-stabilizers. To minimize gas in Ti
leads to a high cost of manufacture and heat-treatmentrequires vacuum or inert gas conditions and freedomfrom refractory contact.
In describing titanium alloys it is conventional to
classify them in terms of the microstructural phase ( ˛-
alloys, ˇ-alloys, ( ˛Cˇ)-alloys or near- ˛-alloys, i.e.
predominantly ˛-phase but with a small volume of
ˇ-phase). Commercial alloys are usually heat-treated
to optimize the mechanical properties by controllingthe transformation of the ˇ-t o˛-phase, the extent of
which is governed by the alloy composition and thecooling rate. The ˛-alloys can transform completely
from the ˇ-t o˛-phase no matter what the cooling
rate. Such treatments have a negligible effect on prop-
erties and ˛-alloys tend to be used in the annealed
state.

310 Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Rapidly-cooled alloys containing ˇ-stabilizers form
martensitic ˛from the ˇ-phase, whereas slower cool-
ing rates favour ˛formation by a nucleation and
growth process. Several morphologies of ˛can be pro-
duced by controlling the nucleation and growth mech-
anism; slow cooling, for example, tends to produce
similarly aligned ˛platelets in colonies, combined with
primary ˛at the grain boundaries. Faster cooling and
higher ˛-stabilizer contents result in a basket-weave
microstructure. Metastable- ˇ, when aged, precipitates
ﬁne˛, giving increased strength. The less stable the ˇ,
the more ˛can be precipitated and hence the higher
the strength attained.
ˇ-stabilizing elements improve strength by strength-
ening the ˇ-phase. The microstructure consists of pri-
mary ˛combined with the ˇ-phase, which can be
strengthened by an ageing treatment to precipitateacicular- ˛. Further strengthening is achieved by the
limited solubility of the ˇ-stabilizing element. Gener-
ally, these alloys ha ve poor ductility properties.
The most important alloys contain both ˛-a n d ˇ-
stabilizers which, after working and annealing, give
good strength and fabrication properties. For goodcreep strength an ˛-titanium base, strengthened as
much as possible by solute elements, is required. To
meet this requirement the near- ˛alloys have been
developed. These alloys combine the high ˛stability
with sufﬁcient ˇ-stabilizer to give adequate strength.
Byˇheat-treating, the ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftmicrostructure changes
to a totally transformed ˇstructure containing basket-
weave ˛. These alloys have good creep resistance and
reasonable room-temperature properties. The basket-
weave morphology is effective in inhibiting crackgrowth, and near- ˛alloys exhibit lower crack prop-
agation rates than the ˛Cˇmicrostructures. Most of
the commercial alloys which have been recently devel-oped are of this type. The major factor inﬂuencing
the post-forging microstructure is the cooling rate; an
oil quench results in a basket-weave structure (seeFigure 9.13a) and an air cool gives a typically alignedmicrostructure (see Figure 9.13b). The alloy is usually
stress-relieved by annealing for 2 hours at 625
°Co r
above.
9.5.2 Commercial titanium alloys
˛alloys transform entirely to ˛on cooling from
theˇ-phase, regardless of cooling rate. Commercially
pure titanium with a nominal oxygen content of 500,1000, 1550 and 2700 ppm, respectively, gives tensile
properties which range from 450 to 640 MN m
/NUL2
(see Figure 9.14). These are used mainly in sheet
form. Solid-solution strengthening by aluminium, tin
or zirconium increases tensile and creep strength andIMI 317 (Ti–5Al–2.5Sn) is typical.
Increasing the ˛-stabilizing composition increases
creep strength but makes fabrication more difﬁcult andcan lead to embrittlement during prolonged exposure
at temperature in service due to the formation of the
coherent ordered phase ˛
2(Ti3Al). To avoid this it was
empirically established that the aluminium equivalentAl
Łmust be no greater than 9 where AlŁ(in wt %) is
given by:

IMI 317 is difﬁcult to fabricate and is often replaced
by an IMI 230, which is an ˛-phase alloy containing
the precipitation-hardening phase Ti 2C u ;i tc a nb e
fabricated and welded and has good strength and
ductility up to 400 °C.
ˇalloys contain enough ˇ-stabilizing elements
to maintain the bcc ˇ-phase to room temperature.
Unfortunately, bcc ˇ–Ti alloys are prone to
embrittlement. The binary alloys, titanium with
Fe, Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, Cr or V, all precipitatethe embrittling ω-phase. More complex ˇ–Ti
alloys containing Cr also suffer embrittlement fromTiCr

(e.g. (Ti–11.5Mo–6Zr–4.5Sn)) but are little used.

Modern alloy developments 311

However, ˇ-phase alloys, such as Ti–10V–2Fe–3Al,
have potential as airframe construction materials
offering high strength (1250 MN m/NUL2) and toughness
(45 MN m/NUL3/2) in relatively thick cross-sections
(90 mm) and superior hot-working characteristics
which are attractive in expensive forging operations.
⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftalloys are probably the most widely used
titanium alloys and contain alloying additions which
strengthen both phases. These alloys are thermo-
mechanical processed to control the size, shape and
distribution of both ˛andˇ. The most versatile
⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftalloy is IMI 318 , which contains 6% Al and
4% V; it can be used at temperatures up to 350 °Ca n d
has good forging and fabrication properties. It initiallyreplaced steel as a disc material in jet engines leading
to 20% weight saving. Another important ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftalloy
isIMI 550 (Ti–6Al–2Sn–4Mo–0.5Si) which has
higher strength and good creep resistance up to 400
°C.
⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftalloys remain the principal materials for fan
discs and blades and for low-and intermediate-pressure
compressor discs and blades of current gas turbine
engines. ⊿˛Cˇ/triangleleftalloys with extra low interstitial (ELI)
content are attractive as ‘damage-tolerant’ materials
for critical airframe components. Ti–6Al–4V with low
oxygen has a tensile strength 8% lower than the stan-dard alloy but, more importantly, the minimum fracture
toughness is 60 MN m
/NUL3/2.
Near- ˛-alloys have increased the strength and the
volume of the more creep-resistant ˛-phase at theexpense of the bcc ˇ-phase, which imports good low-
temperature strength and forgeability. IMI 685 was the
ﬁrst titanium alloy to operate above 500 °C. It contains
Ti–6Al–5Zr–0.5Mo–0.2Si with Al and Zr instead of
Sn as ˛-stabilizers, reduced Mo, the ˇ-stabilizer, to
minimize ˇat the ˛-needles and Si to improve creep
resistance. These alloys are worked and heat-treatedin the ˇ-range and have a tensile strength of about
1000 MN m
/NUL2and give less than 0.1% creep strain in
100 h under a stress of 310 MN m/NUL2at 520 °C.IMI
829 (Ti–5.6Al–3.5Sn–3Zr–1Nb–0.25Mo–0.3Si) has
been derived from IMI 685 by replacing some of the
Zr with the more potent strengthener Sn. It is ˇ-heat-
treated and has sufﬁcient higher-temperature capabil-ity to be used in the hotter regions of engines. IMI
834 (Ti–5.8Al–4Sn–3.5Zr–0.7Nb–0.5Mo–0.35Si–
0.06C) has been developed for use up to 600
°Ca n d
combines the high fracture toughness and crack propa-gation resistance of a transformed ˇ-structure with the
typical equiaxed structure of the ˛Cˇalloys, providing
good fatigue resistance and ductility. The small addition
of carbon allows a controlled high ˛/ˇ heat-treatment.
Hot-working is carried out in the ˛Cˇﬁeld and heat-
treatment involves solution treatment for 2 hours at1025
°C, consistent with about 15% primary ˛, followed
by oil quenching prior to ageing for 2 hours at 700 °C,
then air cooling. With such good high-temperature prop-erties the alloy is being speciﬁed for engine compressorapplications.

9.5.3 Processing of titanium alloys
Some of the titanium alloys have excellent superplastic
forming characteristics and fabricating manufacturers
have taken advantage of these properties in developingnew processing technologies. Fine-grained thin sheetsofIMI 318 have been superplastically deformed at
900
°C under slow strain-rate conditions to produce a
variety of complex parts. In conjunction with diffusionbonding, weight-saving of about one-third has beenachieved in, for example, the wing access panels of
the A320 Airbus. Near- ˛-alloys have also been shown
to exhibit superplastic behaviour.
Casting technology has also been developed. Invest-
ment casting of IMI 318 is widely used but there is
now increasing interest in the use of high-temperature
alloy castings as weight-saving alternatives to steel and
nickel alloys above 500
°C. The introduction of HIPing
for titanium castings has widened their potential appli-cation. For IMI 829, the best properties are obtained
in the ˛/ˇ HIP and solution-treated and aged condi-
tion, generally meeting the speciﬁcation for the alloyin the wrought condition. Rapid solidiﬁcation process-ing may also offer possibilities by incorporating Er
2O3
and other rare earth oxide dispersions into the titanium
matrix. At present, the control of these dispersoids
remains a problem.
To develop higher-performance materials than the
near-˛alloys into the 700–800 °C range, attention
is being given to strengthening high-temperature
alloy materials, including titanium aluminides (seeSection 9.6) with ceramic ﬁbres such as SiC and B
4C.
9.6 Structural intermetallic
compounds
9.6.1 General properties of intermetallic
compounds
In terms of their propertie s, intermetallic compounds
are generally regarded as a class of materials betweenmetals and ceramics which arises from the bondingbeing a mixture of metallic and covalent. Intermetallics
are intrinsically strong (and in the L1
2-ordered fcc
compounds increases with temperature up to about600
°C) with high elastic modulus. The strong bond-
ing and ordered structure also gives rise to lowerself-diffusion coefﬁcients and hence greater stability
of diffusion-controlled properties. Some of the com-
pounds of current interest are shown in Table 9.4.Intermetallics containing aluminium or silicon exhibit
a resistance to oxidation and corrosion because of their
adherent surface oxides. Those based on light elementshave attractive low density giving rise to high spe-ciﬁc properties particularly important in weight-saving
applications.
Like ceramics, however, the greatest disadvantage
of intermetallics is their low ductility, particularly atlow and intermediate temperatures. The reasons for
the lack of ductility vary from compound to com-
pound but include (1) a limited number of easy defor-mation modes to satisfy the von Mises criterion,
(2) operation of dislocations with large slip vectors,
(3) restricted cross-slip, (4) difﬁculty of transmittingslip across grain boundaries, (5) intrinsic grain bound-ary weakness, (6) segregation of deleterious solutes
to grain boundaries, (7) covalent bonding and high
Peierls-Nabarro stress and (8) environmental suscep-tibility. It has been demonstrated, however, that someintermetallics can be ductilized by small alloying addi-
tions: Ni
3Al with boron, TiAl with Mn, Ti 3Al with Nb.
This observation has encouraged recent research anddevelopment of intermetallics and the possibility of
application of those materials.
9.6.2 Nickel aluminides
Ni3Al(nickel aluminide ) is the ordered fcc /CR0phase
and is a major strengthening component in superalloys.
Ni3Al single crystals are reasonably ductile but in
polycrystalline form are quite brittle and fail by inter-granular fracture at ambient temperatures. The basic
slip system is f111gh110iand has more than ﬁve
independent slip modes but still exhibits grain bound-ary brittleness. Remarkably, small additions of ¾0.1
at.% boron produce elongations up to 50%. Gen-
eral explanations for this effect are that B segregatesto grain boundaries and (1) increases the cohesivestrength of the boundary and (2) disorders the grain
boundary region so that dislocation pile-up stresses
can be relieved by slip across the boundary ratherthan by cracking. This general explanation is nodoubt of signiﬁcance but additionally, there are dis-
tinct microstructural changes within the grains which

must lead to a reduced friction stress and ease the
operation of polyslip. For example, the addition of B
reduces the occurrence of stacking-fault defects. Addi-tion of solutes, such as B, are not expected to raise
the stacking-fault energy and hence this effect possi-
bly arises from the segregation of B to dislocations,preventing the superdislocation dissociation reactions(see Chapter 4, Section 4.6.5).
Microhardness measurements inside grains and
away from grain boundaries indeed show that boronsoftens the grains. The ductilization effect is limitedto nickel-rich aluminides and cannot be produced by
carbon or other elements, although some substitutional
solutes such as Pd, which substitutes for Ni, and Cuproduce a small improvement in elongation. Smalladditions of Fe, Mn and Hf have also been claimed
to improve fabricability. Grain size has been shown to
inﬂuence the yield stress according to the Hall–Petchequation and B appears to lower the slope k
yand
facilitate slip across grain boundaries. These alloys are
also known to be environmentally sensitive. Hf, for
example, which does not segregate to grain boundaries
but still improves ductility, has a large misﬁt (11%)and possibly traps H from environmental reactions,
such as Al CH
2O!Al2O3CH. Ti, which has a
small misﬁt, does not improve the ductility.
The most striking property of Ni 3Al is the increas-
ing yield stress with increasing temperature up to
the peak temperature of 600 °C (see Figure 9.15).
This behaviour is also observed in other L1 2inter-
metallics, particularly Ni 3Si and Zr 3Al. This effect
results from the thermaily-activated cross-slip of screw
dislocations from the f111gplanes to the f100gcube

planes where the apb-energy is somewhat lower. The
glide of super-dislocations is made more difﬁcult by
the formation of Kear–Wilsdorf (K–W) locks (seeChapter 7) and their frequency increases with tem-perature. Electron-microscopy measurements of apb
energies given in Table 9.5 shows that the apb energy
onf100gdecreases with aluminium content and this
inﬂuences the composition-dependence of the strength,
shown in Table 9.15. The cross-slip of screw disloca-
tions from the f111gplanes to cube planes also gives
rise to a high work-hardening rate.
Although the study of creep in /CR
0-based materials is
limited, it does appear to be inferior to that of super-
alloys. Above 0 .6Tmcreep displays the characteristic
primary and secondary stages, with steady-state creep
having a stress exponent of approximately 4 and an
activation energy of around 400 KJ mol/NUL1, consistent
with climb being the rate-controlling process. At inter-
mediate temperatures (i.e. around the 600 °C peak in
the yield stress curve) the creep behaviour does notdisplay the three typical stages. Instead, after primary
creep, the rate continuously increases with creep strain,
a feature known as inverse creep. In primary creep,planar dissociation leads to an initial high creep ratewhich slows as the screws dissociate on f100gplanes to
form K–W locks. However, it is the mobile edge dis-
locations which contribute most to the primary creepstrain and their immobilization by climb dissociationwhich brings about the exhaustion of primary creep.
The inverse creep regime is still not fully researched

of the cross-slipped screw components.
The fatigue life in high-cycle fatigue is related to
the inﬂuence of temperature on the yield stress andis invariant with temperature up to about 800
°C, but
falls off for higher temperatures with cracks propagat-
ing along slip planes. With boron doping the fatigue
resistance is very sensitive to aluminium content anddecreases substantially as Al increases from 24 to 26
at.%. Nevertheless, crack growth rates of Ni
3AlCB
are lower than for commercial alloys.
Hyperstoichiometric Ni 3Al with boron can be pre-
pared by either vacuum melting and casting or from
powders by HIPing. Fabrication into sheets is possible
with intermediate anneals at 1000 °C. At present, how-
ever, the application of Ni 3Al is not signiﬁcant; Ni 3Al
powders are used as bond coats to improve adher-
ence of thermal spray coatings. Nevertheless, Ni 3Al
alloys have been tested as heating elements, diesel

engine components, glass-making moulds and hot-
forging dies, slurry-feed pumps in coal-ﬁred boilers,hot-cutting wires and rubber extruders in the chemicalindustry. Ni
3Al-based alloys as matrix materials for
composites are also being investigated.
Nickel aluminide (NiAl) has a caesium chloride or
ordered ˇ-brass structure and exists over a very wide
range of composition either side of the stoichiomet-ric 50/50 composition. It has a high melting point of1600
°C and exhibits a good resistance to oxidation.
Even with such favourable properties it has not beencommercially exploited because of its unfavourablemechanical properties. Because it is strongly ordered,
low-temperature deformation occurs by an ah100idis-
location vector and not by a/2h111isuper-dislocations.
f110gh100islip therefore leads to insufﬁcient slip
modes to satisfy the general plasticity criterion andin the polycrystalline condition ˇ-NiAl is extremely
brittle. The ductility does improve with increasingtemperature but above 500
°C the strength drops off
considerably as a result of extensive glide and climb.
Improvements in properties are potentially possible byreﬁnement of the grain size and by using alloying addi-tions to promote h111islip, as in FeAl, which has
the same structure. In this respect, additions of Fe, Cror Mn appear to be of interest. For high-temperatureapplications, ternary additions of Nb and Ta have been
shown to improve creep strength through the precipi-
tation of second phases and mechanical alloying withyttria or alumina is also beneﬁcial.
A further commercial problem of this material is
that conventional production by casting and fabricationis difﬁcult, but production through a powder routefollowed by either HIPing or hot extrusion is more
promising.
9.6.3 Titanium aluminides
Because of the limited scope for improvements in
the properties of conventional titanium alloys above650
°C, either by alloy development or by TMP,
increased attention is being given to the titanium inter-metallics, Ti
3Al (˛2-phase) and TiAl ( /CR-phase). With
low density, high modulus and good creep and oxi-dation resistance up to 900
°C they have considerable
potential if the poor ductility at ambient temperaturescould be improved. A comparison of Ti 3Al- and TiAl-
based materials with conven tional Ti-alloys is given in
Table 9.6.
Electron microscopy studies of Ti3Alor˛2have
shown that deformation by slip occurs at room tem-perature by coupled pairs of dislocations with bD
1/6h11
20iwhich glide only on f10
10gplanes and by
very limited glide on f11
2
1gwith pairs of dislocation
withbD1/6h11
26i. The ductility increases at higher
temperatures due to climb of the h11
20idislocations
and to the increased glide mobility of 1 /6h11
20i
and 1 /6h11
26idislocations through thermal activa-
tion. Only limited activity of the f0001gh11
20islip
systems is observed, even at high temperatures.
The most successful improvements in the ductil-
ity of Ti 3Al have been produced by the addition of
ˇ-stabilizing elements, particularly niobium, to pro-
duce ˛2-alloys. An addition of 4 at.% Nb produces
signiﬁcant slip on f10
10gh11
20i,f0001gh11
20iand
f11
21gh11
26ias well as some slip on f1011gh1120i.
This improvement is attributed to the decrease in
covalency as Nb substitutes for Ti with a conse-
quent reduction in the Peierls–Nabarro friction stress.Alloys based on ˛
2are Ti–(23–25) Al–(8–18)Nb,
of which Ti–24Al–11Nb has excellent spalling resis-tance. Most Ti
3AlCNb alloys, such as super ˛2,
also contain other ˇ-stabilizers including Mo and V,
i.e. Ti–25Al–10Nb–3V–1Mo, which exhibits about
7% room temperature elongation. Alloying Ti 3Al with
ˇ-stabilizing elements to produce two-phase alloys
signiﬁcantly increases the fracture strength. TheseTi
3Al-based alloys can be plasma-melted and cast
followed by TMP in the ⊿˛2Cˇ/triangleleftorˇ-range. The
improved ductility of Ti 3Al alloys has led to aerospace
applications in after-burners in jet engines where it
compares favourably in performance with superalloysand gives a 40% weight-saving.
Developments are taking place in rapid solidiﬁcation
processing to include a second phase (e.g. rare-earthprecipitates) and to provide powders, which may be
consolidated by HIPing, to produce fully dense compo-
nents with properties compa rable to wrought products.
There are also developments in intermetallic matrixcomposites by the addition of SiC or Al
2O3ﬁbres
⊿¾10µm/triangleleft. These have some attractive properties, but
the ﬁbre/intermetallic interface is still a problem.

The/CR-phase Ti–(50–56)Al has an ordered fc tetrag-
onal⊿L10/triangleleftstructure up to the m.p. 1460 °C. with c/aD
1.02 (Figure 9.16). Deformation by slip occurs on
f111gplanes and, because of the tetragonality, there are
two types of dislocations, namely ordinary dislocations
1/2h110iand superdislocations h011iD1/2h011iC
1/2h011i. Another superdislocation 1 /2h112ihas also
been reported.
At room temperature, deformation occurs by both
ordinary and super dislocations. However, [011] and
[101] super dislocations are largely immobile because
segments of the trailing superpartials 1 /6h112i-type
form faulted dipoles. The dissociated 1 /2h110idislo-
cations bounding complex stacking faults are largely
sessile because of the Peierls–Nabarro stress. Some
limited twinning also occurs. The ﬂow stress increases
with increasing temperature up to 600 °C as the super-
partials become mobile and cross-slip from f111gto
f100gto form K–W-type locks, the 1 /2h110islip
activity increases and twinning is promoted.
The two-phase ⊿/CRC˛2/triangleleftTi-Al alloys have better
ductility than single-phase /CRwith a maximum at 48
at.% Al. This improvement has been attributed to the
reduced c/awith decreased Al, further promotion of
twinning and the scavenging of O 2and N 2interstitials
by˛2. Additions of V, Cr or Mn, which reduce the unit
cell, also improve ductility. However, the two-phase
microstructure is extremely important in optimizingthe tensile and creep properties and the fracture tough-
ness. Both the volume fraction and morphology of
the lamellar ˛
2-structure is important and about 30%
lamellar ˛2appears to be the optimum.
9.6.4 Other intermetallic compounds
A number of intermetallic compounds are already used
in areas which do not rely on stringent mechanical
properties. Fe 3Al, for example, is used in fossil-fuel
plants where resistance to both sulphur attack andoxidation is important. Ni 3Si is used where resistance
to hot sulphuric acid is required. There are severalcompounds with rare-earth elements used in magnettechnology (see Chapter 6). PdIn is gold-coloured anda possible dental material. Zr
3Al has a low neutron
capture cross-section and is a possible reactor material.
The ˇ-compound NiTi ( Nitinol ) is an important
shape-memory alloy. The shape-memory effect (SME)manifests itself when the alloy is deformed into a shape
while in a low-temperature martensitic condition but
regains its original shape when the stress is removedand it is heated above the martensitic regime. Strainsof the order of 8% can be completely recovered bythe reverse transformation of the deformed marten-sitic phase to the higher-temperature parent phase.The martensite transformation in these alloys is athermo-elastic martensitic transformation in which themartensite plates form and grow continuously as the
temperature is lowered and are removed reversibly as
the temperature is raised. NiTi was one of the orig-inal SME alloys, but there are many copper-basedalloys which undergo a martensitic transformation,e.g. Cu–17Zr–7Al. Application of SME alloys relieson the characteristic that they can change shape repeat-edly as a result of heating and cooling and exert a forceas the shape changes. By composition control (increas-ing the Ni content or substitution of Cu lowers the M
s
temperature of TiNi), the shape-memory can be trig-
gered by normal body temperature or any other conve-
nient temperature to operate a device. Several biomed-ical applications have been developed in orthopaedicdevices (e.g. pulling fractures together), in orthodon-tics, in intrauterine contraceptives and in artiﬁcialhearts. Industrial applications include pipe couplingsfor ships which shrink during heating, electrical con-nectors, servo-mechanisms for driving recording pens,switches, actuators and thermostats.

9.7 Aluminium alloys
9.7.1 Designation of aluminium alloys
Aluminium has an attractive combination of properties
(i.e. low density, strong, easy to fabricate) which canbe developed and modiﬁed by alloying and process-ing. The basic physical metallurgy has been outlined
in Chapter 8 and hence in this section some of the
alloys developed for particular industries such as thetransportation, construction, electrical and packagingindustries will be considered.
Aluminium alloys are identiﬁed by a four-digit sys-
tem
1based on the main alloying element. This is
summarized in Table 9.7. For wrought alloys the ﬁrst
digit identiﬁes the alloy group and the second digitany modiﬁcation to the original alloy which is iden-tiﬁed by the last two digits. The system is slightlydifferent for casting alloys. The ﬁrst digit again identi-
ﬁes the group, the second two digits identify the alloy
and the last digit, preceded by a decimal point, indi-cates the product form (i.e. 0 for casting and 1 foringot).
9.7.2 Applications of aluminium alloys
With the need for fuel economy and weight-saving,aluminium alloys are increasingly used in cars, and itstwo most important properties are density and thermal
conductivity. Over the past 15 years the aluminium
content of cars has increased from around 5% to 13%by both volume and weight. In engines they are usedfor pistons, cylinder heads and sumps. Al–Si cast-
ing alloys of the 3XX.X series are being used for
engine blocks and Al–Si pistons with cast iron cylin-der liners for wear resistance. The superior thermalconductivity reduces the volume of coolant in the
system. Aluminium wheels, vacuum-cast or forged,
are replacing conventional steel wheels in sports cars.

ﬁrst introduced by the Aluminium Association of the USA
and is now standard for wrought alloys.
2Alloy treatment is usually described by a sufﬁx letter and
digit system (e.g. F—as fabricated, O—annealed,H—work-hardening and T—heat -treated. Digits followingseries can be used for body sheet. However, the mod-
ulus of aluminium is only one-third that of steeland hence signiﬁcant design changes are necessaryto maintain rigidity and stiffness. A straightforwardincrease in gauge thickness would lead to a doublingcost which limits the replacement to ‘quality’ cars.For bulk market cars, gauge for gauge substitutionfor steel is a future objective with structural reinforce-ment to enhance body torsional characteristics. This ispossible with the use of adhesives in a weld-bondingapproach which can reduce the weight by half andfuel consumption and CO
2emission by almost 15%
Aluminium-structured vehicle technology (ASVT) islikely to be essential when emission control to reduceglobal warming effects is tightened.
The Honda NSX all-aluminium car
3is manufactured
with conventional design and assembly and has threedifferent 6000 series alloys for external panels and astructural subframe of 5182 alloy.
In aircraft construction use is made of the high
strength-density ratio of the Al–Cu (2000 series)and Al–Zn–Mg (7000 series) alloys in extrudedform for wing spars, fuselage and landing gear andfor the skin in plate or sheet form; typically 7075(5.6Zn–2.5Mg–1.6Cu) is used in the T6 condition and2024 (4.4Cu–1.5Mg–0.6Mn) in the T3 or T8 con-ditions. The alloys of the 7000 series have higherstrength than the 2000 alloys but lower resistanceto fracture. However, higher-purity levels (e.g. 2124alloy), give enhanced toughness. Alloys of both serieslose strength above 100
°C and are thus not suitable
for supersonic aircraft. The RR58 alloy used for the
Concorde at temperatures up to 175 °C was originally
an early engine material, for compressor blades and
impellers.
Aluminium is used extensively in the construction
industry because of its light weight, resistance toatmospheric attack and surface ﬁnish. For decorativeapplications, dyed anodic ﬁlms produce a permanentdurable ﬁnish. Generally, the Al–Mg–Si 6000 series
H specify the work-hardened condition, and that following T

and artiﬁcially aged, T4 solu tion heat-treated and naturally
aged, T3 solution heat-tr eated and cold-worked).

is used, i.e. 6063 medium-strength and 6082 higher-
strength alloys in the T6 condition for extrusions or
T4 where forming is required during fabrication. The
Al–Cu (2014A) alloy is also used for heavily-loaded
primary structures.
The packaging industry also provides a large market
for aluminium alloys. The main requirement is for low-
cost, simple alloys capable of being formed and the
Al–Mg (5000) series is often used. Impurity control is
essential and liquid metal ﬁltering is necessary in the
production of thin sheet.
In the electrical industry, electrical conductivity
grade aluminium and higher-strength 5000 and 6000
series alloys are used for transmission lines, replacing
the more expensive copper. Dispersion-strengthened
alloys containing a ﬁne dislocation substructure sta-
bilized by small precipitates are used for electricalwiring.
9.7.3 Aluminium-lithium alloys
The advantages of aluminium-lithium alloys have
been known for a long time but lower density and
increased elastic stiffness were offset by poor ductil-
ity and fracture performance. Basic Al–Li alloys pre-
cipitate the ⊿Al3Li/triangleleftυ0, a spherical ordered precipitate.
Precipitation-hardening leads, however, to localized
deformation with limited cross-slip and poor fracturebehaviour. Additions of copper to the alloy so that the
Li/Cu ratio is high leads to the formation of both υ
0and
aT1phase ⊿Al2CuLi/triangleleft. This gives some improvement
in fracture toughness by independent control of the two
precipitates. In the quaternary system Al–Li–Cu–Mgthe S-phase precipitates in addition to the υ
0and
T1. The S-phase is better at dispersing slip than T1
and with adjustment of composition can be made to
dominate the structure. Both S and T1are nucleated
heterogeneously on dislocations and the best resultsare obtained by cold-working the alloy after solution-
treatment.
Commercial alloys based on this background are
Lital A, B andCwhich have been developed to
match the (1) conventional medium-strength 2014-T6, (2) high-strength 7075-T6 and (3) damage-tolerant
2024-T3 alloys, with a 10% reduction in density and
10% improvement in stiffness (see Table 9.8).
Lital A in T6 sheet form typically has 365 MN m
/NUL2
0.2% proof stress, 465 MN m/NUL2TS, 6% elongation,
66 MN m/NUL3/2fracture toughness, an elastic modulus
of 80 GN m/NUL2and density of 2550 kg m/NUL3.Lital B
has roughly 10% improvement in strength. Lital C is a

variant of the 8090 alloy and is heat-treated to increase
toughness ( ¾76 MN m/NUL3/2) at the expense of strength
(TS¾440 MN m/NUL2).
Lithium additions are also being made to conven-
tional aluminium alloys. The addition of lithium hasa major inﬂuence since Li possesses a signiﬁcant
vacancy binding energy of about 0.25 eV. Lithium
atoms therefore trap vacancies and form Li-V aggre-gates. This decreases the concentration of mobile
vacancies available for the transport of zone-forming
atoms, and therefore inhibits the diffusion of Zn and
Mg in 7075, and Si and Mg in 6061, into zones.
Second, the Li-V aggregates, very probably presentduring quenching and immediately after ageing, act as
heterogeneous sites for subs equent clustering of zone-
forming atoms during ageing.
Additions of Li into either Al–2Mg–0.6Si–0.3Cu–
0.3Cr (6061) or Al–5.9Zn–2.4Mg–1.7Cu (7075)modify the precipitation scheme and age-hardening
behaviour of the original alloys. The precipitates
which form in the base alloys are inhibited or evensuppressed. For the 6061 the addition of 0.7% Li
retards the precipitation of needle-shaped GP zones
and produces a ternary compound AlLiSi, whereas
the addition of 2.0% Li results in the dominant
precipitation of υ
0and extremely delayed and limited
formation of needle-shaped GP zones and AlLiSi. For
7075 the addition of 0.7% Li alters the conventional
precipitation scheme from solute-rich GP zone !
/DC10!/DC1MgZn2into vacancy-rich GP zone !T0!
T⊿AlZn /triangleleft49Mg32, whereas the addition of 2.0% Li
produces the dominant υ0precipitate and limited and
delayed formation of T-phase. As a result, the age-hardening response relating to these major hardening
phases in both base alloys is delayed or decreased.
Such additions can produce narrower PFZ’s and give
improved fracture properties.
A further commercial alloy is UL40, which is essen-
tially a binary alloy containing 4% Li. The alloy is
cast using a spray-deposition process resulting in a
ﬁne-grained microstructure, with uniform distributionof second phase, free from oxide. The high Li con-
tent alloy has a very low density ⊿2400 kg m
/NUL3/triangleleftand
is almost a third lighter than conventional aluminium
and magnesium alloys. It extrudes well and can be
welded with Al–Mg–Zr ﬁller, producing componentsfor aircraft and helicopters, such as pump housings
and valves, and for yachting with good corrosion
resistance.
9.7.4 Processing developments
9.7.4.1 Superplastic aluminium alloys
Superplastic forming is a cost-effective manufactur-
ing process for producing both simple and complexshapes from aluminium alloy sheet, because of its
low-cost tooling and short lead times for produc-
tion. A range of alloys is available including 2004
(Al–6Cu–0.4Zr) or Supral, 5083 SPF, 7475 SPF and
Lital 8090 SPF (Al–Li–Mg–Cu). Supral and Lital
318 Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
dynamically recrystallize to a ﬁne grain size during the
early stages of deformation ( ¾500 °C) which is stabi-
lized with ZrAl 3particles. The grain size in 7475 is
stabilized by TMP and submicron Cr particles and, in5083, by a Mn-dispersoid. Components are formed byclamping the alloy sheet in a pressure chamber andthen applying gas or air pressure to force the sheetslowly into contact with a tool surface; both the tooland sheet are maintained at the forming temperature
throughout the process. During normal superplastic
forming, the alloys tend to develop voiding. This voidformation is minimized by forming in hydrostatic con-ditions by introducing a gas pressure on both the frontand back surfaces of the sheet being formed. The sheetis forced against the tool surface with a small pressuredifferential.
9.7.4.2 Rapid solidiﬁcation processing of
aluminium alloys
Rapid solidiﬁcation processing (RSP) has been applied
to aluminium alloys to produce a ﬁne grain size andextend solid solubility, particularly for the transition
metals, iron, molybdenum, chromium and zirconium,
which usually have low solid solubility and low diffu-sion rates in aluminium. Interestingly RSP alloys con-taining Fe and Cr, on annealing, precipitate metastablespherical quasi-crystals of icosahedral phase with ﬁve-fold symmetry. These are extremely stable and hardlycoarsen after extensive heat-treatment which indicatesa potential for alloy development.
A series of commercially-available high-temperature
Al–Fe–V–Si alloys has been developed and consistof very ﬁne, spherical Al
13⊿FeV/triangleleft3Si silicides uni-
formly dispersed throughout the matrix which display
much slower coarsening rates than other dispersoids.
A typical alloy with 27 vol.% silicides is 8009
(Al–8.5Fe–1.3V–1.7Si) and, without any needle or
platelet precipitates in the microstructure, has a K1c
¾29 MN m/NUL3/2. The tensile properties as a function of
temperature are shown in Figure 9.17 in comparison
with a conventional 7075-T6 alloy. At all tempera-
t u r e su pt o4 8 0 °C, the 8009 alloy has a higher speciﬁc
stiffness than a Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The fatigue and
creep rupture properties are better than conventional
aluminium alloys with excellent corrosion resistance.
These RSP silicide alloys can be readily fabricated
into sheet, extruded or forged and the combination ofattractive properties makes them serious candidates for
aerospace applications. Other alloys developed include
Al–Cr–Zn–Mn, Al–8Fe–2Mo and Al–Li.
9.7.4.3 Mechanical alloys of aluminium
Mechanical alloys of aluminium contain dispersionsof carbides or oxides, which not only produce disper-
sion strengthening but also stabilize a ﬁne-grain struc-
ture. An advantage of these alloys arises because thestrength is derived from the dispersoids and thus the
composition of the alloy matrix can be designed prin-
cipally for corrosion resistance and toughness ratherthan strength. Thus the alloying elements which are
usually added to conventional aluminium alloys for
precipitation-strengthening and grain size control may
be unnecessary.
Mechanical alloying is carried out with elemental
powders and an organic process control agent, such as
Figure 9.17 Tensile properties of RSP Al alloy 8009 as a function of t emperature compared with conventional aluminium
alloys (from Gilman, 1990, p. 505) .
Modern alloy developments 319
stearic acid, to balance the cold-welding and powder
fracture processes. No dispersoid is added because the
oxide on the surface of the powders and process control
agent are consolidated during mechanical alloying ashydrated oxides and carbonates. The process producesa ﬁne dispersion of ¾20 nm particles in a dynamically-
recrystallized structure with grains as ﬁne as 0 .05
µm.
Subsequent vacuum degassing at elevated tempera-ture removes the H
2and N 2liberated, improves the
homogenization of the matrix and reduces carbonatesto Al
4C3which forms most of the dispersoid. The ﬁnal
grain size is around 0 .1µm. The powder is then com-
pacted by HIPing, or vacuum hot-pressing and conven-tionally extruded to produce a material with a stablegrain size of 0 .3
µm, with grain boundaries pinned by
the dispersoid.
Mechanical alloys have been developed correspond-
ing to the 2000, 5000 and 7000 aluminium seriesalloy. IN-9021 is heat-treatable by solution treatment
and natural or elevated-temperature ageing to give
500–560 MN m

sections; 390 MN m

Ceramics and glasses
10.1 Classiﬁcation of ceramics
The term ceramic, in its modern context, covers
an extremely broad range of inorganic materials;
they contain non-metallic and metallic elements and
are produced by a wide variety of manufacturingtechniques. Traditionally, ceramics are moulded from
silicate minerals, such as clays, dried and ﬁred at tem-
peratures of 1200–1800
°C to give a hard ﬁnish. Thus
we can readily see that the original Greek word ker-
amos, meaning ‘burned stuff’ or ‘kiln-ﬁred material’,
has long been directly appropriate. Modern ceramics,
however, are often made by processes that do not
involve a kiln-ﬁring step (e.g. hot-pressing, reaction-
sintering, glass-devitriﬁcation, etc.). Although ceram-
ics are sometimes said to be non-metallic in character,
this simple distinction from metals and alloys hasbecome increasingly inadequate and arbitrary as new
ceramics with unusual properties are developed and
come into use.
Ceramics may be generally classiﬁed, according
to type or function, in various ways. In industrial
terms, they may be listed as pottery, heavy clay prod-
ucts (bricks, earthenware pipes, etc.), refractories (ﬁre-
bricks, silica, alumina, basic, neutral), cement and
concrete, glasses and vitreous enamels, and engineer-
ing (technical, ﬁne) ceramics. Members of the ﬁnal
group are capable of very high strength and hardness,exceptionalchemicalstabilityandcanbemanufactured
to very close dimensional tolerances. These will be
our prime concern. Their introduction as engineering
components in recent years has been based upon con-
siderable scientiﬁc effort and has revolutionized engi-
neering design practice. In general, the development
of engineering ceramics has been stimulated by the
drive towards higher, more energy-efﬁcient, process
temperatures and foreseeable shortages of strategicminerals. In contrast to traditional ceramics, which
use naturally-occurring and, inevitably, rather variable
minerals, the new generation of engineering ceramicsdepends upon the availability of puriﬁed and synthe-
sized materials and upon close microstructural controlduring processing. Ceramics are subject to variabilityin their properties and statistical concepts often needto be incorporated into design procedures for stressedcomponents. Design must recognize the inherent brit-tleness, or low resistance to crack propagation, andmodify, if necessary, the mode of failure. Ceramics,because of their unique properties, show great promiseas engineering materials but, in practice, their produc-tion on a commercial scale in speciﬁed forms withrepeatable properties is often beset with many pro-blems.
Using chemical composition as a basis, it is possible
to classify ceramics into ﬁve main categories:
1.Oxides—a l u m i n a ,A l
2O3(spark plug insulators,
grinding wheel grits), magnesia, MgO (refrac-tory linings of furnaces, crucibles), zirconia,ZrO
2(piston caps, refractory lining of glass
tank furnaces), zirconia/alumina (grinding media),
spinels, M2CO.M3C
2O3(ferrites, magnets, transis-
tors, recording tape), ‘fused’ silica glass (laboratoryware),
2.Carbides — silicon carbide, SiC (chemical plant,
crucibles, ceramic armour), silicon nitride, Si
3N4
(spouts for molten aluminium, high-temperaturebearings), boron nitride, BN (crucibles, grindingwheels for high-strength steels).
3.Silicates— porcelain(electricalcomponents),steat-
ites (insulators), mullite (refractories).
4.Sialons— based on Si–Al–O–N and M–Si–Al–
O–NwhereM DLi, Be, Mg, Ca, Sc, Y, rare earths
(tool inserts for high-speed cutting, extrusion dies,turbine blades).
5.Glass-ceramics —Pyroceram, Cercor, Pyrosil (re-
cuperator discs for heat exchangers).
The preceding two methods of classifying ceramics,
industrial and chemical, are of very little use to thematerials scientist and technologist, who is primarily
Ceramics and glasses 321
concerned with structure/property relations. One can
predict that a ceramic structure with a ﬁne grain (crys-
tal) size and low porosity is likely to offer advantagesof mechanical strength and impermeability to contact-ing ﬂuids. It is therefore scientiﬁcally appropriate toclassify ceramic materials in microstructural terms, inthe following manner:
1. Single crystals of appreciable size (e.g. ruby laser
crystal)
2. Glass (non-crystalline) of appreciable size (e.g.
sheets of ‘ﬂoat’ glass)
3. Crystalline or glassy ﬁlaments (e.g. E-glass for
glass-reinforced polymers, single-crystal ‘whis-
kers’, silica glass in Space Shuttle tiles)
4. Polycrystalline aggregates bonded by a glassy
matrix (e.g. porcelain pottery, silica refractories,hot-pressed silicon nitride)
5. Glass-free polycrystalline aggregates (e.g. ultra-
pure,ﬁne-grained,‘zero-porosity’formsofalumina,magnesia and beryllia)
6. Polycrystalline aggregates produced by heat-
treating glasses of special composition (e.g. glass-ceramics)
7. Composites(e.g. siliconcarbideorcarbonﬁlaments
in a matrix of glass or glass-ceramic, magnesia-
graphite refractories, concrete).
This approach to classifying ceramics places the
necessary emphasis upon the crystalline and non-crystalline (glassy) attributes of the ceramic body, thesigniﬁcance of introducing grain boundary surfacesand the scope for deliberately mixing two phases withvery different properties.
10.2 General properties of ceramics
The constituent atoms in a ceramic are held togetherby very strong bonding forces which may be ionic,covalent or a mixture of the two. As a direct conse-quence, their melting points are often very high, mak-ing them eminently suited for use in energy-intensivesystems such as industrial furnaces and gas turbines.For instance, alumina primarily owes its importanceas a furnace refractory material to its melting point of2050
°C. The type of inter-atomic bonding is respon-
sible for the relatively low electrical conductivity of
ceramics. For general applications they are usuallyregarded as excellent electrical insulators, having nofree electrons. However, ion mobility becomes signif-
icant at temperatures above 500–600
°C and they then
become progressively more conductive. This propertycan prove a problem in electric furnaces.
The strength of ceramics under compressive stress-
ing is excellent; accordingly, designers of ceramic
artefacts as different as arches in buildings and metal-
cutting tool tips ensure that the forces during serviceare essentially compressive. In contrast, the tensilestrength of ceramics is not exceptional, sometimes
poor, largely because of the weakening effect of sur-
face ﬂaws. Thus, in some cases, glazing with a thinvitreous layer can seal surface cracks and improvethe tensile strength. The strength of ceramics is com-monlyexpressedasamodulusofrupture(MoR)value,
obtained from three-point bend tests, because in the
moreconventionaltypeoftestwithuniaxialloading,asusedfor metals, is difﬁculttoapplywithperfect uniax-iality; a slight misalignment of the machine grips willinduce unwanted bending stresses. Ceramics are gen-
erally regarded as brittle, non-ductile materials, with
little or no plastic deformation of the microstructureeither before or at fracture. For this reason, whichrules out the types of production processes involv-
ing deformation that are so readily applied to metals
and polymers, ceramic production frequently centreson the manipulation and ultimate bonding together ofﬁnepowders.Theinherentlackofductilityimpliesthatceramics are likely to have a better resistance to slow
plastic deformation at very high temperatures (creep)
than metals.
The modulus of elasticity of ceramics can be excep-
tionally high (Table 10.1). This modulus expresses
stiffness, or the amount of stress necessary to pro-
duce unit elastic strain, and, like strength, is a primarydesign consideration. However, it is the combinationof low density with this stiffness that makes ceramicsparticularly attractive for structures in which weight
reduction is a prime consideration.
In aircraft gas turbines, ceramic blades have long
been an interesting proposition because, apart fromreducingthetotalmassthathastobelevitated,theyare

subject to lower centrifugal forces than metallic ver-
sions.It istherefore common practice to appraise com-
petitor materials for aircraft in terms of their speciﬁcmoduli, in which the modulus of elasticity is dividedbydensity.Ceramicsconsistlargelyofelementsoflowatomic mass, hence their bulk density is usually low,
typically about 2000–4000 kg m
/NUL3. Ceramics such as
densealuminaaccordinglytendtobecomepre-eminent
in listings of speciﬁc moduli (Table 10.1).
The strong interatomic bonding means that ceram-
ics are hard as well as strong. That is, they resistpenetration by scratching or indentation and are poten-tially suited for use as wear-resistant bearings and as
abrasiveparticlesfor metal removal. Generally,impact
conditions should be avoided. Interestingly, shape caninﬂuence performance; thus, the curved edges of din-ner plates are carefully designed to maximize resis-tance to chipping. Although the strength and hardness
of materials are often related in a relatively simple
manner, it is unwise to assume that a hard material,whether metallic or ceramic, will necessarily prove tobe wear-resistant. Grinding of ceramics is possible,albeit costly. Strength can be enhanced in this way
but great care is necessary as there is a risk that the
machiningoperationwilldamage, rather thanimprove,the critical surface texture.
During the consolidation and densiﬁcation of a
‘green’ powder compact in a typical ﬁring operation,
sintering of the particles gradually reduces the amount
of pore space between contiguous grains. The ﬁnalporosity, by volume, of the ﬁred material ranges from30% to nearly zero. Together with grain size, it hasa direct inﬂuence upon the modulus of rupture; thus,
bone china, because of its ﬁner texture, is twice as
strong as ﬁred earthenware. Pore spaces, particularly ifinterconnected, also lower the resistance of a ceramicstructure to penetration by a pervasive ﬂuid such as
molten slag. On the other hand, deliberate encourage-
ment of porosity, say 25–30% by volume, is usedto lower the thermal conductivity of insulating re-fractories.
Ceramics are often already in their highest state
of oxidation. Not surprisingly, they often exhibit low
chemical reactivity when exposed to hot oxidizingenvironments. Their refractoriness, or resistance todegradation and collapse during service at high tem-peratures, stems from the strong interatomic bonding.
However, operational temperatures are subject to sud-
denexcursionsandtheresultingsteepgradientsoftem-perature withintheceramic bodycan give rise tostressimbalances. As the ceramic is essentially non-ductile,stresses are not relieved by plastic deformation and
cracking may occur in planes roughly perpendicular
to the temperature gradient, with portions of ceramicbecoming detached from the hottest face. The sever-ity of this disintegration, known as spalling, dependsmainly upon thermal expansivity ( ˛) and conductivity
(k).Silicahasapoorresistancetospallingwhereassili-
connitridecanwithstandbeingheatedtoatemperatureof 1000
°C and then quenched in cold water.The ability of certain ceramic oxides to exist in
either crystalline or non-crystalline forms has beencommented upon previously. Silica and boric oxidepossess this ability. In glass-ceramics, a metastableglass of special composition is shaped while in theviscous condition, then heat-treated in order to inducenucleation and growth of a ﬁne, completely crystallinestructure. (This manipulation and exploitation of thecrystalline and glassy states is also practised withmetals and polymers.) This glass-forming potential isan important aspect of ceramic science. The propertyof transparency to light is normally associated with
glasses, notably with the varieties based upon silica.
However, transparency is not conﬁned to glasses andsingle crystals. It is possible to produce some oxides,normally regarded as opaque, in transparent, polycrys-talline forms (e.g. hot-pressed magnesia).
So far as sources in the earth’s crust are concerned,
mineral reserves for ceramic production are relativelyplentiful. While one might observe that important con-stituent elements such as silicon, oxygen and nitrogenare outstandingly abundant, it must also be recognizedthat the processes for producing the new ceramics canbe very costly, demanding resort to highly specialized
equipment and exacting process control.
10.3 Production of ceramic powders
The wide-ranging properties and versatility of mod-
ern engineering ceramics owe much to the ways inwhich they are manufactured. A ﬁne powder is usuallythe starting material, or precursor; advanced ceram-ics are mainly produced from powders with a sizerange of 1–10
µm. Electrical properties are extremely
structure-sensitive and there is a strong demand fromthe electronics industry for even ﬁner particles (in thenanometre range). The basic purpose of the manufac-turing process is to bring particle surfaces together andto develop strong interparticle bonds. It follows thatspeciﬁcsurfacearea,expressedperunitmass,isofpar-
ticular signiﬁcance. Characterization of the powder in
terms of its physical and chemical properties, such assize distribution,shape, surface topography, purity andreactivity,isanessentialpreliminarytotheactualman-ufacturingprocess.Tolerancesandlimitsare becomingmore and more exacting.
The three principal routes for producing high-grade
powders are based upon solid-state reactions, solutionand vaporization. The solid-state reaction route, longexempliﬁed by the Acheson process for siliconcarbide(Section 10.4.5.2), involves high temperatures. It isused in more reﬁned forms for the production of
other carbides (TiC, WC), super-conductive oxides
and silicon nitride. An aggregate is produced and thenecessary size reduction (comminution) introduces therisk of contamination. Furthermore, as has long beenknown in mineral-dressing industries, ﬁne grinding isenergy-intensive and costly.
Ceramics and glasses 323
The Bayer process for converting bauxite into alu-
mina is a solution-treatment method. In this impor-
tant process, which will be examined in detail later
(Section 10.4.1.2), aluminium hydroxide is precipi-
tated from a caustic solution and then converted toalumina by heating. Unfortunately, this calcination has
a sintering effect and ﬁne grinding of the resultant
agglomerate is necessary. In the more recent spray-dryingandspray-roastingtechniques,whicharewidely
used to produce oxide powders, sprayed droplets of
concentrated solutions of appropriate salts are rapidlyheated by a stream of hot gas. Again, there is a risk of
agglomeration and grinding is often necessary.
These difﬁculties, which stem from the inherent
physical problem of removing all traces of solvent in a
satisfactory manner, have encouraged development ofmethods based upon a ‘solution-to-gelation’ (sol–gel)
approach. The three key stages of a typical sol–gel
process are:
1. Production of a colloidal suspension or solution
(sol) (e.g. concentrated solution of metallic salt in
dilute acid)
2. Adjustment of pH, addition of a gelling agent,
evaporation of liquid to produce a gel
3. Carefully controlled calcination to produce ﬁne
particles of ceramic.
Sol–gel methods are applicable to both ceramics and
glasses and are capable of producing ﬁlaments aswell as powders. One variant involves hydrolysis
of distillation-puriﬁed alkoxides (formed by reacting
metal oxides with alcohol). The hydroxide particles
precipitated from the sol are spherical, uniform in
shape and sub-micron sized. Sintering does not drasti-cally change these desirable characteristics. Although
costs tend to be high and processing times are lengthy,
sol–gel methods offer an attractive way to produceoxide powders, such as alumina, zirconia and titania,
that will ﬂow, form and sinter readily and give a prod-
uct with superior properties. Currently, there is greatinterest in vapour phase methods that enable pow-
ders with a particle size as small as 10–20 nm to
be produced (e.g. oxides, carbides, nitrides, silicides,
borides). The high-energy input required for vaporiza-
tion is provided by electric arcs, plasma jets or laserbeams. The powder is condensed within a carrier gas
and then separated from the gas stream by impinge-
ment ﬁlters or electrostatic precipitators. Sometimes,in a chemical vapour deposition process (CVD), a thin
ﬁlm is condensed directly upon a substrate.
The manufacture of an advanced ceramic usually
involves a number of steps, or unit operations. Each
operation is subject to a number of interacting vari-
ables (time, temperature, pressure, etc.) and, by having
a very speciﬁc effect upon the developing structure
(macro- and micro-), makes its individual contributionto the ﬁnal quality of the product. When ductile met-
als are shaped by plastic deformation, each operation
stresses the material and is likely to reveal ﬂaws. (Forinstance, the ability of an austenitic stainless steel to
be cold-drawn to the dimensions of a ﬁne hypodermic
needle tube is strong evidence of structural integrity.)
Individual ceramic particles are commonly brittle and
non-deformable; consequently, manufacturing routesusually avoid plastic deformation and there is a greater
inherent risk that ﬂaws will survive processing without
becoming visible or causing actual disintegration. The
ﬁnal properties of an advanced ceramic are extremely
sensitive to any form of structural heterogeneity. Thedevelopmentofspecialceramicsandhighly-innovative
production techniques has encouraged greater use of
non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques at keypoints in the manufacturing programme. At the design
stage, guidelines of the following type are advisedly
applied to the overall plan of production:
1. Precursor materials, particularly ultra-ﬁne powders,
should be scientiﬁcally characterized.
2. Each and every unit operation should be closely
studied and controlled.
3. NDE techniques should be carefully integrated
within the overall scheme of operations.
10.4 Selected engineering ceramics
10.4.1 Alumina
10.4.1.1 General properties and applications of
alumina
Alumina is the most widely used of the twenty or so
oxide ceramics and is often regarded as the historic
forerunnerofmodernengineeringceramics. Theactualcontent of alumina, reported as Al
2O3, ranges from
85% to 99.9%, depending upon the demands of the
application.
Alumina-based refractories of coarse grain size are
used in relatively massive forms such as slabs, shapesand bricks for furnace construction. Alumina has a
high melting point (2050
°C) and its heat resistance,
or refractoriness, has long been appreciated by fur-nace designers. In fact, there has been a trend for
aluminosilicate refractories (based upon clays) to be
replaced by more costly high-alumina materials and
high-purityalumina.Interatomicbondingforces,partly
ionic and partly covalent, are extremely strong and thecrystal structure of alumina is physically stable up to
temperatures of 1500–1700
°C. It is used for protec-
tive sheaths for temperature-measuring thermocouples
which have to withstand hot and aggressive environ-
ments and for ﬁlters which remove foreign particlesand oxide dross from fast-moving streams of molten
aluminium prior to casting. Large refractory blocks
cast from fused alumina are used to line furnaces formelting glass. However, although alumina is a heat-
resisting material with useful chemical stability, it is
more sensitive to thermal shock than silicon carbide
and silicon nitride. A contributory factor is its rela-
tively high linear coefﬁcient of thermal expansion ⊿˛/triangleleft.
324Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
The respective ˛-values /ð10/NUL6K/NUL1for silicon car-
bide, silicon nitride and alumina are 8, 4.5 and 3.5.
When intended for use as engineering components
atlowertemperatures,aluminaceramicsusuallyhavea
ﬁnegrainsize(0.5–20 µm)andvirtuallyzeroporosity.
Developmentofalumina tomeet increasinglystringentdemandshastakenplacecontinuouslyovermanyyears
and has focused mainly upon controlof chemical com-
position and grain structure. The chemical inertnessof alumina and its biocompatibility with human tissuehave led to its use for hip prostheses. An oft-quoted
example of the capabilities of alumina is the insulat-
ing body of the spark-ignition plug for petrol-fuelledengines (Figure 10.1). Its design and fabrication meth-
ods have been steadily evolving since the early 1900s.
In modern engines, trouble-free functioning of a plugdepends primarily upon the insulating capability ofits isostatically-pressed alumina body. Each plug is
expected to withstand temperatures up to 1000
°C, sud-
den mechanical pressures, corrosive exhaust gases andapotentialdifferenceofabout30 kVwhile‘ﬁring’pre-
cisely 50–100 times per second over long periods of
time. Plugs are provided with a smooth glazed (glassy)surface so that any electrically-conductive ﬁlm of con-tamination can be easily removed.
The exceptional insulating properties and range of
alumina ceramics have long been recognized in theelectrical and electronics industries (e.g. substrates for
circuitry, sealed packaging for semiconductor micro-
circuits). Unlike metals, there are no ‘free’ electronsavailable in the structure to form a ﬂow of current.The dielectric strength, which is a measure of the abil-
ity of a material to withstand a gradient of electric
potentialwithoutbreakdownordischarge,isveryhigh.Even at temperatures approaching 1000
°C, when the
atoms tend to become mobile and transport some elec-
trical charge, the resistivity is still signiﬁcantly high.Electrical properties usually beneﬁt when the purity ofalumina is improved.
Many mass-produced engineering components take
advantage of the excellent compressive strength, hard-ness and wear resistance of alumina (e.g. rotatingseals in washing machines and in water pumps for
automobile engines, machine jigs and cutting tools,
soil-penetrating coulters on agricultural equipment,shaftbearingsinwatchesandtape-recordingmachines,
guides for fast-moving ﬁbres and yarns, grinding
abrasives). (Emery, the well-known abrasive, is animpure anhydrous form of alumina which containsas much as 20% SiO
2CFe2O3; pretreatment is often
unnecessary.) The constituent atoms in alumina, alu-
minium and oxygen,are of relativelylow mass and the
correspondingly low density (3800 kg m/NUL3)i so f t e n
advantageous. However, like most ceramics, alumina
is brittle and should not be subjected to either impactblows or excessive tensile stresses during service.
Alumina components are frequently quite small but
theirfunctioningcanvitallyaffecttheperformance and
overall efﬁciency of a much larger engineeringsystem.

10.4.1.2 Preparation and shaping of alumina
powders
Examination of the general form of the production
route for alumina ceramics from ore to ﬁnished shape
provides an insight into some of the important factorsand working principles which guide the ceramics tech-
nologist and an indication of the specialized shaping
methods that are available for ceramics. As mentioned
earlier, each stage of the production sequence makes
its own individual and vital contribution to the ﬁnal
qualityoftheproductandmustbecarefullycontrolled.
The principal raw material for alumina production
is bauxite Al
2O(OH) 4, an abundant hydrated rock
occurring as large deposits in various parts of the

world.2In the Bayer process, prepared bauxitic ore
is digested under pressure in a hot aqueous solution
of sodium hydroxide and then ‘seeded’ to induce pre-
cipitation of Al(OH)3crystals, usually referred to by
the mineral term ‘gibbsite’. (The conditions of time,
temperature, agitation, etc. during this stage greatly
inﬂuence the quality of the Bayer product.) Gibbsite
is chemically decomposed by heating (calcined) at a
temperature of 1200 °C. Bayer calcine, which consists
of˛-alumina ( >99% Al 2O3), is graded according to
the nature and amount of impurities. Sodium oxide,
Na2O, ranges up to 0.6% and is of special signiﬁ-
cance because it affects sintering behaviour and elec-
trical resistance. The calcine consists of agglomerates
of˛-alumina crystallites which can be varied in aver-
age size from 0.5 to 100 µm by careful selection of
calcining conditions.
Bayer calcine is commonly used by manufactur-
ers to produce high-purity alumina components as
well as numerous varieties of lower-grade components
containing 85–95% Al 2O3. For the latter group, the
composition of the calcine is debased by additions
of oxides such as SiO 2, CaO and MgO which act as
ﬂuxes, forming a ﬂuid glassy phase between the grains
of˛-alumina during sintering.
The chosen grade of alumina, together with any
necessary additives, is ground in wet ball-mills to
a speciﬁed size range. Water is removed by spray-ing the aqueous suspension into a ﬂow of hot gas
(spray-drying) and separating the alumina in a cyclone
unit. The free-ﬂowing powder can be shaped by a
variety of methods (e.g. dry, isostatic-or hot-pressing,
slip- or tape-casting, roll-forming, extrusion, injection-
moulding). Extremely high production rates are often
possible; for instance, a machine using air pres-
sure to compress dry powder isostatically in ﬂexible
rubber moulds (‘bags’) can produce 300–400 spark
plug bodies per hour. In some processes, binders
are incorporated with the powder; for instance, athermoplastic can be hot-mixed with alumina powder
to facilitate injection-moulding and later burned off. In
tape-casting, which produces thin substrates for micro-
electronic circuits, alumina powder is suspended in an
organic liquid.
10.4.1.3 Densiﬁcation by sintering
The fragile and porous ‘green’ shapes are ﬁnally ﬁredin kilns (continuous or intermittent). Firing is a costlyprocess and, wherever possible, there has been a natu-
ral tendency to reduce the length of the time cycle for
small components. Faster rates of cooling after ‘soak-
ing’ at the maximum temperature have been found to
give a ﬁner, more desirable grain structure.
2Long-distance transportation costs have prompted
investigation of alternative sources. For instance, roastedkaolinite can be leached in concentrated hydrochloric orsulphuric acid, then precipitated as an aluminium salt whichis calcined to form alumina.It has been mentioned that ﬂuxing oxides are added
tolower-gradealuminasinordertoformanintergranu-lar phase(s). Althoughthis ﬂuid inter-granular material
facilitates densiﬁcation during ﬁring, its presence in
the ﬁnal product can have a detrimental effect upon
strength and resistance to chemical attack. As a con-
sequence, powders of high alumina content are chosen
for demanding applications. In general, an increase in
alumina content from 88% to 99.8% requires a corre-
spondingincreaseinﬁringtemperaturefrom1450
°Cto
1750°C.‘Harder’ﬁringincursheavierenergycostsand
has led to the development of reactive alumina which
has an extremely small particle size (1 µm) and a large
speciﬁc surface. ‘Softer’ ﬁring temperatures became
possible with this grade of alumina and the need to
debase the alumina with relatively large amounts of
additives was challenged.
Shrinkage is the most apparent physical change
to take place when a ‘green’ ceramic compact is
ﬁred. The linear shrinkage of alumina is about 20%and dimensions may vary by up to š1%. Diamond
machining is used when greater precision is needed
but requires care as it may damage the surface and
introduce weakening ﬂaws.
10.4.2 From silicon nitride to sialons
10.4.2.1 Reaction-bonded silicon nitride
(RBSN)
Siliconnitride,whichcanbeproducedinseveralways,
hasfoundapplicationunderavarietyofdifﬁcultcondi-
tions(e.g.cuttingtools,bearings,heatengines,foundry
equipment, furnace parts, welding jigs, metal-working
dies, etc.). Its original development was largely stimu-
lated by the search for improved materials for gas tur-
bines. Prior to its development in the 1950s, the choiceof fabrication techniques for ceramics was restricted
and it was difﬁcult to produce complex ceramic shapes
to close dimensional tolerances. The properties avail-
able from existing materials were variable and speciﬁc
service requirements, such as good resistance to ther-
mal shock and attack by molten metal and/or slag,
could not be met. The development of silicon nitride
minimized these problems; it has also had a profound
effect upon engineering thought and practice.
Silicon nitride exists in two crystalline forms ⊿˛, ˇ/triangleleft:
both belong to the hexagonal system. Bonding is pre-
dominantly covalent. Silicon nitride was ﬁrst produced
byan innovativeform of pressurelesssintering.First,a
fragile pre-form of silicon powder (mainly ˛-Si
3N4)i s
prepared, usingone of a wide variety of forming meth-
ods (e.g die-pressing, isostatic-pressing, slip-casting,
ﬂame-spraying, polymer-assisted injection-moulding,
extrusion). In the ﬁrst stage of a reaction-bonding pro-cess, this pre-form is heated in a nitrogen atmosphere
and the following chemical reaction takes place:
3SiC2N
2DSi3N4
326Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
A reticular network of reaction product forms through-
out the mass, bonding the particles together with-
out liquefaction. Single crystal ‘whiskers’ of ˛-silicon
nitride also nucleate and grow into pore space. Reac-
tion is strongly exothermic and close temperature con-trol is necessary in order to prevent degradation of
the silicon. The resultant nitrided compact is strong
enough to withstand conventional machining. In thesecond and ﬁnal stage of nitridation, the component
is heated in nitrogen at a temperature of 1400
°C,
forming more silicon nitride in situand producing a
slightadditionalchange indimensionsofless than1%.
(Alumina articles can change by nearly 10% duringﬁring.) The ﬁnal microstructure consists of ˛-Si
3N4
(60–90%), ˇ-Si3N4(10–40%), unreacted silicon and
porosity (15–30%). As with most ceramics, ﬁring isthe most costly stage of production.
The ﬁnal product, reaction-bonded silicon nitride
(RBSN), has a bulk density of 2400–2600 kg m
/NUL3.
It is strong, hard and has excellent resistance to wear,thermal shock and attack by many destructive ﬂuids
(molten salts, slags, aluminium, lead, tin, zinc, etc.).
Its modulus of elasticity is high.
10.4.2.2 Hot-pressed forms of silicon nitride
(HPSN, HIPSN)
Intheearly1960s,agreaterdegreeofdensiﬁcationwas
achieved with the successful production of hot-pressedsiliconnitride(HPSN)byG. G. Deeleyandco-workers
at the Plessey Co. UK. Silicon nitride powder, which
cannot be consolidated by solid-state sintering alone,is mixed with one or more ﬂuxing oxides (magne-
sia, yttria, alumina) and compressed at a pressure of
23 MN m
/NUL2within radio-frequency induction-heated
graphite dies at temperatures up to 1850 °C for about
1 h.Thethinﬁlmofsilicathatisusuallypresentonsil-
icon nitrideparticlescombines withthe additive(s)and
forms a molten phase. Densiﬁcation and mass trans-portthentakeplace atthehightemperature inatypical
‘liquid-phase’ sintering process. As this intergranular
phase cools, it forms a siliceous glass which can be
encouraged to crystallize (devitrify) by slow cooling
or by separate heat-treatment. This HP route deliber-atelyproducesalimitedamountofsecondphase(upto
3% v/v) as a means of bondingthe refractory particles;
however, this bonding phase has different properties tosiliconnitrideandcanhaveaweakeningeffect,particu-
larlyifservicetemperaturesarehigh.Thus,with3–5%
added magnesia, at temperatures below the softening
point of the residual glassy phase, say 1000
°C, silicon
nitride behaves as a brittle and stiff material; at highertemperatures, there is a fairly abrupt loss in strength,
as expressed by modulus of rupture (MoR) values, and
slowdeformationunderstress(creep)becomesevident.For these reasons, controlled modiﬁcation of the struc-
ture of the inter-granular residual phase is of particular
scientiﬁc concern.
Yttria has been used as an alternative densiﬁer to
magnesia. Its general effect is to raise the softeningpointofintergranularphasesigniﬁcantly.Morespeciﬁ-
cally, it yields crystalline oxynitrides (e.g. Y
2Si3O3N4)
which dissolve impurities (e.g. CaO) and form refrac-tory solid solutions (‘mixed crystals’). Unfortunately,
at high temperatures, yttria-containing silicon nitride
has a tendency to oxidize in a catastrophic and disrup-tive manner.
Although the use of dies places a restriction upon
component shape, hot-pressing increases the bulk den-sity and improves strength and corrosion resistance.
The combination of strength and a low coefﬁcient
of thermal expansion (approximately 3 .2ð10
/NUL6°C/NUL1
over the range 25–1000 °C) in hot-pressed silicon
nitride confer excellent resistance to thermal shock.
Small samples of HPSN are capable of surviving 100thermal cycles in which immersion in molten steel
⊿1600
°C/triangleleftalternates with quenching into water.
In a later phase of development, other researchers
usedhotisostatic-pressing(HIPing)toincrease densityfurther and to produce much more consistent proper-
ties. Silicon nitride powder, again used as the starting
material, togetherwitha relativelysmall amount of theoxideadditive(s)thatpromoteliquid-phasesintering,is
formed into a compact. This compact is encapsulated
in glass (silica or borosilicate). The capsule is evac-uated at a high temperature, sealed and then HIPed,
with gas as the pressurizing medium, at pressures up
to 300 MN m
/NUL2for a period of 1 h. Finally, the glass
envelopeisremovedfromtheisotropicHIPSNcompo-
nent by sand-blasting. Like HPSN, its microstructureconsists of ˇ-Si
3N4(>90%) and a small amount of
intergranular residue (mainly siliceous glass).
Productionroutesinvolvingdeformationatveryhigh
temperatures and pressures, as used for HPSN and
HIPSN, bring about a desirable closure of pores but
inevitablycauseaverysubstantialamountofshrinkage(20–30%). (In contrast to HPSN and HIPSN, RBSN
undergoes negligible shrinkage during sintering at the
lower process temperature of 1400
°C and accordingly
contains much weakening porosity, say 15–30% v/v.)By the early 1970s, considerable progress had been
made in producing silicon nitride by reaction-bonding,
hot-pressing and other routes. However, by then it hadbecome evident that further signiﬁcant improvements
in the quality and capabilities of silicon nitride were
unlikely.Atthisjuncture,attentionshiftedtothesialons.
10.4.2.3 Scientiﬁc basis of sialons
Although silicon nitride possesses extremely usefulproperties, its engineering exploitation has been ham-pered by the difﬁculty of producing it in a fully dense
form to precise dimensional tolerances. Hot-pressing
offers one way to surmount the problem but it is acostlyprocessandnecessarilylimitedtosimpleshapes.
The development of sialons provided an attractive and
feasible solution to these problems.
Sialons are derivatives of silicon nitride and are
accordingly also classiﬁed as nitrogen ceramics. The
acronym ‘sialon’ signiﬁes that the material is based
Ceramics and glasses 327
upon the Si–Al–O–Nsystem. In 1968, on the basis of
structural analyses of silicon nitrides, it was predicted1
that replacement of nitrogen (N3/NUL) by oxygen (O2/NUL)
was a promising possibility if silicon (Si4C)i nt h e
tetrahedral network could be replaced by aluminium
(Al3C), or by some other substituent of valency lower
than silicon. Furthermore, it was also predicted that
systematic replacement of silicon by aluminium would
allow other types of metallic cation to be accommo-
dated in the structure. Such replacement within the
SiN4structural units of silicon nitride would make
it possible to simulate the highly versatile manner in
which SiO 4and AlO 4tetrahedra arrange themselves in
aluminosilicates. A similarly wide range of structures
and properties was anticipated for this new family of
ceramic ‘alloys’. About two years after the vital pre-
diction, British and Japanese groups, acting indepen-
dently, produced ˇ0-silicon nitride, the solid solution
which was to be the prototype of the sialon family.
Inˇ-silicon nitride, the precursor, SiN 4tetrahedra
form a network structure. Each tetrahedron has a cen-
tral Si4Cwhich is surrounded by four equidistant N3/NUL
(Figure 10.2). Each of these corner N3/NULis common to

silicon nitride is possible, the degree of replacementsought in practice is often quite small. With replace-
ment, theformula for thetetrahedral unitchanges from
SiN
4to (Si, Al) (O, N) 4and the dimensions of the unit
cell increase.
Although replacement causes the chemical compo-
sition to shift towards that of alumina, the structural
coordination in the solid solution is fourfold (AlO 4)
whereas in alumina it is sixfold (AlO 6). The strength
of the Al–O bond in a sialon is therefore about 50%
strongerthanitscounterpartinalumina;thisconcentra-
tion of bonding forces between aluminium and oxygen
ionsmakesa sialonintrinsicallystrongerthanalumina.
The problem of representing complex phase rela-
tionships in a convenient form was solved by adopt-
ing the ‘double reciprocal’ diagram, a type of phase
diagram originally developed for inorganic salt sys-
tems by German physical chemists many years ago.
Figure 10.3 shows how a tetrahedron for the four ele-ments Si, Al, O and N provides a symmetrical frame
of reference for four compounds. By using linear
scales calibrated in equivalent % (rather than the usual
weight, or atomic %), each compound appears mid-
way on a tetrahedral edge and the resulting section issquare. An isothermal version of this type of diagram

is shown in Figure 10.4. The ‘double reciprocal’ char-
acteristic refers to the equivalent interplay of N/O and
Si/Al along the vertical and horizontal axes, respec-
tively. It is necessarily assumed that the valency of the
four elements is ﬁxed (i.e. Si4C,A l3C,O2/NULand N3/NUL).
As the formula for the component Si 3N4contains 12
cations and 12 anions, the formulae for the other threecomponents and for the various intermediate phases
along the axes are expressed in the forms which give
a similar charge balance (e.g. Si
3O6rather than SiO 2).
The equivalent % of a given element in these formulaecan be derived from the following equations:
Equivalent % oxygen
D100⊿atomic %O ð2/triangleleft
⊿atomic %O ð2/triangleleftC⊿atomic %N ð3/triangleleft
Equivalent % nitrogen
D100% /NULequivalent % oxygen
Equivalent % aluminium
D100⊿atomic %Al ð3/triangleleft
⊿atomic %Al ð3/triangleleftC⊿atomic %Si ð4/triangleleft
Equivalent % silicon
D100% /NULequivalent %Al
Thus the intermediate phase labelled 3/2 ⊿Si2N2O/triangleleft
contains 25 equivalent % oxygen and is located one
quarter of the distance up the left-hand vertical scale.
An interesting feature of the diagram is the parallel
sequence of phases near the aluminium nitride corner
(i.e. 27R, 21R, 12H, 15R and 8H). They are referredto as aluminium nitride ‘polytypoids’, or ‘polytypes’.They have crystal structures that follow the pattern
of wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) and are generally stable,
refractory and oxidation-resistant.10.4.2.4 Production of sialons
The start point for sialon production from silicon
nitride powder at a temperature of 1800 °C will lie
in the vicinity of the bottom left-hand corner ofFigure 10.4. Simultaneous replacement of N with O
and Si with Al produces the desired ˇ’-phase which
is represented by the narrow diagonal zone project-
ing towards the Al
4O6corner. Such ‘alloying’ of
the ceramic structure produces progressive and subtle
changes in the structure of silicon nitride by altering
thebalancebetweencovalentandionicbondingforces.
The resultant properties can be exceptional. Impor-
tantly, the oxidation resistance and strength of sialons
at temperatures above 1000 °C are greatly superior to
those of conventional silicon nitride. Relatively sim-
ple fabrication procedures, similar to those used for
oxide ceramics, can be adopted. Pressureless-sintering
enables dense complex shapes of moderate size to be
produced.
ˇ-Si3N4powder is the principal constituent of the
starting mixture for ‘alloying’. (As mentioned previ-ously, these particles usually carry a thin layer of
silica.) Although ﬁne aluminium nitride would appear
to be an appropriate source of replacement aluminium,
it readily hydrolyses, making it impracticable to use
fabrication routes which involve aqueous solutions or
binders.Onepatentedmethodforproducinga ˇ
0-sialon
(zD1) solves this problem by reacting the silicon
nitride (and its associated silica) with a specially-
prepared ‘polytypoid’. The phase relations for this
method are shown in Figure 10.4.
An addition of yttrium oxide to the mixture
causes an intergranular liquid phase to form during
pressureless-sintering and encourage densiﬁcation. By
controlling conditions, it is possible to induce this
phase either to form a glass or to crystallize
(devitrify). In sialons, as in many other ceramics,
the ﬁnal character of the intergranular phase hasa great inﬂuence upon high-temperature strength. A
structure of ˇ
0grains Cglass is strong and resists
thermal shock at temperatures approaching 1000 °C.
However, at higher temperatures the glassy phase
deforms in a viscous manner and strength suffers.
Improved stability and strength can be achieved by a
closely-controlled heat-treatment which transforms the
glassy phase into crystals of yttrium-aluminium-garnet
(YAG), as represented in the following equation:
Si5AlON7CY–Si–Al–O–N

The two-phase structure of ˇ0grains CYAG is
extremely stable.Itdoesnotdegrade inthepresence of
molten metals and maintains strength and creep resis-
tance up to a temperature of 1400 °C.
Ceramics and glasses 329
More recent work has led to the production of
sialons from precursors other than ˇ-silicon nitride
(e.g. ˛0-sialons from ˛-silicon nitride and O0-sialons
from oxynitrides). K. H. Jack proposed that ˛-silicon
nitride, unlike the ˇ-form, is not a binary compound
andshouldberegardedasanoxynitride,adefectstruc-
ture showing limited replacement of nitrogen by oxy-
gen. The formula for its structural unit approximates
to SiN 3.9O0.1. Dual-phase or composite structures have
also been developed in which paired combinations of
ˇ0-,˛0-a n dO0- phases provide enhancement of engi-
neering properties. Sometimes, as in ˛0/ˇ0composites,
there is no glassy or crystalline intergranular phase.
The sialon principle can be extended to some unusual
natural waste materials. For instance, two siliceous
materials, volcanic ash and burnt rice husks, have each
been used in sinter mixes to produce sialons. Although
such products are low grade, it has been proposed thatthey could ﬁnd use as melt-resistant refractories.
10.4.2.5 Engineering applications of sialons
The relative ease with which sialons can be shaped is
one of their outstanding characteristics. Viable shap-
ing techniques include pressing (uniaxial, isostatic),extrusion, slip-casting and injection-moulding; their
variety has been a great stimulus to the search for
novel engineering applications. Similarly, their ability
to densify fully during sintering at temperatures in the
order of 1800
°C, without need of pressure application,
favours the production of complex shapes. However,
due allowance must be made for the large amount of
linear shrinkage (20–25%) which occurs as a result
of liquid phase formation during sintering. Althoughﬁnal machining with diamond grit, ultrasonic energy
or laser beam energy is possible, the very high hard-
nessofsialonsencouragesadoptionofanear-net-shape
approach to design. As with many other engineering
ceramics, sialon components are extremely sensitive
to shape and it is generally appreciated that a change
in curvature or section can frequently improve service
performance. Thestructureofasialonis,ofcourse,the
main determinant of its properties. Fortunately, sialonsare very responsive to ‘alloying’ and combinations of
attributes such as strength, stability at high tempera-
tures,resistancetothermalshock,mechanicalwearand
molten metals can be developed in order to withstand
onerous working conditions.
During metal-machining, tool tips are subjected
to highly destructive and complex conditions which
include high local temperatures and thermal shock,
high stresses and impact loading, and degradation bywear. At a test temperature of 1000
°C, the indentation
hardness of ˇ0-sialon ( Cglass) is much greater than
that of either alumina or cobalt-bonded tungsten car-
bide (Figure 10.5). The introduction of tool tips made
from this sialon was a notable success. They were
found to have a longer edge life than conventional
tungsten carbide inserts, could remove metal at high
speed with large depths of cut and could tolerate the
shocks, mechanical and thermal, of interruptedcutting.
Figure 10.5 Hot hardness of sialon, alumina and WC/Co
cutting tool tips (from Jack, 1987, pp. 259–88; reprinted by
permission of the American Ceramic Society) .
The strength and wear resistance of sialons led to
their use in the metal-working operations of extrusion
(hot- and cold-) and tube-drawing. In each process,
the relative movement of the metal stock through the
die aperture should be fast with low friction and mini-
mal die wear, producing closely dimensioned bar/tube
with a smooth and sound surface texture. Sialon die
inserts have been successfully used for both fer-
rous and non-ferrous metals and alloys, challenging
the long-established use of tungsten carbide inserts.
Sialons have also been used for the plugs (captive
or ﬂoating) which control bore size during certain
tube-drawing operations. It appears that the absence
of metallic microconstituents in sialons obviates therisk of momentary adhesion or ‘pick-up’ between dies
and/or plugs and the metal being shaped. Sialon tools
have made it possible to reduce the problems normally
associated with the drawing of difﬁcult alloys such as
stainless steels.
The endurance of sialons at high temperatures and
in the presence of invasive molten metal or slag has
led to their use as furnace and crucible refractories.
On a smaller scale, sialons have been used for com-
ponents in electrical machines for welding (e.g. gas
shrouds, locating pins for the workpiece). These appli-
cations can demand resistance to thermal shock and
wear, electrical insulation, great strength as well as
immunity to attack by molten metal spatter. Sialons
have proved superior to previous materials (alumina,
hardened steel) and have greatly extended the service
life of these small but vital machine components.
330Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
The search for greater efﬁciency in automotive
engines, petrol and diesel, has focused attention on
regions of the engine that are subjected to the mostsevere conditions of heat and wear. Sialons have
been adopted for pre-combustion chambers in indi-
rectdieselengines.Replacementofmetalwithceramicalsoimprovesthepower/weightratio.Itisstillpossiblethat the original goal of researches on silicon nitride

10.4.3 Zirconia
Zirconium oxide (ZrO 2) has a very high melting point
⊿2680°C/triangleleft, chemical durability and is hard and strong;
because of these properties, it has long been used forrefractory containers and as an abrasive medium. At
temperatures above 1200
°C, it becomes electrically
conductiveandisusedforheatingelementsinfurnacesoperating with oxidizing atmospheres. Zirconia-basedmaterials have similar thermal expansion characteris-
tics to metallic alloys and can be usefully integrated
with metallic components in heat engines. In additionto these established applications, it has been found
practicable to harness the structural transitions of zir-
conia, thereby reducing notch-sensitivity and raising
fracture toughness values into the 15–20 MN m
/NUL3/2
band, thus providing a new class of toughened ceram-
ics. This approach is an alternative to increasing the
toughness of a ceramic by either (1) adding ﬁlaments
or (2) introducing microcracks that will blunt the tipof a propagating crack.

The technique of transformation-toughening hinges
upon stabilizing the high-temperature tetragonal (t)
form so that it is metastable at room temperature.
Stabilization, partial or whole, is achieved by addingcertain oxides (Y
2O3, MgO, CaO) to zirconia. In
the metastable condition, the surrounding structure
opposes the expansive transition from t- to m-forms.
In the event of a propagating crack passing into ornear metastable regions, the concentrated stress ﬁeldat the crack tip enables t-crystals of zirconia-rich
solid solution to transform into stable, but less dense,
m-ZrO
2(Figure 10.6). The transformation is marten-
sitic in character. The associated volumetric expan-
sion (3–5% v/v) tends to close the crack and relieve
stresses at its tip. This transformation mechanism isprimarily responsible for the beneﬁcial tougheningeffect of a metastable phase within the microstructure.
The relative stability of zirconia-rich solid solutions
can be conveniently expressed in terms of the phase

diagram for the zirconia-rich end of the ZrO 2–Y2O3
system (Figure 10.7). The same principles apply in
a very general sense to the other two binary sys-tems, ZrO
2–MgO and ZrO 2–CaO. Yttria is partic-
ularly effective as a stabilizer. Three zirconia-basedtypes of ceramic have been superimposed upon thediagram; CSZ, TZP and PSZ. The term CSZ refersto material with a fully-stabilized cubic (not tetrag-onal) crystal structure which cannot take advantageof the toughening transformation. It is used for fur-nace refractories and crucibles. The version knownas tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP) contains theleast amount of oxide additive (e.g. 2–4 mol% Y
2O3)
and is produced in a ﬁne-grained form by sinter-ing and densifying ultra-ﬁne powder in the tem-perature range 1350–1500
°C; such temperatures are
well within the phase ﬁeld for the tetragonal solid
Ceramics and glasses 331
solution (Figure 10.7). After cooling to room temper-
ature, the structure is essentially single-phase, consist-ing of very ﬁne grains ( ¾0.2–1
µm) of t-ZrO 2which
make this material several times stronger than other
types of zirconia-toughened ceramics. A typical TZP
microstructure, as revealed by electron microscopy,is shown in Figure 10.8. Added oxide(s) and sili-
cate impurities form an intergranular phase which can
promote liquid-phase sintering during consolidation.(A similar effect is utilized in the production of siliconnitride.)
In partially-stabilized zirconia (PSZ), small t-crys-
tals are dispersed as a precipitate throughout a matrixof coarser cubic grains. Zirconia is mixed with 8–10mol% additive (MgO, CaO or Y
2O3) and heat-
treated in two stages (Figure 10.7). Sintering in the
temperature range 1650–1850 °C produces a parent
solid solution with a cubic structure which is then
modiﬁed by heating in the range 1100–1450 °C. This
second treatment induces a precipitation of coherentt-crystals ( ¾200 nm in size) within the c-grains. The
morphology of the precipitate depends upon the nature
of the added solute (e.g. ZrO
2–MgO,ZrO 2–CaO and
ZrO2–Y2O3solid solutions produce lenticular, cuboid
and platey crystals, respectively). The average size of
precipitate crystals is determined by the conditions of
temperature and time adopted during heat-treatment inthe crucial ‘t Cc’ ﬁeld of the phase diagram.
In the third example of transformation-toughening,
t-zirconia grains are dispersed in a dissimilar ceramic
matrix; for example, in ZT(A) or ZT ⊿Al
2O3/triangleleftthey
are dispersed among alumina grains (Figure 10.9).
An intergranular distribution of the metastable phase
resultswhenconventionalprocessingmethodsareusedbut it has also been found possible to produce anintragranular distribution. As with PSZ materials, the
size of metastable particles and matrix grains must be
carefully controlled and balanced.

So far, we have concentrated upon mechanical
behaviour at or below ambient temperature. If the tem-
perature of a zirconia-toughened material is raised to
900–1000°C, which is close to the t-m transition tem-
perature, the toughening mechanism tends to become
ineffective. In addition, thermal cycling in servicetendstoinducethet-mtransitionattemperaturesinthe
range 800 –900

ually lost. This tendency for fracture toughness to fallastheservicetemperatureincreaseshasnaturallyledto

systems which have much higher transformation tem-
peratures (e.g. ZT ⊿HfO
2/triangleleft). Intergranular residues (e.g.

become easier to deform as the temperature rises and
the material then suffers loss of strength and resistance
to creep.
10.4.4 Glass-ceramics
10.4.4.1 Controlled devitri ﬁcation of a glass
It has long been appreciated that crystallization can
take place in conventional glassy structures, particu-
larly when they are heated. However, such crystalliza-
tion is initiated at relatively few sites and there is atendency for crystals to grow perpendicular to the free
surface of the glass in a preferred manner. The result-
ing structure, being coarsely crystalline and strongly
oriented, is mechanically weak and ﬁnds no practical
application.
332Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
The basic principle of glass-ceramic production is
that certain compositions of glass respond to con-trolled heat-treatment and can be converted, withoutdistortion and with little dimensional change, froma readily-shaped glass into a ﬁne-grained crystalline
ceramic possessing useful engineering properties. Thekey to this structural transformation, which takes placethroughout the bulk of the glass (volume crystalliza-tion), is the presence of a nucleating agent, or catalyst,in the original formulation.
Controlled devitri ﬁcation of a special glass involves
two or more stages of heat-treatment (Figure 10.10).In theﬁrst stage, which can begin while the glass is
cooling from the forming and shaping operation, hold-ing at a speci ﬁc temperature for a de ﬁnite time period
causes the catalyst to initiate the precipitation of largenumbers of nuclei throughout the glassy matrix. Whentheseseedregionsreachacertainsize,differentspeciesof crystals may begin to grow upon them. Electronmicroscopy has demonstrated that epitaxial relation-ships exist between the ﬁrst-formed crystals and suc-
ceedinggenerationsofcrystals(Figure 10.11). Finally,in the second stage of heat-treatment (Figure 10.10),the structure is heated to a different temperature inorder to induce further crystallization, crystal growth,crystal transitions and a gradual, almost complete, dis-appearance of the glassy matrix.
Control of time and temperature is essential dur-
ing the production by heat-treatment of a glass-ceramic. Figure 10.12 provides a general guide to thetemperature-dependence of nucleation and growthpro-cesses for any melt, irrespective of whether it formsa glassy or crystalline solid. Curve N represents therate of homogeneous nucleation; that is, the numberof nuclei forming per second in each unit volume ofglass. Curve G represents the rate of crystal growth(micron/second). Each curve has a peak value; forviscous glass-forming melts, these maxima are notvery pronounced. With regard to the formation of a

perature which is close to the peak of the nucleationcurve and then, inthe secondstage of heat-treatment, atemperature which does not encourage excessive grain
growth. Usually the temperature chosen for the second
stage is higher than that used for the ﬁrst. A care-
ful balance of conditions during heat-treatment willfavour the production of the desired ultra- ﬁne grain
structure. Thus the rate of nucleation should be high,nuclei should be uniformly dispersed and the rate of
crystal growth should not be excessive. Crystals are
onemicronorlessinsize;interlockingofthesecrystalswill enhance the mechanical strength.
Ceramics and glasses 333
Fundamental studies are complicated by the fact
that the detailed mechanisms by which nuclei formin a homogeneous glassy matrix, and then develop
into crystals, appear to be speci ﬁc to each type
of glass. However, although spinodal decompositionis sometimes possible, it is usually regarded as a
nucleation and growth process. Although the exact
nature of the early stages of nucleation is highlydebatable, the nuclei, once formed, enable hetero-
geneous nucleation of the major crystalline phases
to take place. Metastable phases may form duringheat-treatment; such phases do not feature in phase
(equilibrium) diagrams. Well-knowncrystalline phases
may appear at unexpected temperatures. Nominallymetastable phases may prove to be quite stable under
service conditions. Furthermore, successful composi-
tions are usually multi-component in character andmodifying oxides, particularly the catalyst, can have
a signiﬁcant effect upon the types of crystal produced
and upon their transformation processes. For a givencatalyst, a change in the heat-treatment process can
result in a change in the major crystalline phase(s).
Nucleation in glasses which use an oxide as catalyst
oftenappearstobepreceded byaprocessofseparation
intotwosolidglassyphases(metastableimmiscibility).
These microphases differ in chemical composition andare therefore believed to have a desirable effect upon
the ultimate grain size by favouring a high nucleation
density and reducing the growth rate of crystals. Phaseseparation may occur during either cooling of the melt
or reheating and it is logical to presume that it is
more likely to take place when two network-formersare present in the glass formulation. The production of
Vycor,aSiO
2–B2O3–Na2Oglass,alsotakesadvantage
of phase separation.
10.4.4.2 Development of glass-ceramics
Glass-ceramics date from the late 1950s and are anoffshoot of research by S. D. Stookey at the Corn-
ing Glass Works, USA, on photosensitive glasses. In
the normal procedure for these glasses, after priorirradiation with ultraviolet light, their structure can
be altered by heat-treatment. Metals, such as cop-
per, silver or gold, act as nucleating agents for lim-ited crystallization. It was fortuitously discovered that
higher heat-treatment temperatures could induce com-
plete crystallization. Subsequent research at Corn-ing established that certain oxides could also act as
effective nucleating agents and led to development
of theﬁrst glass-ceramics, which were based on the
SiO
2–Al2O3–LiO2system. Conveniently, these mate-
rials do not require prior irradiation. Oxides which
promote crystallization include titania, zirconia andphosphorus pentoxide.
Practical considerations of production greatly
inﬂuence the development and exploitation of glass-
ceramics. As a general rule, the temperatures of
melting and re ﬁning should not exceed 1400 –1500
°C.
Fortunately, some nucleating agents, such as titania,have a strong ﬂuxing action on silica. In addition, melt
viscosity is important; alumina increases viscosity andwilltendtoslowdownmeltingandre ﬁningoperations.
As composition control is a vital feature of glass-ceramics, it is essential to maintain melt compositionreproducibly from batch to batch. Volatilization andinteraction between the melt and the refractory liningof the melting furnace can make this dif ﬁcult. For
instance, high proportions of lithium oxide in the meltwill increase attack on the lining. The melt leaving themelting furnace has a temperature-dependent viscosity
of 10
13poise and the cooling mass can be worked
and shaped until its viscosity falls to about 108poise.
Although conventional glasses have a useful ‘long’
range of temperature over which they can be worked,the composition of potential glass-ceramics restricts(‘shortens’) this range, particularly when aluminium
oxide is present. As a consequence, the choice ofshaping process may be restricted to gravity orcentrifugal casting.
As metastability is an essential feature of a glass-
ceramic, it is not surprising to ﬁnd that certain
compositions tend to devitrify prematurely during
working. Oxides of aluminium, phosphorus and thealkali metals sodium and potassium inhibit devitri ﬁca-
tioninSiO
2–LiO2glasses.Ontheotherhand,theglass
shouldcrystalliseneithertooquickly(duringcoolingofthemelt) nortooslowly(duringheat-treatment). Thesetendencies can be eliminated by adding oxides whichhaveaspeci ﬁceffectuponthestrengthoftheglassnet-
work structure. For instance, lithium oxide introducesnon-bridgingoxygenions intoa networkof SiO
4tetra-
hedra and, by weakening it, favours crystallization.
10.4.4.3 Typical applications of glass-ceramics
The versatility and potential for development of glass-ceramics quickly led to their adoption in heat engines,chemical plant, electronic circuits, seals, cladding forbuildings, aerospace equipment, nuclear engineering,etc. They can offer a remarkable combination of prop-
erties. For instance, glass-ceramic hob plates for elec-
triccookersarestrong,smoothandeasytoclean,stableover long periods of heating, transparent to infraredradiation from the tungsten halogen lamp, relativelyopaque to visible light (reducing glare) and resistant tothermal shock. The last property originates primarilyfrom the low thermal coef ﬁcient of thermal expan-
sion ( ˛) of this particular glass-ceramic. In the ver-
satile SiO
2–Al2O3–LiO2class of glass-ceramics, the
˛-value can be ‘tailored’from zero to 12 ð10/NUL6°C/NUL1
by controlling structure. Thus, in types containing
about 10% alumina, crystals of lithium disilicateand quartz (or cristobalite) form to give a relativelyhigh expansion coef ﬁcient. Increasing the alumina to
about 20% favours the formation of two types oflithium aluminium silicate crystals, ˇ-spodumene and
ˇ-eucryptite. Over the temperature range 20 –1000
°C,
the˛-values for these two compounds are 0 .9ð
10/NUL6°C/NUL1and/NUL6.4ð10/NUL6°C/NUL1, respectively. Careful
334Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
balancing of their relative amounts against the residual
glass content can reduce the overall expansion coef ﬁ-
cienttowardszero. Thiscapabilityisideal for thelargemirror blanks used for telescopes where dimensionalstability is essential. In heat engines such as lorry gasturbines,alowexpansioncoef ﬁcient isrequiredfor the
regenerativeheatexchangerwhichisalternatelyheatedand cooled by exhaust gases and combustion air. Inglass/glass and metal/glass seals, precise matching ofexpansion characteristics is possible. In the mass pro-duction of colour television tubes, devitri ﬁable solder
glass-ceramics based upon the PbO –ZnO–B
2O3sys-
tem have a fairly high ˛value and have been used to
seal the glass cone to the glassface plate at a relativelylow temperature without risk of distortion. The seal issubsequently heated to form the glass-ceramic.
Aﬁne-grained structure of interlocking crystals
favours mechanical strength; modulus of rupture val-ues are comparable to those for dense alumina. In amachinable varietyofglass-ceramic, interlockingcrys-tals of platey mica de ﬂect or blunt forming cracks
and make it possible for complex machinable com-
ponents to be designed. Chemical stability, as wellas wear-resistance, is essential when service involvescontact with ﬂuids (e.g. valves, pumps, vessel linings).
It is well-known that the ﬂuxing oxides of sodium
and potassium lower the chemical resistance of sil-ica glass to aqueous solutions; in glass-ceramics, thissusceptibility is countered by stabilizing any residualglass phase with boric oxide. Attempts are being madeto extend their use to much higher temperatures (e.g.
1300–1700
°C) by exploiting refractory systems, such
as SiO 2–Al2O3–BaO, which can provide a liquidus
temperature above 1750 °C but such glasses are very
difﬁcult to melt.
Conversionfromglasstocrystalscausesmobileions
to disappear from the structure and become ‘bound’
to crystals, consequently the electrical resistivity anddielectric breakdown strength of glass-ceramics arehigh, even at temperatures up to 500 –700
°C. The
dielectric loss is low.
Utilization of plentiful and cheap waste byproducts
fromindustryforthebulkproductionofglass-ceramics
has stimulated much interest. Although the chemicalcomplexity of materials such as metallurgical slagsmakes it dif ﬁcult to control and complete crystalliza-
tion,strongandwear-resistantproductsforarchitectureand road surfacing have been produced (e.g. Slagce-
ram, Slagsitall ).

The two principal structural forms of this synthetic
compound are ˛-SiC (non-cubic; hexagonal, rhombo-
hedral) and ˇ-SiC (cubic). The cubic ˇ-form begins
to transform to ˛-SiC when the temperature is raised
above 2100 °C. Conditions of manufacture determine
the exact crystal structure and a number of variantshave been identi ﬁed by X-ray diffraction analysis.
For example, many different stacking sequences arepossibleinhexagonal ˛-SiC(e.g.4H,6H).Thenomen-
clatureforsuchvariants(polytypes)indicatesthenum-ber of atomic layers in the stacking sequence and the
crystal system (e.g. 15R, 3C). Tetrahedral grouping of
carbon atoms around a central silicon atom is a com-mon and basic feature of these various structures. Thiscovalent bonding of two tetravalent elements givesexceptional strength and hardness and a very highmelting point ( >2700
°C).
Despite its carbon content, silicon carbide offers
useful resistance to oxidation. At elevated tempera-tures, a thin impervious layer of silica (cristobalite)forms on the grains of carbide. On cooling, the ˛/ˇ
transitionoccurs in cristobalite and it can crack, allow-
ingingressofoxygen.Aboveatemperatureof1500
°C,
the silica layer is no longer protective and the carbidedegrades, forming SiO and CO.
For service applications where resistance to ther-
mal shock is important, it is customary to compare
candidate ceramic materials in terms of a parame-
ter which allows for the effect of relevant properties.Many versions of this parameter have been proposed.A typical parameter ( R) for sudden thermal shock is
RD/ESC⊿1/NUL/ETB/triangleleft/E˛,w h e r e /ESCis the modulus of rupture
(N m
/NUL2),/ETBis the Poisson ratio (0.24 for REFELSiC),
Eis the modulus of elasticity (N m/NUL2), and ˛is the
linear coef ﬁcient of thermal expansion ⊿K/NUL1/triangleleft.I nt h e
case of silicon carbide, the product in the denomi-
nator tends to be high, giving a low index. Siliconnitride gives a higher index and it is understandablethat Si
3N4-bonded silicon carbide is preferred when
serviceinvolvesthermalcycling.Theseverityofshock
can affect the rating of different materials. Thus, for
less rapid shock, a thermal conductivity term ( k)i s
included as a multiplier in the numerator of the aboveparameter.
10.4.5.2 Production of silicon carbide powder
and products
Silicon carbide is a relatively costly material because
its production is energy-intensive. The Acheson carbo-thermic process, which is the principal source of com-mercial-quality silicon carbide, requires 6 –12 kWh
per kg of silicon carbide. Locations served by hydro-
electric power, such as Norway and the Niagara Fallsin Canada, are therefore favoured for synthesis plant.In this unique process, a charge of pure silica sand(quartz), petroleum coke (or anthracite coal), sodiumchloride and sawdust is packed around a 15 m long
graphite conductor. A heavy electric current is passed
through the conductor and develops a temperature inexcess of 2600
°C. The salt converts impurities into
volatile chlorides and the sawdust provides connectedporosity within the charge, allowing gases/vapours to
escape. The essential reaction is:
SiO
2C3C/NUL! ˛-SiCC2CO
Ceramics and glasses 335
The reaction product from around the electrode is
ground and graded according to size and purity. The
colourcan rangefrom green (99.8%SiC) togrey (90%SiC).
Numerous chemical conversion and gas-phase syn-
thesis processes have been investigated. The temper-
atures involved are generally much lower than those
developed in the Acheson process; consequently, theyyield the cubic ˇ-form of silicon carbide. Chemical
vapour deposition (CVD) has been used to produceﬁlaments and ultra- ﬁne powders of ˇ-SiC.
Silicon carbide shapes for general refractory appli-
cations are produced by ﬁring a mixture of SiC grains
and clay at a temperature of 1500
°C. The resultant
bond forms mullite and a glassy phase, absorbing thethin layer of silica which encases the grains. Other
bonding media include ethyl silicate, silica and sili-
con nitride. The latter is developed in situbyﬁring a
SiC/Si compact in a nitrogen atmosphere. This parti-cular bond is strong at high temperatures and helps to
improve thermal shock resistance.
Specialized and often costly processing methods are
used to produce ﬁne dense ceramics for demanding
engineering applications. The methods available forforming silicon carbide powders include dry-pressing,
HIPing,slip-casting,extrusionandinjection-moulding.
The last process requires an expendable polymericbinderandisparticularlyattractiveincaseswherelongproduction runs of complex shapes are envisaged (e.g.automotive applications). With regard to ﬁring, the
main methods are akin to those developed for silicon
nitride; each, in its own way, is intended to maximizethe quality of interparticle bonding. They include hot-pressing (HP SiC), pressureless-sintering (S SiC) andreaction-sintering (Si SiC).
The hot-pressing method for producing ˛-SiC
blanks of high density was originally developed by theNorton Co., USA. A small amount of additive (boroncarbide ⊿B
4C/triangleleftor a mixture of alumina and aluminium)
plays a key role while the carbide grains are being
heated ⊿>2000°C/triangleleftandcompressedininduction-heated
graphite dies. It has been suggested in the caseof HP SiC (and S SiC) that the boron encouragesgrain boundary/surface diffusion and that the carbonbreaks down the silica layers which contaminate grain
surfaces.Theseadditivesleaveanintergranularresidue
which determines the high-temperature service ceiling.The hot-pressed blanks usually require mechanicalﬁnishing (e.g. diamond machining). Production of
complexshapesbyhot-pressingisthereforeexpensive.
The pressureless-sintering route (for S SiC) uses
extremely ﬁne silicon carbide powders of low oxygen
content. Again, an additive is necessary (B
4Co ra l u -
minium Ccarbon) in order to promote densi ﬁcation.
The mixture is cold-pressed and then ﬁred at approxi-
mately 2000 °C in an inert atmosphere.
TheREFELprocess for producing siliconized sili-
con carbide (Si SiC) was developed by the UKAEAand is an example of reaction-sintering (reaction-
bonding). A mixture of ˛-SiC, graphite and a plas-
ticizing binder is compacted and shaped by extrusion,pressing, etc. This ‘green’compact can be machined,
after which the binder is removed by heating in an
oven. The pre-form is then immersed in molten silicon
under vacuum at a temperature of 1700
°C. Graphitic
carbon and silicon react to form a strong intergran-ular bond of ˇ-SiC. A substantial amount of ‘excess’
silicon(say,8 –12%)remainsinthestructure;themax-
imum operating temperature is thus set by the meltingpoint of silicon (i.e. 1400
°C. Beyond this temperature
there is a rapid fall in strength. Ideally, neither unre-
acted graphite nor un ﬁlled voids should be present in
theﬁnal structure. The dimensionalchanges associated
with the HP process are small and close tolerances canbe achieved; the shrinkage of 1 –2% is largely due to
the bake-out of the binder.
10.4.5.3 Applications of silicon carbide
Silicon carbide has been the subject of continuousdevelopment since it was ﬁrst produced by the then-
remarkable Acheson process in 1891.
1Now it is avail-
able in a wide variety of forms which range frommonolithics to single-crystal ﬁlaments (whiskers). It
is used for metal-machining, refractories and heating
elements in furnaces, chemical plant, heat exchangers,
heat engines, etc.
The extreme hardness (2500 –2800 kgf mm
/NUL2;
Knoop indenter) of its particles and their ability
to retain their cutting edges at high contacttemperatures(circa1000
°C)quicklyestablishedsilicon
carbide grits as important grinding media. The
comparatively high cost of silicon carbide refractories
is generally justi ﬁed by their outstanding high-
temperature strength, chemical inertness, abrasionresistance and high thermal conductivity. In the NewJersey process for producing high-purity zinc, SiC is
used for components such as distillation retorts, trays
and the rotating condensation impellers which have towithstand the action of molten zinc and zinc vapour.In iron-making, silicon carbide has been used to line
thewater-cooledboshandstackzonesofiron-smelting
blast furnaces, where its high thermal conductivity andabrasion-resistance are very relevant. However, it canbe attacked by certain molten slags, particularly those
rich in iron oxides. This characteristic is illustrated
by experience with the skid rails which support steelbillets in reheating furnaces. This type of furnaceoperates at a temperature of 1250
°C. Water-cooled
steel rails have traditionally been used but warp,
wear rapidly and tend to form ‘cold spots ’where
1Carborundum Co. Ltd: The Americans E. G. Acheson and
W. A. McCallister gave the name Carborundum to their
new material, assuming that it was a combination of carbon
and corundum ⊿Al2O3/triangleleft. Even after its true chemical identity
was established, Acheson retained the name, regarding it as
‘phonetic, of pleasing effect in print, even though a tri ﬂe
lengthy’.
336Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
they contact the billets. Replacement with uncooled
silicon carbide rails solved these problems but it was
found that iron oxide scale from the billets couldmelt and attack silicon carbide. Some improvement
was achieved by ﬂush-mounting the rails in the
furnace ﬂoor.
Silicon carbide also has a key role in recent designs
of radiant tube heaters in gas-ﬁred furnaces. The com-
bination of a 60 kW recuperative burner and a radi-
ant tube (1.4 m long ð170 mm diameter) made from

This British Gas design allows outgoing combustion
products to preheat incoming air, giving high thermal
efﬁciency,andalsokeepsthesegasesseparatefromtheatmospherewithinthefurnacechamber.Themaximumsurface temperature for the radiant tube is 1350
°C.
Silicon carbide is electrically conductive and care
has to be taken when it is used as a refractory in thestructure of electrometallurgical plant. However, thecombination of electrical conductivity and refractori-
ness offers special advantages. For example, silicon
carbide resistor elements have been used since about1930 in indirect resistance-heated furnaces throughout
industry (e.g. Globars). These elements act as energy-
conversiondevices,heatingthefurnacechargebyradi-ation and convection. They can operate in air and inertgas atmospheres at temperatures up to 1650
°C but
certain conditions can shorten their life (e.g. carbon
pick-up from hydrocarbon gases, oxidation by watervapour). Service lifealsotendstodecrease astheoper-ating temperature is increased. Provided that service
conditions are not too severe, a life of at least 10000 h
can be anticipated. A double-helical heating sectionis available as an alternative to the standard cylindri-cal shape and allows both electrical connections to bemade at the same end. Elements should be of reason-
able diameter/length and be neither too fragile nor toomassive.
The presence of impurity atoms in silicon carbide
enables electron ﬂow to take place; it is accordinglyclassed as an extrinsic semiconductor. The electricalresistance of silicon carbide is very temperature-dependent, decreasing from room temperature to650
°C and then slowly increasing with further rise
in temperature. Because of this characteristic andthe great sensitivity of cold-resistance to traces ofimpurities, a typical production procedure is to checktheresistanceofeachelement(inair)withanelectrical
load per cm
2of radiating surface which is equivalent
to a typical operating surface temperature (e.g.
15.5 W cm/NUL2and 1070 °C). This nominal resistance
is then used to calculate the number and size ofelements required. As the element ages, its resistanceslowly increases. A constant rate of energy input to thefurnaceismaintainedbyincreasingthevoltageappliedacross the elements (e.g. by multi-tap transformer).
Specialized forms of silicon carbide now ﬁnd
widespread use in engineering. At ambient temper-atures, they serve in machine components subjectedto abrasive wear (e.g. mechanical seals, bearings,slurry pump impellers, wire dies, ﬁbre spinnerets).In high-temperature engineering, silicon carbide isnow regarded, together with silicon nitride and thesialons, as a leading candidate material for servicein heat engine designs which involve operation attemperatures in excess of 1000
°C (e.g. glow plugs,
turbocharger rotors, turbine blades and vanes, rocketnozzles). Glow plugs minimize the hazards of ‘ﬂame-out’ in the gas turbine engines of aircraft. Their func-tion is to reignite the fuel/air mixture. They must
withstand considerable thermal shock; for instance,

Materials) .

on engine start-up the temperature rises from ambi-
ent to 1600 °C in 20 s and falls to 900 °Ci nl e s st h a n
1 s if ﬂame-out occurs. Si 3N4-bonded silicon carbide
performed well in this application. Large-scale uti-
lization in gas-turbine and diesel engines has been
greatly inhibited by the inherent brittleness of silicon
carbide. Addition of a second phase to the structure,
the composite approach, is regarded as a likely way
to solve this problem of low fracture toughness. In a
moregeneralsense,itisacceptedthatthemethodology
and practice of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and
proof-testing for ceramic components require furtherreﬁnement.
10.4.6 Carbon
10.4.6.1 The versatility of carbon
LyinginthecentralzoneofthePeriodicTablebetween
metallic and non-metallic elements, carbon has been
aptly described as the chameleon among materials.
Over the years it has become available in numerous
forms yet still retains its capacity to surprise. The
recent discovery and production of an exciting and
completely new structural form, buckminsterfullerene,
illustratesthispoint.Carboniscustomarilyclassedasa
ceramic because of its long-establisheduse as a refrac-tory: present-day use of clay/graphite crucibles as con-
tainers for molten metals echoes its use for the same
purpose in the sixteenth century. Its high-temperature
capabilities are exceptional. Although carbon is the
traditional fuel for combustion and, ideally, should
only be used as a heat-resistant engineering material in
atmospheres of low oxygen content, the rate at which
it is wasted by oxidation is very often acceptable to
industry and compares favourably with that of many
metals.
Materials science tends to emphasize the two con-
trasting crystalline forms (allotropes) of carbon, dia-
mond and graphite, particularly as they represent
extremes of hardness and softness. Both forms occur
naturally and can be synthesized. Industry has long
recognizedtheiruniquepropertiesandhassuccessfully
developed an extremely wide and potentially confus-
ing range of specialized carbon products. Within this
range of structurally-different products, the degree of
crystallinity may range from highly-developed to min-
imal. The following categories of carbon product will
now be examined in order to illustrate the general
signiﬁcance of structure and the ways in which it
can be manipulated: natural and synthetic diamonds,
baked and graphitized carbons, pyrolytic graphite, vit-
reous carbon, intercalation compounds, buckminster-
fullerene.
10.4.6.2 Natural diamond
The cubic form of carbon is renowned for its
hardness, strength and beauty. The carbon–carbon
bond lengths are all the same (0.1555 nm) so that anysections taken through the tetrahedrally coordinated,
highly symmetrical structure cut a large number ofthese strong bonds; accordingly, there are no planes
of easy cleavage. In commercial terms, there are
three main qualities of mined diamonds: gemstones,
industrial stones and boart (bort, bortz). Roughstones of gemstone quality are an exclusively naturalproduct and their appearance is enhanced by ahighly-demanding cutting procedure which involvescleavage on meticulously-selected planes, such as thef111g, and sawing/grinding/polishing with a mixture
of diamond paste and olive oil. During cutting at
least half of the mass is lost.
1The symmetrical
faceted shapes produced by the lapidary comply withstandard mathematically-substantiated patterns (cuts)which optimise the optical effects of internal reﬂection(‘life’) and refraction (‘ﬁre’). Three cuts currentlyfavoured are brilliant, emerald or baguette.
Singleindustrialstonesof near-gem qualityare used
as tools for trueing and dressing grinding wheels,engraving, rock-drilling and as dies for drawing wiresof copper, steel, tungsten, etc. In the important pro-cess of trueing and dressing, a tool holding a singlediamond is held against the working face of the grind-ing wheel as it rotates. The wheel proﬁle is correctedand grit particles are left projecting slightly above thebonding matrix. Natural single crystals are used fordrawing the smaller sizes of wire (e.g. <0.2 mm).
These dies have a crystallographically-oriented aper-ture which is typically capable of passing 10000 kmof wire before dimensional tolerances are exceeded.
Diamond indenters are used in macrohardness and
microhardness testing machines (Section 5.2.2.4). Sur-
face textures of machined metals are commonly char-
acterized by proﬁlometers which traverse a samplinglength with a ﬁne diamond stylus; interpretation of theresultant high-resolution trace should be tempered bythe observation that the moving stylus tends to plougha furrow in the test surface.
Boart is generally <1.5 mm in size, badly ﬂawed
andimperfectlycrystallized.Formanyyears,boartwasvirtually unsaleable. Then, in the 1930s, its use as anabrasive grit or powder for impregnating the workingfaces of grinding wheels was fostered. Thereafter itfound increasing application on a large scale for saw-ing, drilling and machining operations and became anaccepted abrasive medium for non-ferrous metals andalloys, hard carbides, concrete, rock, glass, polymers,etc. The working face of a bonded grinding wheel thatis being propelled into the workpiece is a compos-ite structure, consisting of abrasive particles of grit(diamond, cobalt-bonded tungsten carbide, alumina orsilicon carbide) set in a bonding matrix. The matrixcanbesinteredmetal,electroplate,vitreousorresinoid.Selection of the best combination of grit and bond can
draw from a large pool of practical experience and
broadly depends upon the material being machinedand upon the machining conditions. It is reasonable

0.2 g: for alloyed gold, the carat is one twenty-fourth part
by mass of gold.
338Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
to regard each particle of diamond grit as a single cut-
ting tool. The tendency of some qualities of diamond
to fracture and regenerate new cutting edges, rather
than be torn out of the matrix, can be advantageous in
certain machining operations. The high thermal con-
ductivity of diamond (which is greater than that of
copper) and low coefﬁcient of friction minimize thegeneration and dissipation of heat from each of a myr-
iad of such tools. Characteristics such as these have
encouraged the trend toward higher rates of feed and
greater peripheral wheel speeds, to the beneﬁt of pro-
ductivity, dimensional accuracy and surface texture.In simple terms, a higher cutting speed means that
each particle is subjected to stress and heat effects for
shorter periods of time. (The availability of synthetic
grits has aided this particular development in grinding
practice.)
Lapping and polishing operations require diamond
powders;undertheseﬁne-scalecuttingoperations,heatgeneration is not usually a problem. In the metallo-
graphic polishing of metallic and ceramic specimens,
a progression from coarse to sub-micron powders
smoothes the surface as well as gradually reducing the
depth of unwanted surface distortion.
10.4.6.3 Synthetic diamond
The quest for a method to synthesize diamonds fromcarbonaceous material dates back to the nineteenth
century. After World War II, research was stimulated
by political uncertainties in Africa that threatened to
jeopardizesuppliesofboart.Theﬁrstannouncementof
thesuccessfulsynthesisofdiamondsfromgraphitewasmade bytheGeneralElectricCompany, USA,in1955.
(Later, it transpired that the ASEA, Stockholm, Swe-
den had achieved a comparable result two years earlier
but had not publicized it.) These remarkable methods
simultaneously subjected graphite to extremely high
static pressures and high temperatures.
1
The physical conditions necessary for synthesis are
customarily discussed in terms of the type of phase
diagram shown in Figure 10.14. The key feature is
the ascending Berman-Simon line2representing equi-
librium between diamond and graphite. Diamond is
stable above this line and graphite is stable below it.
Diamond is able, of course, to exist below the linein a metastable condition at ordinary pressures; how-
ever, it was found experimentally that heating above
a temperature of 1800 K caused rearrangement of its
extremely strong C–C bonds and transformation into
graphite. From the diagram it may be deduced that
the reverse transition, from graphite to diamond, will
take place above the line at similar temperatures if a

winner P. W. Bridgman (1882–1961) at HarvardUniversity, USA, on methods for developing ultra-highpressures.

two Oxford physicists, R. Berman and F. Simon.

carbon (after Bovenkerk et al., 1959, pp. 1094–8) .
pressure of at least 60 kb is applied simultaneously.
The GEC method achieved these conditions. It alsorelies upon an addition of a metal (e.g. Ni, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co) which acts as a molten solvent for carbon
and a catalyst for diamond crystallization and growth.
The liquidus line for the eutectic mixture of carbon
and nickel is superimposed on the diagram in orderto deﬁne the diamond-growing region (shaded). Early
synthetic crystals were usually grown under conditions
of temperature and pressure well above the Berman-Simon line and were consequently weak and friable,
containing stacking faults and metallic inclusions. As
improved methods for measuring process temperatureandpressurebecame available,experienceshowedthat
synthesis in the shaded region just above the Berman-
Simon line gave slower and more controllable growth.
Later GEC experiments at pressures up to 200 kb
transformed well-crystallized graphite into small
diamond crystallites, about 0.1 mm in size, with a
wurtzite-type structure showing hexagonal symmetry.
Subsequently, natural ‘hexagonal’ diamonds
3(in
association with cubic diamonds) were identiﬁed in
meteorites; presumably they formed on impact withthe earth. Small ‘hexagonal’ diamonds have also been
synthesized by explosive shock-loading techniques
that are capable of developing pressures as high as500–1000 kb. These conditions only apply over a
period of a few microseconds and thus tend to restrict
a physical transition which is time-dependent.
Synthesis is now practised worldwide and is capa-
ble of producing diamonds which meet precise physi-
cal and chemical requirements. Mined diamonds areinevitably more variable in quality. The maximum
size of synthetic diamonds is in the order of 1 mm.
Demand for industrial diamonds far exceeds that for

Ceramics and glasses 339
gemstones; approximately 85–90% of industrial dia-
monds are synthesized and are mainly consumed in
abrasion processes. Synthetic and natural diamond
abrasives compete with silicon carbide and alumina.
As mentioned elsewhere, diamond machining is a ﬁnaloperation in the production of many of the new engi-
neering ceramics.
10.4.6.4 Scientiﬁc classiﬁcation of diamonds
The structural imperfections to be found in diamonds
include crystalline inclusions, cracks, impurity atoms
and vacant sites. Broadly, inclusions and cracks act as
stress-concentrators and mainly affect the mechanicalproperties, whereas ﬁne-scale defects, notably impu-
rity atoms of nitrogen and boron, inﬂuence physi-
cal properties such as optical absorption, electrical
conductivity, etc. Inclusions in natural diamonds are
particles of mineral matter. Inclusions in synthetic dia-mondsderivefromthemetalsusedascatalysts(i.e.Ni,
Co, Fe).
The generally-accepted classiﬁcation of diamonds,
which is shown in Table 10.2, recognizes four main
categories. It is based upon absorption characteristics
determined over the ultraviolet, visible and infraredregions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The choice
of this approach is perhaps not surprising when one
considersthevisibleresponseofcutdiamondstowhite
light. Absorption spectra are highly structure-sensitive
and have made it possible to classify different qualitiesof natural and synthetic diamond in terms of their
content of ﬁne defects, such as impurity atoms and
vacant sites. Each type of defect provides so-called‘optical centres’ which decide the speciﬁc manner in
which components of incident radiation are absorbed
and/or transmitted by the crystal structure. A diamondfrequentlycontainsmorethanonetypeofdefect,hence
interpretation of absorption spectra can sometimes be
difﬁcult and rather arbitrary.
The decrease in intensity for a particular wave-
length, as a result of absorption, is expressed bythe classic exponential relation IDI
0e/NUL˛/US,w h e r e I
is the intensity of transmitted radiation, I0is the
intensity of incident monochromatic radiation and
˛is the coefﬁcient of absorption. /USis the path
length. Long path lengths within the diamond increasethe amount of optical interaction, producing a sizeeffect which explains why larger diamonds tend to be
more colourful.
It will be seen that the classiﬁcation ﬁrst dis-
tinguishes between Type I diamonds which contain
nitrogen (say, up to 0.1–0.2%) and Type II diamonds
which have an extremely low nitrogen content. Type
I diamonds are further sub-divided according to thespatial distribution of nitrogen atoms. In natural dia-
monds, geologic periods of time at high temperatures
and pressure have permitted nitrogen atoms to cluster,
sometimes, apparently, intoplatelets.In most synthetic
diamonds, the nitrogen atoms are more dispersed.
Nitrogen, singly or in groups, can occupy substitu-
tionalorinterstitialsitesandareresponsibleforatleastﬁve types of optical centre (e.g. A, B, N, N3, platelet).
(Thus, the designation Type IaB signiﬁes that the dia-
mond containsB centres wherein a few nitrogen atoms
have clustered and replaced carbon atoms.)
From the distinction between Type IIa and Type IIb
diamonds, it will be seen that the ability of diamond
to act as either an insulator or a semiconductor is
governed by its impurity content. In Type II diamonds,
the concentration of impurity atoms is smaller than in
Type I diamonds, usually being expressed in parts per
million. In terms of the electron theory of conduction,
purediamondhasaﬁlledvalencebandthatisseparatedfrom a partly ﬁlled conduction band by a substantial
energy gap of 5.5 eV. The mean available thermal
energy is approximately 0.025 eV and is therefore
insufﬁcientto transportelectronsthroughthe gap. Pure
diamondisconsequentlyanelectricalinsulatoratroomtemperature. In a similar sense, photons of white light
have associated wavelengths ranging from 400 nm
(D3.1 eV) to 730 nm ( D1.7 eV) and pass through
thecrystalwithoutbringingaboutelectronictransitions
which bridge the gap. Absorption of energy from these
incidentphotonsissmall.However,photonsassociated
with shorter wavelengths in the ultraviolet range canexceed the energy requirement of 5.5 eV and the gap
is bridged.
Moving on from the special case of pure dia-
mond to Type I diamonds, the introduction of nitrogen
atoms ( ZD7) intothe carbonstructure( ZD6)allows
tetrahedral bonding to be maintained but also adds
extra electrons. Optical absorptionnow becomes likely
because electrons can move to higher levels within the
band gap. However, the presence of nitrogen atoms

doesnotconferconductivity.InTypeIIbdiamonds,the
principal impurity is boron ( ZD5). Measured atomic
concentrations of boron are often less than 0 .5ð10/NUL6.
Each boron atom can contribute only three electrons to
the surrounding four carbon atoms and therefore pro-
vides an acceptor site within the band gap, allowing‘holes’ to form in the valence band. Semiconductiv-ity then becomes possible. The two impurity elements
nitrogen and boron thus have contrasting effects upon
the diamond structure, providing donor and acceptorsites, respectively. When both elements are present,some degree of compensation occurs. For instance, asurfeit of nitrogen can neutralize the effect of boron
atoms and the semiconducting characteristic is absent.
If a diamond is colourless and electrically conductiveone might reasonably infer that it contains traces ofnitrogen and uncompensated boron and is classiﬁable
as Type IIb.
Speciﬁc types of diamond have proved successful
in highly specialized applications. For instance, TypeIa and Type IIa diamonds have very high thermal con-
ductivities (1000 and 2000 W m
/NUL1,K/NUL1, respectively,
at room temperature) and have been used as heat sinksin electronic devices that release much thermal energywithinaconﬁnedspace.Detector‘windows’ofTypeII
diamond are virtually transparent to infrared radiation
and have been used in conditions as disparate as thoseofdiamondsynthesisanvilsandspaceprobes.TypeIIbdiamonds have interesting semiconductive prospects,
possibly being capable of operating at higher temper-
atures than silicon devices, but developments in thisarea have been restricted by the difﬁculty of develop-ingn-type devices to complement the p-type devices
described above.
10.4.6.5 Polycrystalline diamond (PCD)
Polycrystalline aggregates of diamonds rarely occur in
nature. It is now possible to synthesise a ﬁne-grainedaggregate by sintering diamond crystallites (2–25 mmin size) at a high temperature and pressure in the pres-
ence of a metal such as cobalt. The resultant blanks
of PCD are typically about 50 mm diameter and canbe electric discharge machined (EDM) to the requiredshape and size, thus overcoming the problems associ-
ated with producing large single crystals. During sin-
tering, the randomly-oriented grains deform plasticallyand interlock. Molten cobalt acts as a solvent/catalystand also ﬁlls the interstices between the grains. This
structure has a better wear resistance than either natu-
ral diamond or tungsten carbide. It is also appreciablytougher than single crystals of diamond because therandom orientation of grains forces any propagating
crack to take an erratic, transgranular path which con-
sumes strain energy.
PCD is used to make metal-working dies for draw-
ing the larger sizes of metallic wire (e.g. >0.2 mm).
(With smaller sizes of wire, a natural single crystal of
diamond gives a better surface texture.) When usedfor cutting tools, a thin layer of PCD is supported by athicker layer of tungsten carbide. The latter is brazed
onto the tool body. The standard quality of PCD issubject to a temperature ceiling of 700
°Ct h a ti ss e t
by two factors. First, cobalt expands more than the
diamond phase and higher temperatures cause stresscracks to form. Second, above 700
°C, cobalt promotes
the conversion of diamond into graphite. These prob-
lems were solved by either removing the cobalt phaseby acid leaching or by using silicon instead of cobalt.
This variety of PCD is thermally stable at tempera-
tures up to 1200
°C and has been successfully used for
drilling bits in hard-rock mining.
10.4.6.6 Baked carbons and graphitized carbons
Cruciblesmadefromnaturalgraphitebondedwithﬁre-clay have been used in metal-melting operations for
centuries. Although their strength is not exceptional,
they can withstand temperatures of up to 1200
°C.
Other applications of natural graphite include lubri-
cants,brakelinings,bearings,foundryfacingsandpen-
cil ‘leads’. Crystallinity is well developed and they arerelatively unreactive.
Most of the great demand for manufactured car-
bons is met by synthesis. Applications are extremelydiverse: brushes for electric motors and generators,
rocket nozzles and nose cones for space vehicles,
refractory linings for furnaces, moulds for metal-founding and hot-pressing, moderators and reﬂectors
for nuclear reactors, electrodes for arcwelding, etc.
There are two main types of bulk carbon products for
industrial applications. Neither melting nor sintering
are involved in their manufacture.
Baked carbons, the ﬁrst category, are produced by
extruding/moulding a mix of carbonaceous ﬁller or
grist (e.g. petroleum coke, anthracite, pitch coke, etc.)and binder (e.g. coal-tar pitch, thermosetting resin).
The shaping method determines the general anisotropy
of the ﬁnal product because the coke particles usu-ally have one axis longer than the other, consequently
extrusion orients the particles parallel to the extrusion
direction whereas moulding orients particles perpen-dicular to the compression forces. (Accordingly, the
ﬁnal product usually has a so-called ‘grain’.) The
‘green’ shape is heated (baked) in a reducing atmo-sphere at a temperature of 1000–1200
°C. During this
criticaloperation,thepitchdecomposesor‘cracks’and
providescarbonlinkagesbetweentheparticlesofﬁller.Copious amounts of volatiles are evolved, producing
about 20–30% porosity. Porosity weakens the struc-
ture, inﬂuences electrical conductivity and, because ofits connected nature, makes the structure permeable to
gases and liquids. It may be reduced by impregnating
the baked carbon with more pitch and baking again.Further heat treatment at substantially higher temper-
atures of 2500–3000
°C causes the structure to graphi-
tize. An electric resistance furnace is necessary forthis purpose, hence the products are sometimes called
electrographites. (Most designs of electric furnaces for
larger sizes of product are modiﬁcations of the original
Ceramics and glasses 341
Acheson design of 1895, a furnace which has a special
place in the history of the carbon industry.)
Final shapes, whether baked or graphitized, can be
readily and accurately machined. The ﬁnal proper-
ties of the carbon product depend upon the interplayof variables such as initial grain size, type of ﬁller
or binder, purity, furnace temperature, etc. Thus, the
higher processing temperatures that are used for elec-trographites eliminate strain, heal imperfections and
promotegraphitizationwithinthestructure.Asaresult,
electrographites have much higher electrical and ther-mal conductivities than baked carbons, making it pos-
sible to halve the cross-sectional area of an electrode
and gain valuable savings in mass and size. Accord-ingly, electrographites are favoured for large steel-
melting furnaces. However, both baked carbons and
the more costly electrographites ﬁnd general appli-cation in a wide variety of electric furnaces. Their
availability and continuous development have made
a vital contribution to the electric are processes usedto mass-produce steel, aluminium, carbides of silicon
and calcium, alkali metals and their hydroxides, phos-
phorus, magnesium, chlorine, etc. In addition to beingrefractory, electrodes must withstand chemical attack,
mechanical damage during charging of the furnace,
severe gradients in temperature and thermal shock.In the last respect, carbon electrodes possess a valu-
able combination of properties; that is, low thermal
expansivity, low modulus of elasticity, good high-temperature strength and high thermal conductivity.
The low electrical resistivity minimizes resistive heat-
ing and thus helps to restrict the temperature of theelectrode.

10.4.6.7 Pyrolytic graphite and vitreous carbon
Most of the graphitic carbons produced for industry
are polycrystalline and, as indicated previously, often
exhibit bulk anisotropy, usually as a result of the shap-
ing process. Anisotropy is the outstanding character-istic of individual graphite crystals; in fact, graphite
can exhibit more anisotropy in certain properties than
most other types of crystal. In polycrystalline prod-ucts, it has often been necessary to cancel out dan-
gerous anisotropic effects by deliberately randomizing
the orientation of the grains (e.g. moderator graphitefor nuclear reactors). A converse approach has led to
the successful production of graphite with enhanced
anisotropy (i.e. pyrolytic graphite (PG)). Compared toconventionalgraphite,PGislesschemicallyactiveand
mechanicallystronger.Itcanalsobemachinedtoclose
dimensional tolerances. In the 1960s, for the ﬁrst time,it became possible to produce pieces of near-perfectgraphite that could be used to explore the physics and
chemistry of anisotropy in greater detail.
1
Inthebasicmethodofproduction,pyrolyticgraphite
is deposited by bringing a mixture of hydrocarbon gas(methane, CH
4, or propane, C 3H8) and an inert car-
rier gas into contact with a substrate material whichis heated to a temperature of approximately 2000
°C.
Molecules of the hydrocarbon are thermally ‘cracked’within the boundary layer of ﬂow at the substrate
surface. (e.g. CH
4DCgrC2H2. As indicated previ-
ously, the physical character of the deposit is deter-
mined by the process conditions, such as temperature,
partial pressure of hydrocarbon gas, substrate mate-rial and area. These conditions, which are extremelycritical, decide whether the deposit-forming carbonreaches the substrate surface as individual atoms,planar fragments or as three-dimensional clusters.Thus, planar fragments form laminar deposits whichare highly anisotropic whereas larger clusters formisotropic deposits with little or no overall anisotropy.
If the substrate takes the form of a resistance-heated
carbon mandrel, a tubular deposit can be produced.
Pyrolytic graphite, as-deposited, consists of crystal-
lites which exhibit some degree of disorder as well asstratiﬁcation. In order to explain the nature of its struc-ture, it is helpful to compare it with that of graphitein its most stable form. The perfect crystal has a reg-ularABABAB ...stacking of hexagonal f0002glayers
in which the distance of closest approach between
layers is approximately 0.335 nm. This exact registry
of hexagonal planes, with its ABABAB ...mode of
stacking, is not found in pyrolytic graphite. Instead,synthesis by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) pro-duces a ‘turbostratic’ arrangement of layers in whichthe hexagonal networks, although still parallel, donot register precisely with each other (Figure 10.15).This disregistry has been likened to a pack of play-
ing cards in which the long and short edges are each
misaligned. Such structures are both disordered andstratiﬁed, hencetheterm ‘turbostratic’.Each crystallitecomprises a number of hexagonal layers and the inter-layer distance is greater than the ideal of 0.335 nm. Itis useful to assign a c-axis to the stack of layers form-
ing each crystallite and to determine average valuesfor this dimension ⊿L
c/triangleleftby X-ray diffraction analysis.
In general terms, a turbostratic structure in graphite
is envisaged as a conglomerate of crystallites sepa-
rated by fairly stable transition zones of carbon atoms.If annealed at a very high temperature, say 3200
°C,
1Professor A. R. J. P. Ubbelohde, FRS (1907–1988) and
co-workers at Imperial College, London, produced valuable
prototypes and made many important contributions to
graphite science (e.g. stress-recrystallization, intercalation
compounds).

a turbostratic structure will ‘heal’ and approach the
stableABABAB ...conﬁguration.
Various other methods are available for producing
pyrolytic graphite. Composite structures for aerospaceapplications have been produced by depositing
pyrolytic graphite on mats of carbon ﬁbre. In the
ﬁeld of nuclear reactors, ﬂuidized bed techniques havebeen used to coat fuel particles of uranium dioxidewith separate PG layers of different anisotropy. In a
ﬂuidized bed, a rising ﬂow of hydrocarbon gas and
inert gas levitates the charge of particles; the bedtemperature is very uniform and close temperature
control is possible. Fluidized beds operating at a
relatively low temperature of 1500
°C have also been
used to coat prosthetic devices such as dental implantsand disc occluders for heart valves with a 1 mm layer
of carbon. It is necessary to polish these coatings
before use in order to remove any weakening ﬂaws.Their wear resistance and strengthhave been enhancedby including silane in the bed atmosphere. Carbon is
one of the dominant chemical elements in the human
body and it is perhaps not surprising that it is avaluable prosthetic material, being compatible with
living tissue and with blood and other body ﬂuids.
Structural disorder, in its various aspects, is largely
determined by the conditions of synthesis; thus therelative orientation of the crystallites to each other,
as developed by synthesis, may be parallel (laminar),
random (isotropic), etc. Both laminar and isotropicdeposits of pyrolytic graphite are hard and strong
because L
cis small. (Typically, Lcvalues for PG are
about 3–10 nm.) Although highly anisotropic depositsare possible, further enhancement can be achievedby ‘stress-recrystallization’. For instance, near-ideal
graphite with anisotropy ratios of thermal conductivityas high as 200 can be produced by encasing a PG
deposit in an envelope of commercial polycrystallinegraphite and hot-pressing at temperatures in the orderof 3000
°C. The envelope deforms plastically and the
compression forces align the crystallites. In laminar
forms of pyrolytic graphite, the anisotropy is suchthat the material acts as an excellent conductor indirections parallel to the hexagonal networks and asan equally efﬁcient insulator in the c-direction. Thus,
the temperature gradient in the direction perpendic-
ular to the hexagonal networks can be very steep
(say, 300
°Cm m/NUL1). One practical consequence of this
gradient occurs during the growth of a PG depositon a heated mandrel, when the temperature at the
gas/deposit interface gradually decreases, causing the
structure of the deposited carbon to change as well.(This is one reason PG deposits are often very thin:thethickestdepositsare usuallyabout30–40 mm.) Onthe other hand, engineering advantage can be taken ofthe anisotropy of laminar PG. For example, pyrolytic
graphite was advocated by Ubbelohde for small cham-
bers or crucibles in induction furnaces operating attemperatures of 2000–3000
°C. Chamber walls with
their internal surfaces parallel to the a-layers favour
lateral heat transfer and give temperature uniformity
within the working space, a feature usually sought by
furnace designers.1At the same time, the external wall
surfaces operate at much lower temperatures; radiation
losses in accordance with Stefan’s law ( T4)a r em i n -
imized, to the beneﬁt of the thermal efﬁciency of the
furnace unit.

one would expect the high thermal conductance of its
interior to sustain slow combustion.
Ceramics and glasses 343
The glassy, low-porositymaterial known as vitreous
carbon is derived from the pyrolysisof a thermosettingpolymer, rather than from a hydrocarbon gas (e.g.
phenol formaldehyde resin). In a typical production
procedure, a specially prepared resin is shaped bymoulding, carbonized in an inert atmosphere at a
temperature of 900
°C and ﬁnally ﬁred in a vacuum
at a temperature of 1800 °C. Very large amounts of
gas are evolved; because of their disruptive effect,
the thickness of the product is necessarily restrictedto about 5–8 mm. Shrinkage ﬁgures in the order of
20–50% have been quoted. These features demand
close control of ﬁring conditions.
The structure of vitreous carbon inherits certain
bonding characteristics from the complex organic pre-
cursor. Thus graphitization and ordering are inhibited.
The crystallites are much smaller than those developed
inpyrolyticgraphite.Theyare onlyabout5 nmacross.The crystallites have a larger-than-ideal interlayer dis-
tance of about 0.35 nm. It appears that cross-links
persist between the layers and that these bonds havea stabilizing and strengthening effect. Furthermore,
because the crystallitesare randomly oriented,vitreous
carbon is isotropic. Like silica glass, vitreous carbon
is hard, brittle and fractures in a conchoidal manner.
Vitreous carbon is valued for its ability to with-
stand penetration and attack by aggressive liquids such
as concentrated hydroﬂuoric acid, caustic alkalis and
molten metals (e.g. Al, Cu, Pb, Sn. Zn). Its very lowporosity and high purity contribute to this inertness.
Generally, it has good resistance to attack by metals
which do not form carbides. However, like graphite,
it is attacked by alkali metals. In the chemical labo-
ratory, vitreous carbon is used for crucibles, furnaceboats, ﬁlters, non-stick burette taps, etc. in chemical
analysis, crystal growing and zone-reﬁning activities,
often proving superior to traditional materials such asplatinum, nickel, glass and quartz. Serving the elec-
tronics industry, vitreous carbon ware has been used in
the manufacture of gallium phosphide and arsenide for
optical/microwave devices, germanium for transistors
and special glasses for ﬁbre optics. In fact, it was theurgent need for an inert container for gallium phos-
phide which stimulated the development of vitreous
carbon. In the chemical industry, it is used for rotatingseals in pumps handling difﬁcult liquids. In addition
to being harder and stronger than all other forms of
carbon, with the exception of diamond, it is conduc-
tive and refractory at temperatures up to 3000
°Ca n d
can be used to make resistance- or induction-heatedreaction vessels. Ultrasonic machining of vitreous car-
bon is feasible, producing sound and clean-cut edges.
(Graphite has a more layered structure and machiningtends to round or break up edges.)
10.4.6.8 Chemical reactivity and intercalation of
graphite
Study of the manner in which foreign atoms interact
with and penetrate the layered structure of graphite hasproved fruitful.As theinterlayer distancein graphiteis
quite large, with relatively weak forces acting betweenlayers, it is chemically convenient to regard each layerasaverylargemacroaromaticmolecule.(Thisassump-
tion is reasonable because the covalent C–C bond
lengthof0.1415 nminthelayersissimilartothatfoundin the aromatic organic molecule of benzene, C
6H6.)
Withinindividuallayersofmostformsofgraphite,there
are usually clusters of vacant sites which form ‘holes’.
Althoughchemical reactions with foreign atoms whichpenetratebetweenlayerscantakeplaceatthese‘holes’,they are more likely to occur at the layer edges wherefreevalencybondsproject.Forinstance,attackbyoxy-
gen is favoured when the edges of layers impinge on
free surfaces, voids or cracks. If reaction with for-eign atoms does occur withinthe layers, newly-formedbonds can cause the layers to buckle.
In contrast to these rather random forms of
attack and reaction, it is possible to interpose(intercalate) substantial numbers of foreign atoms ormolecules between the parallel macromolecules to
form stoichiometric graphite compounds, as indicated
inFigure 10.16.(Ubbelohdecoinedtheterm‘syntheticmetals’ for this new class of material.) Theseintercalation compounds are produced by exposing
graphite to a vapour phase or chemical solution or by
electrolysis. By using potassium as the intercalate, afamily of potassium graphites has been produced (e.g.C
60K, C48K, C36K, C24K, C8K). This regular sequence

graphite separate and slip into the unstaggered sequence to

344Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
of stoichiometric ratios shows that as intercalation
proceeds, the distance between the potassium-ﬁlled
regions decreases stepwise in a systematic manner.The intercalates force the macromolecules apart and
sometimes cause them to shear past each other,
changing the ABABAB ...stacking sequence to
AAAA ...Intercalation species include alkali metals,
halogens, caesium and rubidium, nitrate, bisulphate
and phosphate radicals.
Intercalation produces interesting electrical effects
involving two forms of charge transfer. Graphite itselfhas moderate electrical conductivity at low tempera-
tures with about one charge carrier per 10
4atoms of
carbon. (In copper, the ratio is 1:1.) Intercalation with
potassium to form potassium graphite ⊿C8K/triangleleftraises the
number of charge carriers to one in ten ( /NULve), with the
electron-donating alkali metal injecting electrons into
the ‘empty’ band of energy levels in graphite. Con-
versely, when bromine intercalates to form the com-poundC
8Br, the electrical conductivityagainincreases
signiﬁcantly as a result of the halogen atoms acting
as electron acceptors and removing electrons from the‘full’ electron band of graphite. In this case, the num-
ber of carriers rises to about one in ten ( Cve). The
electron transfer associated with intercalation can pro-duce striking colour changes: the potassium graphites
C
24K (intermediate) and C 8K (saturated) are blue and
golden bronze, respectively. These unique processesof charge transfer have provided valuable insights into
the chemistry of bonding.
As a general rule, near-ideal graphite intercalates
more readily than less perfect forms; that is, the inter-
calate can penetrate more easily between the macro-
molecules without hindrance from interlayer bonds.Certain substances have the ability to ‘unpin’ the
layers, acting as intercalation catalysts (e.g. iodine
monochloride). These catalysts have been used inlarge-scale chemical processing. Intercalation with
halogens (bromine or chlorine) has been used to
strengthen the vital bond between ﬁlaments and theresin matrix in carbon ﬁbre ‘reinforced’ polymers.
Intercalation forms the basis of rapid proving tests
that have been used by the nuclear industry to sim-ulate the action of neutron bombardment upon pro-
totype graphites. The intercalating bromine atoms
force the layers of graphite to open up in the c-
direction.
10.4.6.9 From buckminsterfullerene to fullerite
Circa1985,examinationofvaporizedcarbonledtothe
exciting discovery of a new and unexpected molecular
form.1Mass spectrometry revealed that stable clus-
ters of carbon atoms, relative molecular mass 720,
were present in signiﬁcant quantity. It was postu-lated that these molecules were spherical and cage-
shaped, with 60 carbon atoms forming the vertices

ture that is reminiscent of geodesic buildings andof a soccer ball (Figure 10.17). The C
60molecule
was named buckminsterfullerene.2Larger fullerene
molecules have since been produced which have more
than 200 carbon atoms per shell.
The discovery of this third form of carbon, with
symmetrical characteristics completely different to
those of diamond and graphite, prompted attempts
to evolve synthetic routes capable of producing solid
buckminsterfullerene in macroscopical quantities large
enough for more detailed scientiﬁc study and for com-
mercial exploitation. Powder and thin-ﬁlm samples ofa solid crystalline form, fullerite, were subsequently
produced in gram quantities.

10.5 Aspects of glass technology
10.5.1 Viscous deformation of glass
Viscosity4is a prime property of glass. Although the
following account deals mainly with the working andannealing of glass, it is broadly relevant to glazes andtothe glassyintergranularphasefound inmany ceram-ics. Two mathematical expressions help to describe thenature of viscous ﬂow in glasses. First, there is the
formula for Newtonian ﬂow in an ideal ﬂuid:
υ/CR/υt D/FSÐ/RSD/FSÐ1//DC1
where υ/CR/υtis the shear strain rate, /FSis the applied
shear stress, /RSis the ﬂuidity coefﬁcient and /DC1is
the viscosity coefﬁcient. In its melting range, atypical SiO
2–Na2O–CaO glass has a viscosity of
5–50Nsm/NUL2. (The viscosity of liquid metals is
roughly 1 mN s m/NUL2.) As glass is hot-drawn, its cross-
sectional area decreases at a rate which depends solelyupon the drawing force and viscosity, not upon area.For this reason, the glass extends uniformly and doesnot ‘neck’.
The second expression, which is of the Arrhenius-
type, concerns the temperature-dependency of visco-sity, as follows:
/DC1DAexp⊿Q/kT/triangleleft
where Ais a constant, Qis the activation energy,
kis the Boltzmann constant and Tis the absolute
temperature. The activation energy for viscous ﬂow is
accordingly obtained by plotting log /DC1against 1 /Tand
4Dynamic (absolute) viscosity is the force required to
move 1 m2of plane surface at a velocity of 1 m s/NUL1to a
second plane surface which is parallel to the ﬁrst andseparated 1 m from it by a layer of the ﬂuid phase.

reciprocal of viscosity.measuring the slope of the line. Although the above
two expressions are valid for many types of glass,for certain glasses there are conditions of temperatureand stress which result in non-Newtonian and/or non-Arrhenian behaviour.
As indicated in Section 2.6, the viscosity of oxide
glasses depends upon composition and temperature.
Generally, an increase in the concentration of modi-
fying cations and/or a rise in temperature will causethe viscosity to fall. Figure 10.18 shows the rela-tion between viscosity and temperature for a typicalSiO
2–Na2O–CaO glass. Two key values of viscosity
are marked; they correspond to two practical temper-atures which are known as (1) the Littleton softening
point ⊿viscosity D10
6.6Nsm/NUL2/triangleleftand(2)theannealing
point ⊿viscosity D1012.4Nsm/NUL2/triangleleft.
The softening point is determined by a standard-
ized procedure and gives the maximum temperature atwhich the glass can be handled without serious changein dimensions. For ordinary silica glass, it is about
1000 K.Attheannealingtemperature,theionsaresuf-
ﬁcientlymobiletoallowresidualstressestoberelievedin about 15 min. The point in the curve at which theslope is a maximum corresponds to the inﬂection (ﬁc-tive or glass transition temperature) in the speciﬁc vol-ume/temperature curve for the particular glass-formingsystem. The working range for commercial silica glass
corresponds to a viscosity range of 10
3–107Nsm/NUL2.
The curve for this glass is quite steep, indicating thattemperature control to within, say, š10
°C is necessary
during working (i.e. drawing, blowing, rolling, etc.).Figure 10.19 provides a comparison of the viscositycurves for different types of glass. The difﬁculties ofworking pure silica glass (‘fused quartz’) are immedi-
ately apparent. Even at a temperature of 1300
°Ct h i s
glass has a viscosity of about 1012Nsm/NUL2,w h i c hi s
still too high for working. Glasses with special chemi-cal and physical properties often have a steep viscositycurve and tend to devitrify, presenting difﬁculties dur-ing drawing at traditional working temperatures. One

solution has been to hot-extrude such glasses through
graphite dies into rod or tube form.1By using very
high pressures (up to 10 GN m/NUL2), it is possible to
overcome a high viscosity of 107Nsm/NUL2and to use
a lower extrusion temperature (e.g. 950 °C). Such tem-
peratures, which can be as much as 200 °C lower than
the temperature required for traditional methods, pre-
vent devitriﬁcationand, by suppressingsurface tensioneffects, help to form rods and tubes with sharp andaccurate proﬁles.
10.5.2 Some special glasses
Mostglassesproducedarebaseduponsilicaandﬂuxedwith alkali metal oxides, with their chemical formu-
lation adjusted to suit the application (e.g. bottles,
plate glass, lamps, etc.). In its purest form, vitreoussilica has a very low linear coefﬁcient of thermal

temperature applications. ‘Fused quartz’ is made by
melting sand; high-purity ‘fused silica’ is made by
vapour deposition after reacting SiCl 4with oxygen at
temperatures above 1500 °C. (These two deﬁnitions are
tentative.)
Window (‘soda-lime’) glass, typically 72SiO 2–
14Na2O–10CaO–2MgO–1Al 2O3, owes its conve-
nient range of working temperature ⊿700–1000 °C/triangleleftto
the two network-modiﬁers, Na 2O and CaO. The effec-
tiveness of their ﬂuxing action can be gauged by thefact that the softening point of this glass ⊿700
°C/triangleleftis
at least 800 °C lower than that of high-purity silica
glass. The softening point, as deﬁned in the ASTMtestmethod, isthetemperatureatwhicha glassﬁbreofuniform diameter elongates at a speciﬁc rate under its

‘system’ nomenclature recommended by F. V. Tooley(i.e.oxidecomponentsarestatedinorderofdecreasing%w / w . )
1Philips Research Laboratories, Aachen, Germany.Pyrexglass, 81SiO 2–13B2O3–4Na2O–2Al 2O3,
combines two network-formers and is well known forits chemical durability. Because of its relatively low
expansivity ( ˛D3.3ð10
/NUL6°C/NUL1; 0–300 °C), it is tol-
erant to thermal shock and is widely used for chemi-
cal glassware in laboratories and industrial processing
plant. Sometimes it is referred to as a ‘borosilicate’glass, unfortunately implying crystallinity.
In certain glasses, being an intermediate, PbO can
actually form a network. This oxide is a ﬂux and,unlike Na
2O, does not reduce the electrical resistiv-
ity;glassesintheSiO 2–PbO–Na 2O–Al2O3systemare
widely used for electronic and electrical components.
Their high lead content favours absorption of X-rays
and/CR-rays, making them suitable for radio-logical
shielding (65% PbO) and colour television tubes (23%
PbO). Lead also increases the refractive index and dis-
persion of SiO 2-based glasses. These effects are used
to advantage in optical lenses and in the decorative
glass known confusingly as ‘lead crystal’. In the latter
case, 20–30% PbO provides craftsmen with a ‘long’glass, that is, one with a large temperature interval for
working/manipulation, within which viscosity changes
very slightly.
Alumina ⊿Al
2O3/triangleleft, an intermediate, frequently
features in the composition of glasses. In smallamounts, say 1–2% w/w, it improves the resistance
of SiO
2-based glasses to attack by water. However, its
presence increases melt viscosity and makes meltingand ﬁning more difﬁcult; for instance, gas bubbles
separatelessreadily.Thedependenceofviscosityupon
composition is always an important matter in glass
technology. Al
3Ccations enter the tetrahedral holes in
the network, replacing tetravalent silicon cations. As
a result, the number of non-bridging O2/NULanions is
reduced and the strength and rigidity of the networkis enhanced. By substantially raising the alumina
content to 15–25% w/w, it is possible to develop
valuable stability at high temperatures. For exam-
ple, 62SiO
2–17Al 2O3–8CaO–7MgO–5B 2O3–1Na2O
glass has a softening point in excess of 900 °C, which
is about 100 °C higher than that of Pyrexglass. This
‘aluminosilicate’ glass is used for combustion tubes.
10.5.3 Toughened and laminated glasses
Glasses, in general, are weak when placed in ten-
sion during bending and do not withstand impactblows. However, in compression, glasses can exhibit
exceptional strength. Accordingly, sheet glass is often
strengthened and toughened by developing high resid-ual compressive stresses in the surface layers. They
oppose any applied tensile stresses (say, on the convex
face of a bent sheet of glass), and must be overcome
before this vulnerable surface begins to develop dan-
gerous tensile stresses. Various physical and chemicalprocesses, applicable on a mass-production scale, are
available to improve the load-bearing capacity and
behaviour under impact conditions.
Ceramics and glasses 347

The term ‘toughening’ generally refers to both heat-
treatment and chemical methods. In thermal temper-ing, a toughening process used extensively for sideand rear glazing in cars, glass sheets are cut and
shaped, heated uniformly to a temperature above T
g
(say, 700 °C), soaked for 2–4 min and then quenched
with jets of air. Glass has a low thermal conductiv-ity and the eventual contraction of the core regions isrestrained by the rigid outer layers, producing the bal-ance of compressive ( /NULve) and tensile ( Cve) stresses
shown in Figure 10.20a. The glass sheet must be free
from ﬂaws in order to withstand the severe quenchstresses and must be at least 2–3 mm thick so that thedesired stress gradients develop. Surface stresses up
to 200 MN m
/NUL2are produced by this method. Heat-
ing toughened glass to a temperature of 200 °C will
relieve these stresses. Small blunt-edged fragments areproducedwhentoughenedglassfractures underimpact.
Toughenedproductscannotbecutorshaped;notching,
drilling, etc. must be done before treatment.
Chemical strengthening/toughening is also used to
develop protective compressive stresses. These treat-ments are more versatile, being suitable for thin and
thick sections of glass and for unusual shapes (e.g.
Chemcor.) However, because ion exchange and diffu-
sion are involved, they require longer process times.Their purpose is to alter the surface composition andreduce its coefﬁcient of thermal expansion. On cool-
ing from a high temperature, the greater contraction
of the hot core is restrained and very high compres-sive stresses develop in the modiﬁed surface layers(Figure 10.20b). In one version of chemical strength-ening, sodium-containing glass is heated in an atmo-
sphere of water vapour and sulphur dioxide and anexchange between H
Cions and NaCions takes place
in the glass surface (i.e. ‘H-for-Na’). In another high-
temperature version, a ‘Li-for-Na’ exchange occurs
when the glass is immersed in a melt of lithium salt.In low-temperature chemical strengthening, large ionsfrom molten salt displace smaller ions from the sur-
faces of immersed glass, causing them to expand (e.g.‘K-for-Na’, ‘Na-for-Li’). On cooling from a relatively
low temperature, the core is rigid and the presence
of absorbed, larger ions in the surface layers developscompressive stresses. Chemical strengthening methods
often use glasses of special composition.
The bottle-manufacturing industry uses chemical
surface treatments to strengthen returnable bottles
(improving trippage) and to provide a useful lubricity
as they pass through bottle-ﬁlling plant at high speed.
(Rubbing two glass bottles together reveals whether a
lubricating coating is present.)
The alternative to the above toughening methods,
based upon a composite approach, is to interleave two
matched sheets of ‘ﬂoat’ glass with an interlayer ofplastic, nearly 1 mm thick. Polyvinyl butyrate (PVB)
is commonly used for the interlayer. In the mid-1960s,
this more costly method gained favour for car wind-
screens as a result of accident statistics which indi-
cated that a laminated windscreen was less likely to
cause fatal injury than a toughened one.
1Cracking
is conﬁned to the area of impact. The PVB inter-
layer deforms elastically, absorbs impact energy andholds glass fragments in place, reducing the risk of
facial lacerations. Visibility is retained after impact.
De-icing windscreens have ﬁne heating ﬁlaments oftungsten embedded between the glass layers (Triplex
Hotscreen ). Laminated glass with a thicker plastic
interlayer is used for aircraft windscreens; these mustwithstand extreme thermal conditions, ranging from
high altitudes ⊿/NUL80
°C/triangleleftto kinetic heating ⊿150°C/triangleleft,
and the possible high-speed ‘strikes’ of birds weighing
about 2 kg.
The manufacture of laminated glass demands clean-
liness so that the PVB will bond strongly to the glass.
Curved windscreens are made by separately bending
matchedpairsofglasssheetatatemperaturejustabove600
°C. After cooling, PVB is applied to one sheet of
each pair in an air-conditioned room and the matching
sheet added. Air can be removed from the PVB/glass
interfaces of the curved assembly by applying a vac-
uum to its edges. The glazing is ﬁnally autoclaved at
a pressure of 1.2–1.4 MN m/NUL2and a temperature of
135–145 °C in order to complete the bonding.
The oil crisis of the mid-1970s underlined the
need for weight saving and fuel efﬁciency in car
design. As a direct consequence, the thickness of lam-
inated windscreens decreased from 3.0 mm/3.0 mmto 2.1 mm/2.1 mm. (Toughened glass decreased in
thickness from 5–6 mm to 3–4 mm.) Advances in
glass technology have made it possible for moderncar designs to increase the area of glazing, use ﬂush,

10.6 The time-dependency of strength
in ceramics and glasses
Time and strain-rate have a special relevance to
the strength of ceramics. For example, the measuredstrength of individuals taken from a set of ceramicspecimens can show an appreciable decrease over aperiod of time. With regard to the mechanism of such
time-dependent failure, it is ﬁrst necessary to distin-
guish between fast and slow crack growth.
Fast crack growth, as produced in a routine bend
test, takes place when the crack reaches a criticalsize. Slow or delayed crack growth takes place ina stressed ceramic over a relatively long period oftime and involves slow propagation of a crack of
sub-critical dimensions. Fast fracture occurs when this
crack reaches criticality. This phenomenon of progres-siveweakeninganddegradation,whichistermedstaticfatigue or delayed fracture, has long been known inglasses. It is now recognized in a wide variety ofceramics (e.g. alumina, slicon nitride, vitreous car-
bon). Its occurrence in polycrystalline oxide ceramics
is often related to the presence of a glassy bondingphase. The stresses capable of causing static fatiguecan be continuous or ﬂuctuating: even at quite lowstress levels, there is a ﬁnite probability of failure bythis insidious process. Sometimes chemical agencieshave an overriding effect. For example, when mois-
ture is able to diffuse to crack tips in silica glasses and
alumina, the velocity of crack growth increases. Thistype of behaviour is understandably regarded as stress-corrosion. Slow crack growth is a thermally-activatedprocessandan increase intheambienttemperature canhave a very signiﬁcant effect.
The nature of delayed crack growth is customarily
expressed by plotting crack velocity ( V) against the
stress intensity factor ⊿K
I/triangleleft, as shown in Figure 10.21.
This plot is idealised but is typical of ceramics whichare capable of slow crack growth at ambient tempera-ture, suchasglassesandoxideceramics. Three regionsof crack growth lie between the ‘static fatigue limit’
⊿K
Io/triangleleft,belowwhichcrackgrowthisnotofconcern,and
the critical value of the stress-intensity factor ⊿KIc/triangleleftat
which sudden fracture occurs. In region I, the veloc-ity is an exponential function of the stress-intensityfactor and can be expressed in the form VDA⊿K
I/triangleleftn.
In region II, velocity is independent of KI. Regions
I and II are environment-sensitive and correspond to
conditions of stress-corrosion. In region III, velocity is

body contours.

again dependent upon KIbut is independent of envi-
ronment.
Time-to-failure depends primarily upon the proﬁle
of region I. Its slope ( n), sometimes known as the
stress-corrosion constant of the particular material,
rangesinvaluefromabout10to100.Lowvalues,such
asthoseforglasses(10–40),indicateasusceptibilityto
slow crack growth. Figure 10.22 shows typical curvesfor a variety of ceramic materials. Changes in envi-
ronment (temperature, pH, etc.) can displace a curve
and/or alter its slope. For instance, at elevated temper-
atures, the slopes of curves for carbides and nitrides
become less steep.
Study of the statistical nature and time-dependency
of strength in ceramics led to the development of
strength-probability-time (SPT) diagrams
2of the type
shown in Figure 10.23. These diagrams refer to spe-
ciﬁc conditions of testing and are plotted on Weibull
probability paper. As the n-value (for region I crack
growth) decreases, indicating increased sensitivity toenvironment, the sloping lines close up. Such dia-
grams clearly show the interplay between stress, the
probability of survival and the lifetime before
fracture.
Recognition of the fact that there is apparently no
absolutely safe stress for a ceramic which is sub-
ject to long-term service stimulated interest in proof-
testing. By eliminating weaker members, such tests
provide survivors with a better (narrower) distribution
of strength than that of the original population. Statis-
tical predictions of service life beneﬁt accordingly. It
must be borne in mind that the proportion of survivors
reﬂects the conditionsof testing. Obviously,the period
of testing is important; the longer the time, the smaller
the number of survivors. Ideally, proof-tests should be
carried out under conditions that do not cause sub-
critical crack growth.

Plastics and composites
11.1 Utilization of polymeric
materials
11.1.1 Introduction
In Chapter 2 the basic chemistry and structural
arrangements of long-chain molecules were describedand it was shown how polymers can be broadlyclassiﬁedasthermoplastics,elastomersandthermosets.Certain aspects of their practical utilization will nowbe examined, with special attention to processing;this stage plays a decisive role in deciding if a
particular polymeric material can be produced as a
marketable commodity. The ﬁnal section (11.3) willconcern composites, extending from the well-knownglass-reinforced polymers to those based upon ceramicand metallic matrices.
11.1.2 Mechanical aspects of Tg
As indicated in Chapter 2, it is customary to quote a
glass-transition temperature Tgfor a polymer because
it separates two very different r ´egimes of mechanical
behaviour. (The value of Tgis nominal, being subject
to the physical method and procedure used in its deter-mination). Below T
g, the mass of entangled molecules
is rigid. Above Tg, viscoelastic effects come into play
and it is therefore the lower temperature limit for pro-
cessing thermoplastics. The structural effect of raisingthe temperature of a glassy polymer is to provide aninput of thermal energy and to increase the vibrationsofconstituentatomsandmolecules.Molecularmobiltyincreases signiﬁcantly as T
gis approached: rotation
about C–C bonds in the chain molecules begins, thefree volumeofthestructureincreasesandintermolecu-lar forces weaken. It becomes easier for applied forcesto deform the structure and elastic moduli to fall.
The mechanical properties of polymers are highly
dependent upon time and temperature, the responseto stress being partly viscous and partly elastic. Forinstance, ‘natural’ time periods are associated with thevarious molecular relaxation processes associated with
the glass transition. In linear viscoelastic behaviour,total strain comprises a linear elastic (Hookean) com-ponent and a linear viscous (Newtonian) component.
The stress–strainratiosdepend upontimealone. In the
more complex non-linear case, which usually appliesto polymers, strain is a function of time and stressbecause molecular movements are involved.
The phenomenon of stress relaxation can be used
to chart the way in which the behaviour of a givenpolymer changes from glassy to rubbery. Figure 11.1
shows the non-linear response of a polymer that is

log time t, as in Figure 11.2a. The thermoplastic

polymer changes in character from a glassy solid,
where the relaxation modulus is a maximum, to arubbery solid. In the complementary Figure 11.2b,data from standard tensile tests on the same polymerat different temperatures are used to provide valuesof elastic moduli ⊿E/triangleleft. The similarity of proﬁles in
Figures 11.2a and 11.2b illustrates the equivalence oftime and temperature. (Theoretically, the modulus fora short time and a high temperature may be taken toequate to that for a combination of a long time and alowtemperature;thisconceptisusedinthepreparationof relaxation modulus versus time graphs.) The glasstransition temperature T
ghas been superimposed upon
Figures 11.2a and 11.2b.
Although single values of Tgare usually quoted,
the process of molecular rearrangement is complex
and minor transitions are sometimes detectable. Thus,for PVC, the main glass transition occurs at tem-peratures above 80
°C but there is a minor transition
at/NUL40°C. Consequently, at room temperature, PVC
exhibits some rigidity yet can elongate slightly beforefracture. Addition of a plasticizer liquid, which has avery low T
g, lowers the Tgvalue of a polymer. Sim-
ilarly, Tgfor a copolymer lies between the Tgvalues
of the original monomers; its value will depend upon
monomer proportions.
In elastomeric structures, as the temperature is
increased, therelativelyfewcrosslinksbegintovibratevigorously at T
gand the elastomer becomes increas-
ingly rubbery. As one would anticipate, Tgvalues
for rubbers lie well below room temperature. Increas-
ing the degree of crosslinking in a given polymerhas the effect of raising the entire level of the lower‘rubbery’ plateau of the modulus versus temperatureplot upwards as the polymer becomes more glassyin nature. The thermosets PMMA ( Perspex, Lucite )
and PS have T
gvalues of 105 °C and 81 °C, respec-
tively, and are accordingly hard and brittle at room
temperature.
11.1.3 The role of additives
Industrially, the term ‘plastic’ is applied to a polymerto which one or more property-modifying agents havebeen added. Numerous types of additive are used by
manufacturers and fabricators; in fact, virgin polymersare rarely used. An additive has a speciﬁc function.Typical functions are to provide (1) protection fromthe service environment (anti-oxidants, anti-ozonants,anti-static agents, ﬂame-retardants, ultraviolet radia-tion absorbers), (2) identiﬁcation (dyes, pigments),(3) easier processability (plasticizers), (4) toughness,and (5) ﬁller.
In many instances the required amount of additive
ranges from 0.1% to a few per cent. Although ultra-
violet (UV) components of sunlight can structurally
alter and degrade polymers, the effect is particularlymarked in electric light ﬁttings (e.g. yellowing). Stabi-lizing additives are advisable as some artiﬁcial lightsources emit considerable amounts of UV radiationwith wavelengths in the range 280–400 nm. For anypolymer, there is a critical wavelength which will havethe most damaging effect. For instance, a wavelengthof 318.5 nm will degrade PS, which is a commonchoiceofmaterialfordiffusersandrefractors,byeithercausingcross-linkingorbyproducingfree radicalsthatreact with oxygen.
The action of a plasticizer (3) is to weaken inter-
molecular bonding by increasing the separation of thechain molecules. The plasticizer may take the form ofa liquid phase that is added after polymerization andbefore processing.Additionsof a particulatetoughener(4) such as rubber may approach 50% and the materialis then normally regarded as a composite.
A wide variety of ﬁllers (5) is used for polymers. In
the case of thermosets, substances such as mica, glassﬁbre and ﬁne sawdust are used to improve engineeringproperties and to reduce the cost of moulded prod-ucts. PTFE has been used as a ﬁller (15%) to improvethe wear resistance of nylon components. Althoughusually electrically non-conductive, polymers can bemade conductive by loading them with an appropriateﬁller (e.g. electromagnetic shielding, specimen mountsin SEM analysis). Fillers and other additives play animportant role in the production of vulcanized rubbers.Inert ﬁllers facilitate handling of the material beforevulcanization (e.g. clay, barium sulphate). Reinforcing

ﬁllers restrict the movement of segments between the
branching points shown in Figure 2.24. For instance,carbonblackhaslongbeenusedasaﬁllerforcartyres,givingsubstantialimprovementsinshearmodulus,tear
strength, hardness and resistance to abrasion by road
surfaces. Tyres are subject to ﬂuctuating stresses dur-ing their working life and it has been found useful
to express their stress–strain behaviour in terms of
a dynamic shear modulus (determined under cyclicstressing conditions at a speciﬁed frequency). Time isrequired for molecular rearrangements to take place
in an elastomer; for this reason the dynamic modu-
lus increases with the frequency used in the modulustest. The dynamic modulus at a given frequency issigniﬁcantly enhanced by the crosslinking action of
vulcanization and by the presence of carbon black.
These carbon particles are extremely small, typically
20–50 nm diameter. Small amounts of anti-oxidants
1
and anti-ozonants are often beneﬁcial. The principal
agents of degradation under service conditions areextreme temperatures, oxygen and ozone, various liq-uids. In the last case a particular liquid may penetrate
between the chains and cause swelling.
11.1.4 Some applications of important
plastics
Figures 11.3a and 11.3b summarize 1990 data on
worldandWestEuropeanconsumptionofplastics.Thesurvey included high-volume, low-price commodity
plastics as well as engineering and advanced plastics.
Thermoplastics dominate the market (i.e. PE, PVC andPP). Development of an entirely new type of plastic isextremely expensive and research in this direction is
1In the 1930s, concern with oxidation led the Continental
Rubber Works, Hannover, to experiment withnitrogen-inﬂation of tyres intended for use on Mercedes‘Silver Arrows’, Grand Prix racing cars capable of 300km/h. This practice was not adopted by Mercedes-Benz for
track events.limited. Research is mainly concerned with improv-
ing and reducing the cost of established materials
(e.g. improved polymerization catalysts, composites,
thermoplastic rubbers, waste recycling).
The low- and high-density forms of polyethylene,
LDPE and HDPE, were developed in the 1940s and1950s, respectively. Extruded LDPE is widely used as
thin ﬁlms and coatings (e.g. packaging). HDPE is used
for blow-mouldedcontainers, injection-mouldedcrates
andextrudedpipes.Anintermediateformofadjustable
density known as linear low-density polyethylene,
LLDPE, became available in the 1980s. Although
more difﬁcult to process than LDPE and HDPE, ﬁlm-
extruded LLDPE is now used widely in agriculture,
horticulture and the construction industry (e.g. heavy-
dutysacks,silagesheets,tunnelhouses,cloches,damp-
proof membranes, reservoir linings). Its tear strengthand toughness have enabled the gauge of PE ﬁlm to be
reduced. A further variant of PE is ultra-high molecu-
lar weight polyethylene, UHMPE, which is virtually
devoid of residual traces of catalyst from polymer-
ization. Because of its high molecular mass, it needs
to processed by sintering. UHMPE provides the wear
resistance and toughness required in artiﬁcial joints of
surgical prostheses.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the dominant plastic in
the building and construction industries and has effec-
tivelyreplacedmanytraditionalmaterialssuchassteel,cast iron, copper, lead and ceramics. For example,
the unplasticized version (UPVC) is used for win-
dow frames and external cladding panels because of
its stiffness, hardness, low thermal conductivity and
weather resistance. PVC is the standard material for
piping in underground distribution systems for potable
water (blue) and natural gas (yellow), being corrosion-
resistant and offering small resistance to ﬂuid ﬂow.
AlthoughsizesofPVCpipestendtoberestricted,PVC
linings are used to protect the bore of large-diameter
pipes (e.g. concrete). The relatively low softeningtem-perature of PVC has stimulated interest in alternative
piping materials for underﬂoor heating systems. Poly-
butylene (PB) has been used for this application; being
354Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
supported, it can operate continuously at a temperature
of 80°C and can tolerate occasional excursions to
110°C. However, hot water with a high chlorine con-
tentcancausefailure.Otherimportantbuildingplastics
are PP, ABS and polycarbonates. Transparent rooﬁng
sheets of twin-walled polycarbonate or PVC provide
thermal insulation and diffuse illumination: both mate-
rialsneed to be stabilizedwithadditivestoprevent UV
degradation.

becameavailableintheearly1960s.Itsstiffness,tough-
ness at low temperatures and resistance to chemicals,
heat and creep ⊿TmD165–170 °C/triangleleftare exceptional. PP
has been of particular interest to car designers in their
quest for weight-saving and fuel efﬁciency. In a typi-
cal modern saloon car, at least 10% of the total weight
is plastic (i.e. approximately 100 kg). PP, the lowest-
density thermoplastic (approximately 900 kg m/NUL3), is
increasingly used for interior and exterior automotive
components(e.g.heatingandventilationducts,radiator
fans, body panels, bumpers (fenders)). It is amenable
to ﬁlament-reinforcement, electroplating,blendingas a
copolymer (with ethylene or nylon), and can be pro-
duced as mouldings (injection- or blow-), ﬁlms and
ﬁlaments.
Polystyrene (PS) is intrinsically brittle. Engineering
polymers such as PS, PP, nylon and polycarbonates
are toughened by dispersing small rubber spheroids
throughout the polymeric matrix; these particles con-
centrate applied stresses and act as energy-absorbing
sites of crazing. The toughened high-impact form of
polystyrene is referred to as HIPS. PS, like PP, is nat-
urally transparent but easily coloured. When supplied
as expandable beads charged with a blowing agent,
such as pentane, PS can be produced as a rigid heat-
insulating foam.
Some of the elastomers introduced in Chapter 2 will
now be considered. Polyisoprene is natural rubber;
unfortunately, because of reactive C–C links in the
chains it does not have a high resistance to chemical
attackand isprone tosurface crackinganddegradation
(‘perishing’). Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), intro-
duced in 1930, is still one of the principal synthetic
rubbers (e.g. car tyres).1In this copolymer, repeat
units of butadiene2are combined randomly with those
of styrene. Polychloroprene ( Neoprene ), introduced in
1932, is noted for its resistance to oil and heat and
is used for automotive components (e.g. seals, water
circuit pipes).
Asindicatedpreviously,additivesplayavitalrolein

during World War I as a result of the materials blockade;when used for tyres, vehicles had to be jacked-up overnightto prevent ﬂat areas developing where they contacted theground.

butene monomer C 4H8contains two double bonds.rubbers has encouraged innovative engineering design
(e.g. motorway bridge bearings, mounts for oil-rigs
and earthquake-proof buildings, vehicle suspensionsystems).
Silicone rubbers may be regarded as being inter-
mediate in character to polymers and ceramics. FromTable 2.7 it can be seen that the long chains con-sist of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms. Although
weaker than organic polymers based upon carbon
chains, they retain important engineering properties,such as resilience, chemical stability and electricalinsulation, over the very useful temperature range of/NUL100
°C to 300 °C. These outstanding characteristics,
combined with their cost-effectiveness, have led to the
adoptionofsiliconerubbersbyvirtuallyeveryindustry
(e.g. medical implants, gaskets, seals, coatings).
11.1.5 Management of waste plastics
Concernfortheworld’senvironmentandfutureenergysupplies has focused attention on the fate of wasteplastics, particularly those from the packaging, carand electrical/electronics sectors. Although recovery
of values from metallic wastes has long been prac-
tised, the diversity and often complex chemical natureof plastics raise some difﬁcult problems. Nevertheless,despite the difﬁculties of re-use and recycling, it mustbe recognized that plastics offer remarkable propertiesandarefrequentlymorecost-andenergy-effectivethan
traditional alternatives such as metals, ceramics and
glasses.Worldwide,productionofplasticsaccountsforabout 4% of the demand for oil: transport accountsfor about 54%. Enlightened designers now considerthe whole life-cycle and environmental impact of apolymeric product, from manufacture to disposal, andendeavour to economize on mass (e.g. thinner thick-
nesses for PE ﬁlm and PET containers (‘lightweight-
ing’)). Resort to plastics that ultimately decomposein sunlight (photodegradation) or by microbial action(biodegradation) represents a loss of material resourceastheycannotberecycled;accordingly,theirusetendsto be restricted to specialized markets (e.g. agriculture,medicine).
Figure 11.3c portrays the general pattern of plas-
tics disposal in Western Europe. Landﬁlling is themain method but sites are being rapidly exhausted insome countries. The principal routes of waste man-agement are material recycling, energy recycling andchemical recycling. The ﬁrst opportunity for material
recycling occurs during manufacture, when uncontam-
inated waste may be re-used. However, as in the caseof recycled paper, there is a limit to the number oftimes that this is possible. Recycling of post-consumerwaste is costly, involving problems of contamination,
collection, identiﬁcation and separation.
3. Co-extruded
3German legislation requires that, by 1995, 80% of all
packaging (including plastics) must be collected separately
from other waste and 64% of total waste recycled as
material.
Plastics and composites 355
blow-moulded containers are being produced with a
three-layer wall in which recycled material is sand-
wiched between layers of virgin polymer. In the Ger-man car industry efforts are being made to recycle
ﬂexiblepolyurethanefoam,ABSandpolyamides.New
ABS radiator grilles can incorporate 30% from oldrecycled grilles.
Plastics have a high content of carbon and hydrogen
and can be regarded as fuels of useful caloriﬁc value.
Incinerating furnaces act as energy-recycling devices,converting the chemical energy of plastics into ther-
mal/electrical energy and recovering part of the energy
originally expended in manufacture. Noxious fumesand vapours can be evolved (e.g. halogens); controland cleaning of ﬂue gases are essential.
Chemical recycling is of special interest because
direct material recycling is not possible with somewastes. Furthermore, according to some estimates,
only 20–30% of plastic waste can be re-used after
material recycling. Chemical treatment, which is anindirect material recycling route, recovers monomersand polymer-based products that can be passed on as
feedstocks to chemical and petrochemical industries.
Hydrogenation of waste shows promise and is used toproduce synthetic oil.
11.2 Behaviour of plastics during
processing
11.2.1 Cold-drawing and crazing
A polymeric structure is often envisaged as an entan-
gled mass of chain molecules. As the Tgvalues
for many commercial polymers are fairly low, one
assumes that thermal agitation causes molecules towriggle at ambient temperatures. Raising the tempera-
ture increases the violence of molecular agitation and,
under the action of stress, molecules become morelikely to slide past each other, uncoil as they rotate
abouttheircarbon–carbonbonds,andextendinlength.
We will ﬁrst concentrate upon mechanistic aspectsof two important modes of deformation; namely, thedevelopment of highly-preferred molecular orienta-
tionsinsemi-crystallinepolymersbycold-drawingand
the occurrence of crazing in glassy polymers.
Cold-drawing can be observed when a semi-
crystalline structure containing spherulites is subjected
toa tensiletest atroom temperature. A neck appears inthe central portion of the test-piece. As the test-pieceextends, this neck remains constant in cross-section
but increases considerably in length. This process
forms a necked length that is stronger and stifferthan material beyond the neck. At ﬁrst, the effect of
applied tensile stress is to produce relative movement
between the crystalline lamellae and the interlamellarregions of disordered molecules. Lamellae that arenormal to the direction of principal stress rotate in a
manner reminiscent of slip-plane rotation in metallic
single crystals, and break down into smaller blocks.These blocks are then drawn into tandem sequences
known as microﬁbrils (Figure 11.4). The individualblocks retain their chain-folding conformation and arelinked together by the numerous tie molecules whichform as the original lamellae unfold. A bundle ofthese highly-oriented microﬁbrils forms a ﬁbril (smallﬁbre). The microﬁbrils in a bundle are separated
by amorphous material and are joined by surviving
interlamellar tie molecules. The pronounced molecularorientation of this type of ﬁbrous structure maximizesthe contribution of strong covalent bonds to strengthand stiffness while minimizing the effect of weakintermolecular forces.
Industrially, cold-drawing techniques which take
advantage of the anisotropic nature of polymer crys-
tallites are widely used in the production of syntheticﬁbres and ﬁlaments (e.g. Terylene). (Similarly, biax-
ial stretching is used to induce exceptional strength inﬁlm and sheet and bottles e.g. Melinex). Crystalliza-
tion in certain polymers can be very protracted. For
instance, because nylon6,6 has a T
gvalue slightly
below ambient temperature, it can continue to crystal-lize and densify over a long period of time during nor-mal service, causing undesirable after-shrinkage. Thismetastability is obviated by ‘annealing’ nylon brieﬂyatatemperatureof120
°C,whichisbelow Tm:lessper-
fect crystals melt while the more stable crystals grow.
Stretching nylon6,6 at room temperature during the
actual freezing process also encourages crystallizationand develops a strengthening preferred orientation ofcrystallites.

to a form of localized inhomogeneous deformation, oryielding. In crazing, thin bands of expanded material
form in the polymer at a stress much lower than the
bulk yield stress for the polymer. Crazes are usuallyassociated with glassy polymers (PMMA and PS) butmay occur in semi-crystalline polymers (PP). They are

several microns wide and fairly constant in width:they
can scatter incident light and are visible to the unaidedeye(e.g. transparentglassypolymers).Asinthestress-
corrosion of metals, crazing of regions in tension
may be induced by a chemical agent (e.g. ethanol onPMMA). The plane of a craze is always at right anglesto the principal tensile stress. Structurally, each craze
consists of interconnected microvoids, 10–20 nm in
size, and is bridged by large numbers of molecule-orientated ﬁbrils, 10–40 nm in diameter. The voidage
is about 40–50%. As a craze widens, bridging ﬁbrils
extend by drawing in molecules from the side walls.Unlikethetypeofcrazefoundinglazesonpottery,itis

Nevertheless, it is a zone of weakness and can initiatebrittle fracture. Each craze has a stress-intensifying
tip which can propagate through the bulk polymer.
Crazing can take a variety of forms and may evenbe beneﬁcial. For instance, when impact causes crazes
to form around rubber globules in ABS polymers,
the myriad newly-created surfaces absorb energy andtoughen the material. Various theoretical models of
craze formation have been proposed. One suggestion
is that triaxial stresses effectively lower T
gand, when
tensile strain has exceeded a critical value, induce a
glass-to-rubber transition in the vicinity of a ﬂaw, or
similar heterogeneity. Hydrostatic stresses then cause
microcavities to nucleate within this rubbery zone.

strength/temperature relations for a polymeric material

11.2.2 Processing methods for thermoplastics
Processing technology has a special place in the
remarkable history of the polymer industry: polymer

deformation regions as a function of normalized stress
versus normalized temperature (from Ashby and Jones,
1986; permission of Elsevier Science Ltd, UK) .chemistrydecidesthecharacterofindividualmolecules
but it is the processing stage which enables them to be
arranged to maximum advantage. Despite the variety
of methods available for converting feedstock pow-
ders and granules of thermoplastics into useful shapes,these methods usually share up to four common stages
of production; that is, (1) mixing, melting and homog-
enization, (2) transport and shaping of a melt, (3)
drawing or blowing, and (4) ﬁnishing.
Processing brings about physical, and often chemi-
cal, changes. In comparison with energy requirements
for processing other materials, those for polymers are
relatively low. Temperature control is vital because
it decides melt ﬂuidity. There is also a risk of ther-
mal degradation because, in addition to having limitedthermal stability, polymers have a low thermal con-
ductivity and readily overheat. Processing is usually
rapid, involvinghigh rates of shear. The main methods
that will be used to illustrate technological aspects of
processing thermoplastics are depicted in Figure 11.6.
Injection-moulding of thermoplastics, such as PE
and PS, is broadly similar in principle to the pressure
die-casting of light metals, being capable of produc-
ing mouldings of engineering components rapidly with
repeatable precision (Figure 11.6a). In each cycle, ametered amount (shot) of polymer melt is forcibly
injected by the reciprocating screw into a ‘cold’ cavity
(cooled by oil or water channels). When solidiﬁca-
tion is complete, the two-part mould opens and the
moulded shape is ejected. Cooling rates are fasterthan with parison moulds in blow-moulding because
heat is removed from two surfaces. The capital out-
lay for injection-moulding tends to be high because of
the high pressures involved and machining costs for
multi-impression moulding dies. In die design, specialattention is given to the location of weld lines, where
different ﬂows coalesce, and of feeding gates. Com-
puter modelling can be used to simulate the melt ﬂow
and distributions of temperature and pressure within
the mould cavity. This prior simulation helps to lessendependenceupontraditionalmouldingtrials,whichare
costly. Microprocessors are used to monitor and con-
trol pressure and feed rates continuously during the
moulding process; for example, the ﬂow rates into a
complex cavity can be rapid initially and then reducedto ensure that ﬂow-dividing obstructions do not pro-
duce weakening weld lines.
Extrusion is widely used to shape thermoplastics
into continuous lengths of sheet, tube, bar, ﬁlament,
etc. with a constant and exact cross-sectional proﬁle(Figure 11.6b). A long Archimedean screw (auger)
rotates and conveys feedstock through carefully pro-
portioned feed, compression and metering sections.
The polymer is electrically heated in each of the three
barrel sections and frictionally heated as it is ‘shear-thinned’ by the screw. Finally, it is forced through a
die oriﬁce. Microprocessor control systems are avail-
able to measure pressure at the die inlet and to keep
it constant by ‘trimming’ the rotational speed of the
screw. Dimensional control of the product beneﬁts

from this device. On leaving the die, the continuously-
formed extrudate enters cooling and haul-off sections.
Frequently, the extrudate provides the preform for a
second operation. For example, in a continuous melt-
inﬂation technique, tubular sheet of LDPE or HDPEfrom an annular die is drawn upwards and inﬂated
with air to form thin ﬁlm: stretching and thinning
cease when crystallization is complete at about 120 °C.
Similarly, in the blow-moulding of bottles and air-
ducting, etc., tubular extrudate (parison) moves ver-
tically downwards into an open split-mould. As themould closes, the parison is inﬂated with air at a pres-sure of about 5 atmospheres and assumes the shape of
the cooled mould surfaces. Relatively inexpensive alu-
minium moulds can be used because stresses are low.
Thermoforming (Figure 11.6c) is another secondary
method for processing extruded thermoplastic sheet,
being particularly suitable for large thin-walled hol-low shapes such as baths, boat hulls and car bodies
(e.g. ABS, PS, PVC, PMMA). In the basic version of
thethermoforming,aframe-heldsheetislocatedabovethe mould, heated by infrared radiation until rubberyand then drawn by vacuum into close contact with the
mould surface. The hot sheet is deformed and thinned
by biaxial stresses. In a high-pressure version of ther-moforming, air at a pressure of several atmospheres
acts on the opposite side of the sheet to the vacuum
and improves the ability of the sheet to register ﬁnemould detail. The draw ratio, which is the ratio ofmoulddepthtomouldwidth,isausefulcontrolparam-
eter. For a given polymer, it is possible to construct
a plot of draw ratio versus temperature which can beused as a ‘map’ to show various regions where there
are risks of incomplete corner ﬁlling, bursts and pin-
holes. Unfortunately, thinning is most pronounced atvulnerable corners. Thermoforming offers an econom-ical alternative to moulding but cycle times are rather
long and the ﬁnal shape needs trimming.
11.2.3 Production of thermosets
Development of methods for shaping thermosettingmaterials is restricted by the need to accommodate a
curing reaction and the absence of a stable viscoelas-tic state. Until fairly recently, these restrictions tendedto limit the size of thermoset products. Compres-
sion moulding of a thermosetting P-F resin ( Bakelite)
withinasimplecylindricalsteelmouldisawell-knownlaboratorymethodformountingmetallurgicalsamples.
Resin granules, sometimes mixed with hardening or
electrically-conducting additives, are loaded into themould, then heated and compressed until crosslinking
reactions are complete. In transfer moulding, which
can produce more intricate shapes, resin is melted ina primary chamber and then transferred to a ventedmoulding chamber for ﬁnal curing. In the car indus-
try, body panels with good bending stiffness are pro-
duced from thermosetting sheet-moulding compounds(SMC). A composite sheet is prepared by laying down
layers of randomly-oriented, chopped glass ﬁbres, cal-
cium carbonate powder and polyester resin. The sheetis placed in a mouldingpress and subjected to heat andpressure. Energy requirements are attractively low.
Greater exploitationof thermosets for large car parts
hasbeen made possiblebyreactioninjection-moulding
358Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
(RIM). In this process, polymerization takes place dur-
ing forming. Two or more streams of very ﬂuid chemi-
cal reactants are pumped at high velocity into a mixingchamber. The mixture bottom-feeds a closed chamberwhere polymerization is completed and a solid forms.
Mouldings intended for high-temperature service are
stabilized, or post-cured, by heating at a temperatureof100
°Cforabout30min.ThereactivesysteminRIM
can be polyurethyane-, nylon- or polyurea-forming.
The basic chemical criterion is that polymerization in
the mould should be virtually complete after about30 s. Foaming agents can be used to form compo-nentswitha dense skinanda cellular core. When glass
ﬁbres are added to one of the reactants, the process is
called reinforced reaction injection-moulding (RRIM).RIM now competes with the injection-moulding of
thermoplastics. Capital costs, energy requirements and
moulding pressures are lower and, unlike injection-mouldings, thick sections are not subject to shrinkageproblems (‘sinks’ and voids). Cycle times for RIM-
thermosets are becoming comparable with those for
injection-moulded thermoplastics and mouldings ofSMC. Stringent control is necessary during the RIMprocess. Temperature, composition and viscosity are
rapidlychangingintheﬂuidstream andthere isachal-
lenging need to develop appropriate dynamic modelsof mass transport and reaction kinetics.
11.2.4 Viscous aspects of melt behaviour
Melts of thermoplastic polymers behave in a highlyviscous manner when subjected to stress during pro-cessing. Flow through die oriﬁces and mould chan-nels is streamline (laminar), rather than turbulent,
with shear conditions usually predominating. Let us
now adopt a ﬂuid mechanics approach and considerthe effects of shear stress, temperature and hydro-static pressure on melt behaviour. Typical rates of
strain (shear rates) range from 10–10
3s/NUL1(extrusion)
to 103–105s/NUL1(injection-moulding). When a melt is
being forced through a die, the shear rate at the diewall is calculable as a function of the volumetric ﬂow
rate and the geometry of the oriﬁce. At the necessarily
high levels of stress required, the classic Newtonianrelation between shear stress and shear (strain) rateis not obeyed: an increase in shear stress produces
a disproportionately large increase in shear rate. In
other words, the shear stress/shear rate ratio, which isnow referred to as the ‘apparent shear viscosity’, falls.Termssuchas‘pseudo-plastic’and‘shear-thinning’are
applied to this non-Newtonian ﬂow behaviour.
1The
general working range of apparent shear viscosity for
extrusion, injection-moulding, etc. is 10–104Ns m/NUL2.
(Shear viscosities at low and high stress levels are
measured by cone-and-plate and capillary extrusion
techniques, respectively.)
1In thixotropic behaviour, viscosity decreases with increase
in theduration of shear (rather than the shear rate).Figure 11.7 shows the typical fall in apparent shear
viscosity which occurs as the shear stress is increased.
If Newtonian ﬂow prevailed, the plotted line wouldbe horizontal. This type of diagram is plotted forﬁxedvaluesoftemperatureandhydrostaticpressure.Achange in either of these two conditions will displacethe ﬂow curve signiﬁcantly. Thus, either raising thetemperature or decreasing the hydrostatic (bulk) pres-
sure will lower the apparent shear viscosity. The latter
increases with average molecular mass. For instance,ﬂuidity at a low stress, as determined by the standard
melt ﬂow index (MFI) test,
1is inversely proportional
to molecular mass. At low stress and for a givenmolecular mass, a polymer with a broad distributionofmolecular mass tends to become more pseudo-plasticthan one with a narrow distribution. However, at highstress, a reverse tendency is possible and the version
with a broader distribution may be less pseudo-plastic.
Figure 11.8 provides a comparison of the ﬂow
behaviour of ﬁve different thermoplastics and is usefulfor comparing the suitability of different processes. Itindicates that acrylics are relatively difﬁcult to extrude

during the development of PE, is used for most
thermoplastics by polymer manufacturers and processors.

and that PP is suited to the much faster deformation
process of injection-moulding. In all cases, Newtonian
ﬂow is evident at relatively low levels of shear stress.
The following type of power law equation has been
foundtoprovideareasonableﬁtwithpracticaldataandhas enabled pseudo-plastic behaviour to be quantiﬁed
in a convenient form:
/FSDC/CR
n⊿11.2/triangleleft
where Candnare constants. Now /FSD/DC1/CR, hence the
viscosity /DC1DC/CRn/NUL1. The characteristic term ⊿n/NUL1/triangleleft
can be derived from the line gradient of a graphical
plot of log viscosity versus log shear rate. In practice,the power law index nranges from unity (Newtonian
ﬂow)to <0.2,dependinguponthepolymer.Thisindex
decreases in magnitude as the shear rate increasesand the thermoplastic melt behaves in an increasingly
pseudo-plastic manner.
So far, attention has been concentrated on the vis-
cous aspects of melt behaviour during extrusion andinjection-moulding, with emphasis on shear processes.
In forming operations such as blow-moulding and
ﬁlament-drawing, extensional ﬂow predominates andtensile stresses become crucial; for these conditions,
it is appropriate to deﬁne tensile viscosity, the coun-
terpart of shear viscosity, as the ratio of tensile stressto tensile strain rate. At low stresses, tensile viscosity
is independent of tensile stress. As the level of tensile
stress rises, tensile viscosity either remains constant(nylon6,6), rises (LDPE) or falls (PP, HDPE). This
characteristic is relevant to the stability of dimensions
and form. For example, during blow-moulding, thin-
ningwallsshouldhaveatoleranceforlocalweakspotsor stress concentrations. PP and HDPE lack this tol-
erance and there is a risk that ‘tension-thinning’ will
lead to rupture. On the other hand, the tensile viscos-ity of LDPE rises with tensile stress and failure duringwall-thinning is less likely.
11.2.5 Elastic aspects of melt behaviour
While being deformed and forced through an extru-sion die, the melt stores elastic strain energy. Asextrudate emerges from the die, stresses are released,
some elastic recovery takes place and the extrudate
swells. Dimensionally, the degree of swell is typicallyexpressed by the ratio of extrudate diameter to diediameter; the elastic implications of the shear process
are expressed by the following modulus:
/SYND/FS//CR
R ⊿11.3/triangleleft
where /SYNis the elastic shear modulus, /FSis the shear
stressatdiewall,and /CRRistherecoverableshearstrain.
The magnitude of modulus /SYNdepends upon the poly-
mer, molecular mass distributionand the level of shearstress.(Unlikeviscosity,dependencyofelasticityupon
temperature, hydrostatic pressure and average molec-
ular mass is slight.) If the molecular mass distributionis wide, the elastic shear modulus is low and elastic
recoveryisappreciablebutslow.Foranarrowdistribu-
tion, with its greater similarities in molecular lengths,recovery is less but faster. With regard to stress level,the modulus remains constant at low shear stresses but
usually increases at the high stresses used commer-
cially, giving appreciable recovery.
The balance between elastic to viscous behaviour
during deformation can be gauged by comparing the
deformation time with the relaxation time or ‘natural
time’ ( /NAK) of the polymer. /NAKis the ratio of apparent
viscosity to elastic shear modulus ⊿/DC1//SYN/triangleleft, and derives
from theMaxwellmodelofdeformation.Thetermvis-
coelasticity originated from the development of such
models (e.g. Maxwell, Voigt, standard linear solid(SLS)). The Maxwell model is a mechanical analoguethat provides a useful, albeit imperfect, simulation of
viscoelasticity and stress relaxation in linear polymers
above T
g(Figure 11.9). It is based upon conditions
of constant strain. A viscously damped ‘Newtonian’
dashpot, representing the viscous component of defor-mation, and a spring, representing the elastic compo-
nent, are combined in series. At time t, the stress /ESCis
exponentiallyrelated to the initialstress /ESC

where /NAKis the relaxation time. When t×/NAK,t h e r e

molecules to take place and stress will fall rapidly.
When t−/NAK, elastic behaviour predominates. The
magnitude of /NAKranges from inﬁnity, at the start of
rubbery behaviour, to zero at the start of viscousbehaviour.A real polymer containsdifferent lengthsofmolecules and therefore features a spectrum of relax-ation times. Nevertheless, although best suited to poly-mersoflowmolecularmass,theMaxwellmodeloffers
a reasonable ﬁrst approximation for melts.
Let us now apply the relaxation time concept to
an injection-moulding process in which a thermo-plastic acrylic at a temperature of 230
°C is sheared
rapidly at a rate of 105s/NUL1. Assume that the injection
(deformation) time is 2 s. For the shear rate given,
Figure 11.8 indicates that the apparent shear viscosity
is 9 Ns m/NUL2and the corresponding maximum shear
stress is 0 .9M Nm/NUL2. At this shear stress, the elastic
shear modulus for acrylic is 0 .21 MN m/NUL2. The value
of/NAK⊿D/DC1//SYN/triangleleftis 43µs, which is very small compared
to the injection time of 2 s, hence viscous behaviourwill predominate. A similar procedure can be appliedto deformation by extrusion. For instance, PP with a
relaxation time of 0.5 s might pass though the extru-
sion die in 20 s. The time difference is smaller thanthepreviousexample of injection-moulding,indicatingthat although deformation is mainly viscous, elastic-ity will play a greater part than in injection-moulding.The previously-mentioned phenomenon of die swellthen becomes understandable. (Swelling is equivalent
to the spring action in the Maxwell model.) Although
the degree of elastic behaviour may be relativelysmall during injection-moulding and extrusion, it can,nevertheless, sometimes cause serious ﬂow defects.
Relaxation times for extensional ﬂow, as employed
in blow-moulding, can be derived from the ratio of
apparent tensile viscosity to elastic tensile modulus
⊿ED/ESC/ε
R/triangleleft. Suppose that a PP parison at a temper-
ature of 230 °C hangs for 5 s before inﬂation with
air. If the tensile viscosity and tensile modulus are36 kN s m/NUL2and 4 .6k Nm/NUL2, respectively, the relax-
ation time is roughly 8 s. Hence sagging of the parisonunder its own weight will be predominantly elastic.
11.2.6 Flow defects
The complex nature of possible ﬂow defects under-lines the need for careful product design (sections,shapes, tools) and close control of raw materials andoperational variables (temperatures, shear rates, cool-
ing arrangements). The quality of processing makes a
vital contribution to the engineering performance of apolymer.
Ideally, melt ﬂow should be streamlined throughout
the shaping process. If the entry angle of an extru-sion die causes an abrupt change in ﬂow direction, themelt assumes a natural angle as it converges upon thedie entry and a relatively stagnant ‘dead zone’ is cre-ated at the back of the die. In this region, the meltwill have a different thermal history. In addition to itsdominant shear component, the convergent ﬂow con-
tains an extensional component that increases rapidly
during convergence. If the extensional stress reaches acritical value, localized ‘melt fracture’ will occur at afrequency depending upon conditions. The fragmentsproduced recover some of the extensional strain. Theeffect upon the emerging extrudate can range from amatt ﬁnish to gross helical distortions. The associatedﬂow condition is often termed ‘non-laminar’ despitethe fact that the calculated value of the dimensionlessReynolds number is very low. The choice of entryangle for the die is crucial and depends partly upon
the polymer.
As a melt passes through the die, velocity gradients
develop, with the melt near the die surface movingslower than the central melt. Upon leaving the die,the outer layers of extrudate accelerate, eliminating thevelocity gradient. Above a critical velocity, the resul-tant stresses rupture the surface to give a ‘sharkskin’effect which can range in severity from a matt ﬁnishto regular ridging perpendicular to the extrusion direc-tion. ‘Sharkskin’ is most likely when the polymer has
a high average molecular mass (i.e. highly viscous)
and a narrow molecular mass distribution (i.e. highlyelastic); these factors cause surface stress to build uprapidly and to relax slowly. Fast extrusion at a lowtemperature favours this defect. Heating of the tip ofthe die lowers viscosity and reduces its likelihood.
Aninhomogeneousmeltwillproduceanon-uniform
recovery of elastic strain at the cooling surface andinﬂuence its ﬁnal texture. Thorough mixing beforeshaping is essential. However, inhomogeneity mayexist on a molecular scale. For instance, in both
injection-moulding and extrusion, a broad distribution
of molecular mass gives a more matt ﬁnish than a nar-row distribution. Thus, extrusion of a polymer witha narrow mass distribution at a rate slow enough toprevent the development of ‘sharkskin’ will favour ahigh-gloss ﬁnish.
Plastics and composites 361
Volatile constituents tend to vaporize, or ‘boil off’,
from the melt if processing temperatures are high. Forinstance, water vapour may derive from hygroscopic
raw materials. Sometimes, a polymer degrades and
releases a volatile monomer. Hydrostatic pressure usu-
ally keeps the volatiles in solution; as the hot polymer
leaves the die, this pressure is released and the escap-ing volatiles form internal bubbles and may pit the
surface.
When a polymer is heated to the processing temper-
ature, the weak intermolecular forces are readily over-
come by thermal vibrations. Its density may decrease
by as much as 25%. The subsequent cooling can
produce shrinkage defects, particularly in crystallinepolymers, which assume more closely packed con-
formations than amorphous polymers, and in thick
sections. Polymers have a low thermal conductivity
and the hot core can contract to produce depressions
or ‘sink marks’ in the surface. If the surface layer
cools rapidly, its rigidity can encourage internal voids
to form. Careful product design can minimize shrink-age problems. Cooling under pressure after injection-
moulding is beneﬁcial.
Orientation effects, which are common in shaped
polymers, have a special signiﬁcance when the poly-
mer is ‘reinforced’ with short lengths of glass ﬁbre. (Ithas been estimated that roughly half of the engineer-
ing thermoplastics are ﬁbre-ﬁlled.) In extruded pipes,
ﬁbres will tend to be aligned parallel to the extrusion
direction and improve longitudinal strength. However,
this orientation weakens the pipe transversely and the
burst strength will suffer. In addition, the tubular form
necessitates use of a ‘spider’ to support a central die,or mandrel, which causes the melt to split and coa-
lesce before entering the die. The resultant weld lines
introduce weakening interfaces. A die system is now
available in which one or both dies are rotated. Their
shearing action has the beneﬁcial effect of incliningﬁbres at an angle to the extrusion direction. Weld lines
are also reoriented so that they are placed in shear
rather than tension when in service.
11.3 Fibre-reinforced composite
materials
11.3.1 Introduction to basic structural
principles
11.3.1.1 The functions of ﬁlaments and matrix
In engineering practice, where considerations of mec-
hanical strength and stiffness are usually paramount,
the term ‘composite’ is generally understood to referto a material which combines a matrix phase with
admixed ﬁlaments of a reinforcing (strengthening)
phase. Acompositederivesfrom theessentiallysimple
and practical idea of bonding together two or more
homogeneous materials which have very different
properties. Thus, in the glass-reinforced polymer
(GRP) known generally as Fibreglass , large numbersof short, strong and stiff ﬁbres of glass are randomly
dispersed in a weaker but tougher matrix of thermosetresin. In general, the diameter of reinforcing ﬁlamentsfor composites is in the order of 10 /SYNm. They may be
continuous, extending the full length of a component,
or short (discontinuous) and may share a common
orientation, be randomly oriented or even woven intocloth. There is a statistical distribution of strengthvalues among ﬁlaments made from brittle materialssuch as glass, boron and carbon.
The term ‘composite’ is sometimes taken to include
materials in which the second phase is in the form
of particles or laminae. In such cases the compositestructure may offer special advantages, other thanstrength, such as economy and corrosion-resistance(e.g. ﬁller in plastics, plastic-coated steel sheet). The
recorded history of technology contains numerous
accounts of innovative, often remarkable, ideas forcomposites.
1The present account primarily concerns
the reinforcement of polymeric, metallic and ceramicmatrices with ﬁbres and ‘whisker’ crystals. Finally, on
an even ﬁner scale, we will consider application of
the composite principle to microstructural constituents(i.e. nanocomposites). Relatively simple mechanicalmodels will be used because they provide sufﬁcientintroduction to the ground rules of composite design
and behaviour.
Althoughﬁbresareastrikingfeatureofacomposite,
it is initially helpful to examine the functions of thematrix. Ideally, it should be able to (1) inﬁltrate theﬁbres and solidify rapidly at a reasonable temperatureand pressure, (2) form a coherent bond, usually
chemical in nature, at all matrix/ﬁbre interfaces,
(3) envelop the ﬁbres, which are usually very notch-sensitive, protecting them from mutual damage byabrasion and from the environment (chemical attack,moisture), (4) transfer working stresses to the ﬁbres,
(5) separate ﬁbres so that failure of individual ﬁbres
remains localized and does not jeopardize the integrityof the whole component, (6) debond from individualﬁbres, with absorption of signiﬁcant amounts ofstrain energy, whenever a propagating crack in the
matrix chances to impinge upon them, and (7) remain
physically and chemically stable after manufacture.
11.3.1.2 Continuous-ﬁbre composites
In mechanical terms, the prime function of the matrixis to transfer stresses to the ﬁbres (item (4) above)because these are stronger and of higher elasticmodulus than the matrix. The response of a compositetoappliedstressdependsupontherespectiveproperties
of the ﬁbre and matrix phases, their relative volume
fractions, ﬁbre length and the orientation of ﬁbresrelative to the direction of applied stress.
1During the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II, Geoffrey
Pyke proposed the construction of ocean-going aircraft
carriers from paper pulp/frozen sea water ( Pykecrete ). In
1985, ice/wood ﬁbres ( Icecrete) was proposed for wharf and
off-shore oil platform construction in Norwegian waters.

Some basic principles of the elastic response to
stress can be obtained from mechanical models inwhich continuous ﬁbres are set unidirectionally in
an isotropic, void-free matrix (Figures 11.10a and
11.10b). It will be assumed that the Poisson ratiofor the ﬁbre material is similar to that of the matrix.Using subscript letters c, f, m, l and t we can signifywhere property values refer respectively to composite,ﬁbre, matrix, longitudinal and transverse directions.

Figure 11.11 illustrates this relation, showing that
as the modulus ratio and/or the volume fraction ofﬁbres increase, more and more stress is transferred to
the ﬁbres. If the modulus ratio is unity, the composite
must contain at least 50% v/v ﬁbres if the ﬁbres areto carry the same load as the matrix. Three typicalcomposites A, B and C with 50% v/v reinforcementare superimposed on the graph to show the extent towhich two increases in modulus ratio raise the stress

This ‘series’ version of the Rule assumes a condition
of isostress and is derived by adding strains: it is lessaccurate than the ‘parallel’ version. Both versions canbe used to calculate shear moduli and conductivities(thermal, electrical). More reﬁned mathematical
treatments are available: they are particularly helpful
for transverse properties. Sometimes ﬁbre propertiesare highly anisotropic and this feature inﬂuences thecorresponding value for the composite; for instance,E

so that the equations for the ‘parallel’ and ‘series’
models express, in mathematical form, the dominanteffect of ﬁbres on longitudinal properties and the
dominant effect of the matrix on transverse properties.
If typical tensile stress versus strain curves for ﬁbre
and matrix materials (Figure 11.12a) are compared,
it can be seen that the critical strain, beyond which
the composite loses its effectiveness, is determined bythe strain at fracture of the ﬁbres, ε

In general, a low Vcritis sought in order to minimize

approximately by the numerator of the above ratio.Thus, a matrix with a strong tendency to strain-hardenwillrequire a relatively large volume fraction of ﬁbres,

11.3.1.3 Short-ﬁbre composites
So far, attention has been focused on the behaviour
of continuous ﬁbres under stress. Fabrication ofthese composites by processes such as ﬁlament-winding is exacting and costly. On the other hand,
composites made from short (discontinuous) ﬁbres
enable designers to use cheaper, faster and moreversatile methods (e.g. injection-moulding, transfer-
moulding). Furthermore, some reinforcements are only
available as short ﬁbres. At this point, it is appropriateto consider an isolated short ﬁbre under axial tensile
stress and to introduce the idea of an aspect ratio
⊿length/diameter Dl/d/triangleleft. It is usually in the order of
10 to 10
3for short ﬁbres: many types of ﬁbre and
whisker crystal with aspect ratios greater than 500 areavailable. For a given diameter of ﬁbre, an increase
in length will increase the extent of bonding at the
ﬁbre/matrix interface and favour the desired transferof working stresses. As will be shown, it is necessary
for the length of short ﬁbres to exceed a certain criticallength
1if efﬁcient transfer of stress is to take place.
Withrespecttodiameter,ﬁbrestrengthincreasesasthediameter of a brittle ﬁbre is reduced. This effect occursbecause a smaller surface area makes it less likely thatweakening ﬂaws will be present.
For the model, in which a matrix containing a short
ﬁbre is subjected to a tensile stress (Figure 11.13a),it is assumed that the strain to failure of the matrixis greater than the strain to failure of the ﬁbre. Thedifferences in displacement between matrix and ﬁbrethus cause shear stress, /FS, to develop at the cylindrical
interfaces toward each ﬁbre end. A corresponding
tensile stress, /ESC, builds up within the ﬁbre. At each
end of the ﬁbre, these stresses change over a distanceknown as the stress transfer length (l/2);t h a ti s ,
the tensile stress increases as the interfacial shear
stress decreases. In Figure 11.13a, for simplicity, we
assume that the gradient of tensile stress is linear. Ifthe length of the ﬁbre is increased, the peak tensilestress coincides with fracture stress for the ﬁlament(Figure 11.13b). The total length of ﬁbre now has a
critical value of l
cand the transfer length becomes
lc/2. If the length is sub-critical, ﬁbre failure cannot
occur. At the critical condition, the average tensilestress on the ﬁbre is only /ESC
f/2. With any further
increase in ﬁbre length,a plateau developsin the stress
proﬁle (Figure 11.13c). The average tensile stress
on the ﬁbre, which is stated beneath Figure 11.13c,approaches the fracture strength /ESC
fas the ﬁbre length
increases beyond its critical value. In effect, the load-carrying efﬁciency of the ﬁbre is approaching that of
its direct-loaded continuous counterpart. Provided that
the shear stresses do not cause ‘pull-out’ of the ﬁbre,fracture will eventually occur in the mid-region ofthe ﬁbre.
The condition of critical ﬁbre length can be
quantiﬁed. Suppose that an increment of tensile force,
υ/ESC, is applied to an element of ﬁbre, υl. The balance
1A. Kelly introduced the concept of ‘critical ﬁbre length’.

between tensile force and interfacial shear force is:
υ/ESC⊿/EMd2/4/triangleleftD/FS⊿/EMd.υl/triangleleft ⊿ 11.10/triangleleft
Hence the gradient υ/ESC/υlfor the build-up of
tensile stress is 4 /FS/d. For the critical condition
(Figure 11.13b), the gradient is /ESCfdivided by the
critical transfer length lc/2. The critical length lcis
therefore /ESCfd/2/FS. Expressed in terms of the critical
aspect ratio, the criterion for efﬁcient stress transfer
takes the form:
lc/d½/ESCf/2/FS⊿ 11.11/triangleleft
Thisrelationprovidesan insightintothe capabilities
of short-ﬁbre composites. For instance, for a given
diameter of ﬁbre, if the interfacial shear strength ofthe ﬁbres is lowered, then longer ﬁbres are needed
in order to grip the matrix and receive stress. When
the operating temperature is raised and the shearstrength decreases faster than the fracture strength
of the ﬁbres, the critical aspect ratio increases. The
presence of tensile and shear terms in the relationhighlights the indirect nature of short-ﬁbre loading:
matrix strength and interfacial shear strength are
much more crucial factors than in continuous-ﬁbrecomposites where loading is direct. Interfacial shear
strength depends upon the quality of bonding and
can have an important effect upon the overall impactresistance of the composite. Ideally, the bond strengthshouldbe such that it can absorb energy by debonding,
thus helping to inhibit crack propagation. Interfacial
adhesion is particularly good in glass ﬁbre/polyesterresin and carbon ﬁbre/epoxy resin systems. Coupling
agents are used to promote chemical bonding at the
interfaces. For example, glass ﬁbres are coated withsilane (size) which reacts with the enveloping resin.
Sometimes these treatments also improve resistance to
aqueousenvironments.However,ifinterfacialbondingis extremely strong, there is an attendant risk that animpinging crack will pass into and through ﬁbres with
little hindrance.
Provided that V
f>Vcrit, the tensile strength at
fracture of a short-ﬁbre reinforced composite can be
calculatedfromthepreviousRuleofMixturesequation
by substituting the mean tensile stress term for the
fracture stress, as follows:
/ESCcD/ESC⊿1/NULlc/2l/triangleleftVfC/ESC0
mVm ⊿11.12/triangleleft
It isassumed that the shear strength /FSremains constant
and that ﬁbres are perfectly aligned. First, the equation
shows that short ﬁbres strengthen less than continuous
ones. For example, if all ﬁbres are ten times the
critical length, they carry 95% of the stress carried by
continuous ﬁbres. On the other hand, if their lengthfalls below the critical value, the strength suffers
seriously. For instance, if the working load on the
composite should cause some of the weaker ﬁbres
to fail, so that the load is then carried by a larger
number of ﬁbres, the effective aspect ratio and thestrength of the composite tend to fall. The same type
of equation can also be applied to the elastic modulus
of a short-ﬁbre composite; again the value will be less
than that obtainable with its continuous counterpart.
Theequationalsoshowsthatmatrixpropertiesbecomemore prominent as ﬁbres are shortened.
11.3.1.4 Effect of ﬁbre orientation on strength
Let us reconsider composites in which continuousﬁbres are aligned in the same direction as thedirection of applied stress. The strength of this highly
anisotropic type of composite varies with the volume
fraction of ﬁbres in a linear manner, as shown in
Figure 11.12b. If the ﬁbres are now oriented at an
angle /RSto the direction of applied tensile stress, the
general effect is to reduce the gradient of the strength
curve for values of V
fgreater than Vmin, as shown in
Figure 11.14. This weakening effect is represented by

As/RSincreases from zero, /DC1falls below unity.
In order to provide a more detailed analysis of the
variation of composite strength with ﬁbre orientation,
it is customary to apply a ‘maximum stress’ theorybased on the premise that there are three possible
modes of composite failure. Apart from the angle of
ﬁbre orientation /RS, three properties of the composite
are invoked: the strength parallel to the ﬁbres /ESC
ﬂ,t h e
shear strength of the matrix parallel to the ﬁbres /FSm,
and the strength normal to the ﬁbres /ESCft. Each mode
of failure is represented by an equation which relatesthe composite strength /ESC
clto a resolved stress.
For the ﬁrst mode of failure, which is controlled by
tensile fracture of the ﬁbres, the equation is
/ESCclD/ESCﬂsec2/RS⊿ 11.14/triangleleft
The equation for failure controlled by shear on a plane
parallel to the ﬁbres is:
/ESCclD2/FSmcosec2 /RS⊿ 11.15/triangleleft
As the temperature is raised, this mode of failure
becomes more likely in off-axis composites because
the shear strength /FSmfalls more rapidly than /ESCﬂ.
In the third mode of failure, transverse rupture
occurs, either in the matrix or at the ﬁbre/matrix
interface (debonding). The relevant equation is:
/ESCclD/ESCftcosec2/RS⊿ 11.16/triangleleft
Figure 11.15 shows the characteristic form of the
relation between composite strength and ﬁbre orienta-tion. While illustratingthe highly anisotropic character
of the unidirectional continuous reinforcement, it also
shows the merit of achieving low values of /RS.P r e d i c -
tions, using the maximum stress theory, and experi-mental results are in good agreement and conﬁrm the
general validity of this curve. (Measured values of /ESC

mode of failure is decided by the equation which gives
the lowestvalue of compositestrength /ESCcl. Thus, trans-
verse rupture becomes dominant when /RSis large. At
relatively low values of /RS, there is a rapid fall in com-
posite strength which is associated with the transition
fromtensilefailureinﬁbrestofailurebyshear.Combi-
nation of the ﬁrst two of the three equations eliminates/ESC
cland gives the critical angle for this transition:
/RScritDtan/NUL1⊿/FSm//ESCﬂ/triangleleft⊿ 11.17/triangleleft
If the longitudinal strength is about ten times the shear
strength of the matrix, then the angle is about 6 °.
When an application involves applied stresses
that are not conﬁned to one direction, the problem
of anisotropy can often be effectively solved orminimized by using continuous ﬁbres in the form of
woven cloth or laminates. Although these forms are
more isotropic than unidirectional composites, there isinevitably a slight but usually tolerable loss in strength
and stiffness. Glass, carbon and aramid ﬁbres are used;

truly three-dimensional reinforcement, with improvedthrough-thickness properties, can be obtained by
placingwovenclothsontopofeachotherandstitching
them together with continuous ﬁbre.
Laminates based on carbon and aramid ﬁbres are
commonly used for high-performance applications
that involve complex stress systems (e.g. twisting,bending). The unit of construction is a thin ply
of unidirectional composite, 50–130
µm thick. Plies
are carefully stacked and oriented with respect toorthogonal reference axes (0
°and 90 °). The simplest
lay-up sequence is (0/90/90/0). Other more isotropic
sequences are ⊿0/C45//NUL45//NUL45/C45/0/triangleleftand
366Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
⊿0/C60//NUL60//NUL60/C60/0/triangleleft. The stacking of plies
is symmetrical about the mid-plane of the laminate in
order to prevent distortion and to ensure a uniform
response to working stresses.
Randomly-oriented short ﬁbres of glass are com-
monly used in sheets and in three-dimensional mould-
ings. In fact, ﬁbre misorientation is quite common in
composites, frequently being an unavoidable result of
fabrication.Forinstance,whenresinsloadedwithshort
ﬁbres are injection-moulded, the mixture follows com-
plex ﬂow paths. If the ﬁnished moulding is sectioned,
ﬁbres will clearly indicate the patterns of ﬂow: these
patterns are determined by melt viscosity, mould con-
tours and processing conditions. Fortunately, ﬂow pat-
terns are repeatable from moulding to moulding. Close
to the surface of the moulding, the short ﬁbres tend to
followstreamlinepaths;inthecentralcore, whereﬂow
ismore turbulent,ﬁbresarelikelytoassumetransverse
orientations.
11.3.2 Types of ﬁbre-reinforced composite
11.3.2.1 Polymer-matrix composites
Glass-reinforced polymers (GRP) date from the
early 1940s1and were the forerunners of present-
day polymer-, metal- and ceramic-matrix com-
posites. A typical fabrication procedure for a
GRP is to add a mixture of polyester resin,
curing agent and catalyst to ﬁbres of low-
alkali E-glass (typically 53SiO 2–18CaO–14Al 2O3–
10B2O3–5MgO).Thethermosettingreactionsofcuring
are then allowed to take place at a temperature below
150°C. The relatively low cost, stiffness and ease of
fabrication of GRP led to their widespread adoption in
engineering,evenforlargestructures(e.g.storagetanks
and silos, mine counter-measure vessels).
Glass ﬁbres for composites are made by allow-
ing molten glass to pass through the nozzles of an
electrically heated bushing made from Pt-10Rh alloy.
(The number of nozzle holes in the base of the bush-
ing is 204, or a multiple of 204.) The ﬁlaments
emerge at a velocity of 50–100 m s/NUL1and are rapidly
cooled with a water mist to prevent crystallization,
hauled over a ‘size’ applicator and ﬁnally collected
by a rotating cylinder (collet). ‘Sizing’ applies a coat-
ing which loosely bonds the ﬁbres, protects their
fragile glass surfaces from damage and introduces a
surface-modifying ‘coupling’ agent to promote even-
tual ﬁbre/matrix bonding. The primary bundle of con-
tinuous, untwisted ﬁbres is the unit of collection from
the bushing and is known as a strand. That is, it con-
tains 204, 408, 816 or more ﬁbres. (The equivalent
unit for carbon ﬁbres is called a tow.) Strands can be
combined to form a larger bundle (roving). Strands or
rovings are used for unidirectional composites and as
yarn for weaving; alternatively, they can be chopped

domly in a plane. (e.g. chopped strand mat for press
moulding). Interstage ‘sizing’ is often practised. The
range of ﬁbre diameters is 5–20 µm. Although origi-
nally developed for electrical applications, E-glass isthe principal material for the production of continuous
glass ﬁbres. Other compositions are available, giving a
highermodulusofelasticity(H-modulusglass),greater
tensile strength (S-glass), or better alkali resistance
(AR-glass), etc.
The principal methods for fabricating polymer-
matrix composites are (1) hand lay-up or spray-up,
(2) press-mouldingwithheatedmatchingdies,(3) vac-
uum moulding, (4) autoclave moulding, (5) resin
transfer moulding, (6) reinforced reaction injectionmoulding (RRIM), (7) pultrusion, and (8) ﬁlament
winding. Broadly, these listed methods either bring
ﬁbres and ‘wet’ resin together during processing or
use pre-impregnated shapes (pre-pregs) in which ﬁbres
and thermoset resin are pre-combined. Pre-pregs aremade by inﬁltrating rovings, mats or woven fabrics
with resin and then heating in order to initiate partial
curing. This B-stage of polymerization is preserved
until processing by storing at a low temperature. Pre-
pregs facilitate control of inﬁltration, orientation andﬁbre content, making it possible to produce polymer-
matrix composite (PMC) of repeatable quality on an
automated mass-production basis. In each of the above
methods there isneed toprevent air or vapoursbecom-
ing trapped in the composite and forming weakeningvoids. Voids form preferentially at ﬁbre/matrix inter-
faces and between the plies of layered composites.
Low-viscosity resins, outgassing and high pressures
are some of the means used to minimise this porosity.
Polyester-based matrices remain the principal
choice for polymer-matrix composites. In the 1970s,
polyesters became available in the form of moulding
compounds that are particularly suitable for hot press-
moulding. Dough moulding compounds (DMC) and
sheet moulding compounds (SMC) contain roughlyequal volume fractions of polyester resin, inert ﬁller
particles and chopped glass ﬁbres. When heated,
these compounds rapidly become ﬂuid, reproduce the
contours and details of the moulding dies accurately
and then cure. This technique is used for domesticarticles, panels and doors of vehicles, cabinets for
ofﬁce and electronic equipment, etc.
As part of the search for cheaper fabrication meth-
ods, much effort has been devoted to the develop-
ment of PMCs with thermoplastic matrices (e.g. nylon
66, PP, PTFE, PET, polyether sulphone (PES), etc).
For example, water boxes of car radiators and shell
housings for street lamps have been made from a
composite of 33% glass ﬁbres in a nylon 66 matrix
(Maranyl). In the early 1980s, pre-pregs made of
polyether ether ketone (PEEK) reinforced with PAN-
derived carbon ﬁbres ( APC2) became available: how-
ever, they are costly and use tends to be restricted
to highly-specialized applications (e.g. aircraft com-
ponents). The general advantages of a thermoplastic
Plastics and composites 367
matrix are its toughness, indeﬁnite shelf life and, in
the absence of curing, a shorter time cycle for fab-rication. However, during the necessary heating, theviscosity of the matrix is higher than that of a ther-
moset resin, making inﬁltration between ﬁbres more
difﬁcult. Furthermore, the pre-pregs are stiff and lackthe drapability of thermoset pre-pregs which enablesthem to bend easily into shape.
For the exacting requirements of aerospace and
high-performance aircraft, the principal PMCs haveepoxide matrices reinforced with continuous ﬁbres of
carbon or aramids ( Kevlar). The basic advantage of
epoxides is that they can be used at higher servicetemperatures than polyester matrices. Although theT
gvalue of a polymer provides an indication of its
temperature ceiling, it is substantially higher than the
maximum temperature for safe service under load.
For instance, the maximum temperature for a load-bearing epoxide matrix is about 160
°C, whereas the
corresponding Tgvalues lie in the range 200–240 °C
(depending upon the method of determination). The
search for matrices with a higher temperature capabil-ity has led to the development of bismaleimides (BMI)and polyimides (PI). These and other new polymers
raised the ceiling temperature closer to 200
°C but have
sometimes introduced a brittleness problem and theycan be difﬁcult to process.
Carbon ﬁbre reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are
ﬁrmly established as construction materials forspecializedanddemandingapplications(e.g.helicopterrotors, monocoque chassis of racing cars, aircraft ﬂoor
panels, spacecraft components, sports goods, high-
speed loom components). Laminates of continuouscarbon ﬁbres ( Graﬁl) are widely used. Carbon ﬁbres
are also used in metal-matrix and ceramic-matrix
composites. Frequently, they are combined with other
types of ﬁbre to form hybrid composites (e.g. glassand carbon, aramid ( Kevlar) and carbon). Carbon
ﬁbres, 5–10
µm diameter, are available in untwisted
tows containing 1000, 3000, 6000, 12000 or 120000ﬁlaments and as pre-pregs with resin. In the UK andthe USA they are mostly produced from the textile
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and its copolymers. Many
types of PAN-derived carbon ﬁbre are produced (e.g.commodity, high-modulus, high-extension, etc.).
The three-stage process
1for manufacturing carbon
ﬁbre is based on the controlled degradation or pyrol-
ysis of spun ﬁbres of PAN. Hot-stretching is a centralfeatureofprocessing:itcounteractsthetendencyofthe
ﬁbres to shrinkand induces a high degree of molecular
orientation. The tow is ﬁrst oxidized under tension at atemperature of 200
°C and forms a stable, crosslinked
‘ladder’ structure. In the second stage, heating in an
inert atmosphere at temperatures between 800 °Ca n d
1600°C carbonizes the structure, releasing vapours and
gases (hydrogen, nitrogen) and reducing the originalmass by 40–50%. Finally, the oriented carbon ﬁbres

(RAE), Farnborough, in the 1960s over a ﬁve-year period.form graphite crystallitesduring heat-treatment at tem-
peratures in the range 1300 °C to more than 2000 °C.
Raising this treatment temperature encourages graphi-
tization and improves the elastic modulus but lowers
the strain to failure. Finally, the ﬁbres are surface-
treated (e.g. electrolytic oxidation) to improve subse-
quent bonding to the matrix and ‘sized’ to facilitate
handling.
Each carbon ﬁbre produced is very pure and con-
sists essentially of interwoven ‘ribbons’ of turbostratic
graphite (Figure 11.16a) and some amorphous carbon.
Theribbonsare alignedparalleltotheﬁbre axis. Being
animperfect structure,theamountofporosityisappre-
ciable. In general terms, a-axes of the planar crystal-
lites are parallel to the ﬁbre axis, the other a-axis is
radial or circumferential, and the c-axes are perpendic-
ular to the ﬁbre axis. As the structure becomes more
truly graphitic, the ribbon orientation approaches that
of the ﬁbre axis and the axial modulus increases. The
ﬁbre structureishighlyanisotropic:themoduliofelas-
ticity along the ﬁbres and perpendicular to the ﬁbres
are 200–800 GN m/NUL2and 10–20GNm/NUL2, respec-
tively. (The modulusfor E-glass is about 73 GN m/NUL2.)
Another textile, rayon, is used as a precursor for
carbon ﬁbres, but to a lesser extent than PAN. Alter-
natively, melt-spun ﬁlaments of high-purity, meso-
phase pitch can be oxidized and pyrolized in a process
broadly similar to the PAN process to yield car-
bon ﬁbres with a very high modulus approaching
1000 GN m/NUL2.Pitch-derivedcarbonﬁbreisexpensive,
more difﬁcult to handle than PAN-derived ﬁbres and
its use is conﬁned to specialized applications.
Aramid ﬁbres ( Kevlar 29 and49, Twaron ) based
on aromatic polyamides are important reinforcements
for polymers. Their linear molecular structure
(Figure 11.16b) is produced from spun ﬁbre by aprocess of drawing and heating under tension at
a temperature of approximately 550
°C. This linear
structure, which contrasts with the more planar
structureofcarbonﬁbres, givesaramidﬁbres aﬁbrillar
character and they can absorb considerable amounts
of impact energy. When struck with a projectile,
aramid ﬁbres split into numerous microﬁbrils, givingexceptional ‘stopping power’. This property has
led to the use of aramid ﬁbres and aramid/resin
laminates for ballistic applications (e.g. armour).
The elastic modulus is 50–130 GN m
/NUL2and it is
stable at temperatures approaching 400 °C (depending
upon the environment). Their mechanical properties
are degraded by ultraviolet radiation; nevertheless,
aramid ﬁbres are widely used, particularly in hybrid
composites.
The rapid deceleration of racing cars and landing
aircraft develops very high frictional forces and tem-
peratures in braking systems: this challenge has been
met by composites in which a carbonaceous matrix is
reinforced with carbon ﬁbres. These carbon–carbon
composites combine the refractory potential of car-
bon with the high speciﬁc strength/stiffness of car-
bon ﬁbres. PAN or pitch are used as precursors when

high-modulus ﬁbres are required. Chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) can be used to produce the matrix
phase:hydrocarbongasinﬁltratesthecarbonﬁbres andis thermally ‘cracked’ to form a matrix of pyrolyticgraphite. C–C composites maintain their strength at
high temperatures and have high thermal conductiv-
ityand excellent friction/wear characteristics. They areused for aircraft and racing car brakes, rocket noz-
zles and the heat shield of the Space Shuttle. In the
presence of oxygen, C–C composites begin to oxi-dize and sublime at relatively low temperatures, say400
°C. Efforts are being made to develop long-life
multilayer coatings for this type of composite that will
inhibit oxygen diffusion, ‘self-heal’ and enable servicetemperatures in oxidising environments to be raised to1400–1500
°C.11.3.2.2 Metal-matrix composites
Large-scale research and development studies of
metal-matrix composites (MMCs) date back to the
1960s, being stimulated at that time by the new
availability of carbon and boron ﬁbres, whiskercrystals and, more indirectly, by successes achievedwithreinforcedpolymer–matrixcomposites.Theaero-space and defence industries were attracted by the
prospects of a new type of constructional material
possessing high speciﬁc strength/stiffness. The fallin strength produced by rising temperature is moregradual in MMCs than with unreinforced matrixmaterial, promising higher service temperatures. Inaddition, the MMC concept offers prospects of unique
wear resistance and thermal expansion characteristics.
Plastics and composites 369
For example, parts of space structures are required
to maintain dimensional stability while being cycled
through an extremely wide range of temperature.
One criterion of performance is called the thermal
deformation resistance, which is the ratio of thermalconductivity to the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion.
The expansion coefﬁcient of graphite ﬁbres with a
very high elastic modulus is negative, which makes
it feasible to design continuous-ﬁbre MMCs with a
zero coefﬁcient of thermal expansion.
Typical early versions of MMC were boron ﬁbres
in titanium and carbon ﬁbres in nickel. Over the
years, interest has ranged from continuous and dis-
continuous ﬁbres to whisker crystals and particles.
The nominal ranges of diameter for continuous ﬁbres,short ﬁbres and whiskers, and particles are 3–140
µm,
0–20µm and 0.5–100 µm. Continuous unidirectional
ﬁbre-reinforcement gives the greatest improvement in
properties over those of unreinforced matrix material.
Interest in whisker reinforcement, once very great,has tended to decline because of the carcinogenic
risks associated with handling small whiskers during
manufacture and composite fabrication. At present,
particle-reinforced MMCs ﬁnd the largest industrial
application, being essentially isotropic and easier toprocess. Matrices based upon low-density elements
have gradually come into prominence. The principal
matrix materials are aluminium and its alloys, titanium
and its alloys, and magnesium. Most MMCs are based
on aluminium and its alloys. In recent years, cheaperparticles and ﬁbres of silicon carbide have become
available, making them the commonest choice of rein-
forcement material. Alumina ( Safﬁl) reinforcement is
also used in many MMCs.
Figure 11.17 illustrates the considerable improve-
ments in speciﬁc tensile strength (longitudinal) and
speciﬁcmodulusthatresultwhenaluminiumalloysare
reinforced with ﬁbres, whiskers or particles. Property
changes of this magnitude are unlikely to be achieved
by more orthodox routes of alloy development. Atthe same time, as the diagram shows, these changes
are accompanied by rising costs and bring anisotropy
into prominence. The ratio of longitudinal strength to
transverse strength can be 15:1 or more for MMCs.
Although continuous-ﬁbre reinforcement can confermaximum unidirectional strength, service conditions
frequently involve multi-axial stresses.
A wide and growing variety of methods is avail-
able for producing MMCs, either as components or as
feedstock for further processing (e.g. billets for extru-sion, rolling, forging). Many of these methods are still

Powder blending techniques (1) are favoured, rather
than melting, when the metallic matrix has a highmeltingpoint,thusminimizingtheﬁbre/matrixinterac-tion problem. After the critical blending operation, theMMCpowderiscanned,vacuumdegassedandconsol-idated by hot-pressing or HIPing. Finally, the MMC isworked and shaped (e.g. extrusion, forging). Particlevolume fractions of 0.25–0.50 are typical. Mechan-ical alloying is broadly similar to powder blending;the essential difference is that alloying of pure metalpowders is achieved in high-speed ball mills. In the
melt-stirring technique (3), the presence of particles
raises the melt viscosity.

injected into this stream. Fine-grained MMC deposits
of SiC/aluminiumalloy and Al 2O3/steel can be builtas
plate, tube, billets for hot-working, cladding, etc. Thepathogenic risks associated with certain types of ﬁneparticles, ﬁbres and whiskers have necessarily beentaken into consideration.Filaments of 0.1–3
µmd i a m -
eter and with lengths greater than 5 µm are hazardous.
Accordingly,SiCparticlesizesexceedacertainthresh-old (e.g. 5
µm).
The fabrication of continuous-ﬁbre reinforced
MMCs is difﬁcult and technically demanding. Fibrepreforms with a high volume fraction of ﬁbres aredifﬁcult to ‘wet’ and inﬁltrate; on the other hand, ifV
fis low, the preform will lack the ‘green’ strength
required for handling. A high melt temperature will
lower viscosity and assist inﬁltration of the ﬁbresbut increases the risk of ﬁbre/metal reactions. (SiC,Al
2O3and carbon ﬁbres react with aluminium alloy
matrices at a temperature of 500 °C.) There is also a
risk that secondary working operations will damagethe ﬁbres. In general, the methods for continuousﬁbres are costly, give low production rates and limitthe size and shape of the MMC product. Typicalmethods for producing continuous-ﬁbre MMCs are(1) diffusion bonding (DB), (2) squeeze-casting, and(3) liquid pressure forming (LPF).
Diffusion bonding (1) can be used to consolidate
metal with continuous ﬁbres of SiC, Al
2O3, boron and
carbon. Fibres are pre-coated with matrix material or
carbon. The process conditionsmust achieve a delicate
balance between promotionofsolid-statediffusionandlimitation of ﬁbre/matrix reactions. DB has been usedtoproduceboron/aluminiumstrutsfortheNASAspaceshuttle and SiC/titanium alloy composites.
In principle, squeeze-casting (2) is a single-shot
process combining gravity die-casting with closed-die forging. It is mainly used for discontinuous-ﬁbreMMCs. A metered charge of melt containing shortﬁbres is fed into the lowermost of a pair of diesand then compressed at high pressure (35–70 MN
m
/NUL2) by the descending upper die. The pressure is
maintainedwhilethechargesolidiﬁes.Interpretationof
the relevant phase diagram for the matrix has to allowfor the pressure variable. Boundaries in the diagramare shifted and, for alloys that contract on freezing,the liquidus temperature is raised. With aluminiumalloys, this shift is about 10–25
°C. Thus, the applied
pressure has an undercooling effect which, togetherwith the loss of heat through the dies, favours rapidsolidiﬁcation. The high pressure also discourages thenucleation of gas bubbles. The ﬁnal matrix structureis accordingly ﬁne-grained and dense. Moderate-sizedcomponents can be produced at high rates.
In liquid pressure forming (3), a preheated ﬁbre
preform is placed within split dies. The dies are closed
and air pressure in the cavity reduced below 1 mb.
Molten aluminium casting alloy under pressure is theninﬁltrated upwards through the preform and allowed
to solidify. LPF uses a lower pressure ( <8M Nm
/NUL2)
than squeeze-casting and there is less limitation onsize and shape of product. Particle-reinforced MMCs
can be produced. Using a single preform and one

With regard to applications, the emphasis in the
aerospace industry is the development of MMCs based
upontitaniumorintermetalliccompoundssuchasTiAland Ti
3Al. For example, coated SiC ﬁbres are used
to reinforce Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Proposed applications
for MMCs include compressor discs and blades in
aero-engines, engine pylons and stabilizers. Channel
extrusions made from discontinuous-ﬁbre reinforcedMMC are in use for electrical racking in aircraft.
In general manufacturing, there is interest in using
SiCﬁbre-reinforcedaluminiumforcriticalcomponentsoperating at very high speeds where high speciﬁc
stiffness would be mechanically advantageous (e.g.
carpet-making, food packaging, textile production).
Co-sprayed steel matrix deposits have been used for
components of plant handling highly-abrasive materi-als (e.g. coke, minerals, wood, ﬁbreboard).
In the car industry MMCs are now accepted as
candidate materials for valve rocker arms, connect-ing rods, gear selector forks, pulleys, propshafts, etc.
They have also made it possible to replace cast
iron engine cylinder blocks with selectively-reinforced
blocks of aluminium alloy ( Honda). The hybrid com-
posite, which contains 12% v/v alumina particles (forstrength)and9%v/vcarbonﬁbres(forlubricity),saves
weight, improves the power rating and dispenses with
cast iron cylinder liners.
In diesel engines
2the achievement of higher
combustion efﬁciencies, with better fuel economy and
reduction in the exhaust emissions of undesirable
gases and particulate matter, has resulted in highertemperatures and peak pressures in the combustion
chambers. The standard alloy for diesel pistons is
Al–12Si–1Cu–1Mg (LM 13 in BS1490: Lo-Ex).
Although this eutectic alloy is satisfactory for a
working temperature range of 250–300
°C, advances
in engineering design have raised crown temperatures
to 300–350 °C. For instance, in one relatively new
design feature, now established for direct-injectionengines, a deep combustion bowl is located in the
crown of each piston. This turbulence-inducing cavity
usually has re-entrant angles and sharp edges. Thehigher mechanical and thermal loading on the bowl lip
can cause cracking. This problem has been solved by
squeeze-casting the piston body and, at the same time,
incorporating a ﬁbre-reinforced bowl. A controlled
quantity of aluminium alloy melt is fed into anopen die, which contains a preformed compact of
alumina ﬁbres, and then compressed with a pressure
of 120–150 MN m
/NUL2by a hydraulically-actuated plug
die, so that the ﬁbres are inﬁltrated, ‘wetted’ and

design, with local reinforcement of the combustion
bowl and the top ring groove. Accepted practice for
thelargepistonsofheavy-dutyandturbochargeddiesel
engines is to reinforce this groove, and possibly thesecond groove, with a wear-resistant insert of nickel-
rich, and hence austenitic, cast iron ( Ni-Resist)w h i c h
is bonded to the aluminium alloy body by the Alﬁn
process. In small high-speed indirect-injection diesel
engines,whichhaveapre-combustionchamber,lighter
and cheaper MMC inserts have been used successfully
to reinforce the groove. The performance of this insert
is crucial because modern designsare tendingto locatethe top groove much closer to the crown, even in the
‘headland’ position, thus reducing the volume of the
annular ‘dead space’ above the ring and giving fuel
economy and reduced emissions.
When considered in terms of the costly effort that
has been put into development of MMCs, commercial
exploitation has been disappointingly limited. MMC
structures and components face strong competitionfrom alternative, more conventional engineering mate-
rials. Exploitation has been mainly hindered by the
high cost of reinforcement materials, particularly con-
tinuous ﬁbres, and fundamental features of MMC

Group).structures that tend to make fabrication difﬁcult and
service performance questionable.
During fabrication, formation of the matrix often
necessitates a high processing temperature (e.g. meltinﬁltration). This temperature can be high enough to
promote unwanted chemical reactions at the interfaces
between matrix and reinforcement. These conditionsmay arise during service at elevated temperatures, ofcourse. SiC-reinforced titanium is an example of a
composite in which brittle interfacial products tend to
form (i.e. silicides and carbides). Ideally, the aim isto develop a strong interfacial bond without degradingtheﬁbreorformingweakeningphasesattheinterfaces.
The coating of ﬁbres is generally regarded as the most
promising means to control chemical interaction atreinforcement/matrix surfaces. However, it is difﬁcultto develop a coating with long-term stability.
As might be anticipated, the deliberate introduction
ofshortstress-concentratingﬁbresintoametaloralloytends to reduce the ductility and toughness below thatof the unreinforced matrix. When a short-ﬁbre MMC
is deformed by applied stress, the amount of strain in
ﬁbre and matrix may differ substantially, leading torupture of the interfacial bonding at the end regionsof ﬁbres. This debonding results in the nucleation and
rapid growth of voids. Void formation is the dominant
mode of tensile failure in SiC/aluminium composites.Adifferenceinthecoefﬁcientsofthermalexpansionofﬁbre and matrix can produce the same effect, possibly
during the cooling stages of composite fabrication or
duringthermalexcursionsandcyclinginservice.Thus,because ˛
f<˛m, ﬁbres and particles develop residual
compressive stress and the matrix is left in a state
of tension. This disparity in expansion characteristics
between the reinforcement phase and the matrix alsohelps to generate a high density of dislocations inthe matrix. Plastic deformation of the matrix involves
dislocation movement across slip planes. If a slip
plane is threaded by ﬁbres, a glissile dislocation willbow between them and recombine beyond the ﬁbres,leavinganOrowanlooparoundeachﬁbre.Theseloops
reduce the effective gap between ﬁbres and successive
dislocations are forced to assume smaller radii ofcurvature as they bypass the ﬁbres. In combinationwith a high dislocation density and a ﬁne matrix grain
size, this mechanism can produce a high rate of initial
strain-hardening in the matrix.
The presence of extremely hard reinforcement par-
ticles or ﬁbres can beneﬁt wear-resistance in service
but leads to difﬁculties during the ﬁnish-machiningoperations that are usually needed for MMC products.These particles act as chip-breakers during machin-
ing of materials, such as SiC-reinforced aluminium
alloys, and reduce cutting forces: unfortunately, theyalso shorten tool life signiﬁcantly, even when tools aretipped with polycrystalline diamond (PCD). Machin-
ing tends to generate sub-surface damage, a matter of
special concern in the preparation of mechanical test-pieces.
372Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Despite these formidable problems, the basic idea
of reinforcing a strong deformable matrix with elasticﬁbres retains its appeal to the aerospace, defence and
automotive industries and active research on MMCs
continues worldwide. There is a need to expand and
consolidate the database for properties of MMCs (e.g.
fracture toughness, fatigue resistance, corrosion resis-
tance, etc.).

11.3.2.3 Ceramic-matrix composites
Reinforcement of cements and concretes with short ﬁl-
aments of glass, steel or carbon is applied in the build-
ing and construction industries. Costs are very closely
scrutinized in these industries and the increase in costassociated with ﬁbre reinforcement is often regarded
as unacceptable unless there is promise of exceptional
properties. In one example, a 2% v/v dispersion of
steel wires (low-carbon or austenitic stainless) in a
concrete matrix ( Wirand Concrete
2) confers improved
resistance to crack propagation and greater ﬂexural
and compressive strength. These wires are typically
0.25–0.5 µm diameter, with an aspect ratio of 100:1.
The resistance of this composite to salt water and topebble abrasion have led to its use for 40 t twin-ﬂuked
shapes(dolosse)forshoredefences againstheavyseas.
Since the 1980s there has been a sustained inter-
est in the development of ceramic-matrix compos-
ites (CMCs) for high-temperature applications that
demand exceptional strength and chemical stability
(e.g. advancedenginedesigns,cuttingtools).Ceramics
ingeneralareinherentlynotch-sensitiveandbrittle:the
introduction of ﬁbres is primarily intended to improvethe toughness of the matrix and reliability in service.
(In polymer-matrix and metal-matrix composites, rein-
forcement is used to improve strength, stiffness and,
if possible, toughness.) Currently, the principal matri-
ces are inorganic glasses and glass-ceramics but it
is also possible to use engineering ceramics, such as
alumina and silicon nitride. Reinforcement materials,
which include silicon carbide ( Nicalon, Tyranno ), alu-
mina and carbon, have taken the form of continuousﬁbres, short ﬁbres, whisker crystals, woven ﬁbre cloth
and laminates.
Failure in CMC structures is complex in character
and a variety of mechanisms has been identiﬁed. It is
not possible to apply directly the theory of fracture
mechanics that was developed for monolithic ceramic
bodies. Researches on CMC systems using continuous
ﬁbres primarily aim to achieve substantial improve-
ments in toughness and reliability. To this end, there
is particular interest in structures that have a capac-
ity for accumulating damage and that eventually fail

materials by the US government: samples and detailedinformation are consequently unavailable.

in a gradual (‘graceful’) manner, rather than suddenly
and catastrophically. This overload capability is illus-trated schematically in Figure 11.19, which gives thetensile stress versus strain curve for a unidirectional
composite. It will be noted that the fracture strain
of the unreinforced matrix is considerably less thanthat of the composite. Superimposed on the curve
for the composite are the principal micromechanisms
of failure, namely (1) microcracking of the matrix,(2) interfacial failure as ﬁbre pull-out takes place and(3) ﬁbre fracture.
In general terms, events taking place in the wake of
each crack tip become more signiﬁcant than ﬂaws inthe matrix. Thus, unbroken ﬁbres bridge the cracks in
the matrix, oppose opening separation of these cracks
andreduce theeffective stressintensityfactoratthetipof the crack. As the matrix cracks, load is increasinglytransferred to the ﬁbres. A high E
f/Emratio and a high
content of ﬁbres favour this transfer. Volume fractions
up to 0.5–0.6 are quoted in reports.
Debonding at the ﬁbre/matrix interfaces is clearly
an important aspect of the overall fracture process.
Strong bonding assists the transfer of load from matrixto ﬁbres and increases the amount of energy absorbedduring ﬁbre pull-out. However, if this bond strength
is exceptionally strong, cracks may travel in an unhin-
dered, brittle manner through matrix and ﬁbres alike,with the CMC behaving like a monolithic ceramic. On
theotherhand,ifbondingisrelativelyweak,thecourse
of an incident crack may be deﬂected into the interfa-cial zone, with useful absorption of energy. For these
reasons, special attention is given to ways of control-
ling and/or modifying the surface character of ﬁbres.
The degree to which the linear coefﬁcients of ther-
mal expansion ⊿˛/triangleleftof ﬁbre and matrix materials match
is an important aspect of CMC design. For instance,
a mismatch between ˛-values can favour the type of
Plastics and composites 373
crack-deﬂection process just described. Again, if short
ﬁbres are used and there is a substantial mismatch in
˛-values, cracks will tend to be initiated at the ends of
the ﬁbres. Thermal cycling will aggravate this type ofdamage. A mismatch in the expansion characterisics
of well-bonded ﬁbres and matrix can also introduce a
‘pre-stressing’ effect that inhibits crack growth. Thus,if˛
f>˛m, then cooling from a high temperature will
induce residual tensile stress in the ﬁbres and residual
compressive stress in the matrix. This imbalance has
a toughening effect because microcracks advancing inthe matrix have to overcome compressive stress.
Scanning electron microscopy provides valuable
information on deformation and failure mechanisms
in CMC structures. A sample of composite can beimagedin situwith high resolution while being sub-
jected to tensile, bending, compressive or cyclic stress.
Figure 11.20a shows a SiC ﬁbre in a matrix of cal-
cium aluminosilicate during an early stage of fatiguefailure, with the ﬁbre bridging the microcrack in thematrix. Eventually, as Figure 11.20b shows, the ﬁbre
itself fractures after a certain amount of pull-out from
the matrix.
Fabrication of CMCs is expensive, demanding very
close control. During fabrication of a continuous ﬁbre
CMC, it is necessary to inﬁltrate the ﬁbres, which may
be in the form of woven cloth, with a ﬂuid form of thematrix-building material. The most common methoduses a slurry of ceramic particles, a carrier liquid
(water or alcohol), an organic binder and, sometimes,
a surface-wetting agent. After drying, the shape is hot-pressed. A range of alternative production routes isnow available (e.g. sol–gel reaction, melt inﬁltration,
chemical vapour deposition (CVD), reaction-sintering,
transfer-moulding). Unique fabrication problems canarise. For instance, during high-temperature ﬁring,chemical reaction at the ﬁbre/matrix interfaces may
cause weakening intermediate phases to form. With
regard to industrial utilization, there is still a widely-accepted need to improve toughness and reliabilityfurther. Although some CMCs can be used in air
at temperatures approaching 1000
°C, oxidation is a
potential problem when carbon and SiC ﬁbres areused; ﬁbre oxidation may occur at temperatures aslow as 350–400
°C. Coatings have proved effective in
preventingthiswastingattackandinraisingtheceiling
temperature for the composite. Alternatively, an inertgaseous environment may be used but is obviously not
always feasible. Glassy matrices are favoured because
processing is generally simpler; unfortunately, it ispossible for certain glasses to begin to soften in thetemperature range 500–800
°C.
As the foregoing remarks indicate, a number of
problems are associated with the production and uti-lization of ceramic-matrix composites. Commercialexploitation of CMCs to date has consequently been
rather restricted. Combinations that have found appli-
cationsinengineeringare SiCwhiskers/polycrystallinealumina (cutting-tool tips), graphite ﬁbres/borosilicate

Alloymicrostructures,suchaseutecticsandeutectoids,
containing a dispersion of ﬁbres or lamellae within a
374Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
matrix phase are well-known products of phase trans-
formation. They form an intimate combination of two
or more quite different phases and, understandably,
there has been strong interest in developing in-situ
(self-assembled) composites which offer the advan-tages of the orthodox composites produced by addinga matrix phase to preformed ﬁbres. This new class
of materials, with its micron-scale structures, offersthe prospect of unique physical (electrical, thermal,magnetic), mechanical and chemical properties. Pro-vided that the alloy system is carefully chosen andmanipulated, it is possible to produce unidirection-ally solidi ﬁed structures with a uniform distribution
of aligned ﬁbres over extended distances. The prob-
lem ofﬁbre/matrix interaction so often associated with
conventional fabrication routes is eliminated. Eutecticsystems are immediately attractive because the solidphases produced simultaneously by this type of reac-tion are essentially in thermodynamic equilibrium andare held together by strong interfacial bonds. Fibres
are preferred to lamellae because the latter are more
likely to be weakened by the presence of transversecracks.
In-situcomposites are commonly produced by the
classical laboratory technique in which molten alloy iswithdrawn vertically downwards from a furnace heldat a constant temperature. The rate of withdrawal is
necessarily very low for some alloys ⊿<10 mm h
/NUL1/triangleleft,
increasing the risk that the materials of containmentwill contaminate the melt. Because of the low produc-tionrates,coststendtobehigh.Astheeutecticreactionproceeds, solid phases nucleate and grow perpendicu-
lar tothe horizontalmelt/eutecticinterface inacooper-
ative manner. Interdiffusion of alloying elements takesplace in the melt adjacent to this advancing interface.If both matrix and reinforcement phases have a lowentropy of fusion, the eutectic structure grows in auniform manner and the interface is essentially planar.Fortunately, most alloy systems of industrial interesttend to freeze with this morphology when solidi ﬁ-
cation is closely controlled, even in cases where thereinforcing phase (e.g. carbide) has a known tendencyto form crystallographically oriented facets because ofits high entropy of fusion. When both phases have ahigh entropy of fusion, each phase has a strong ten-dency to form facets and the ﬁnal structure is likely
to be very irregular with much branching. This lastcombination is intrinsically unsuitable for producingin-situcomposites.
Severe limitations on phase composition and phase
ratio may apply to these melt-grown composites. For
instance, binary alloy systems can often only developa relatively small volume fraction of a strong ﬁbrous
phase. In the Ni –Al system, which has been exten-
sively studied, the volume fraction of strong Al
3Ni
ﬁlaments within the aluminium-based matrix is 0.1.
(Beyond a certain volume fraction in a given system,laminae have a lower interfacial energy and tend toform in preference to ﬁbres.) Complex ternary alloy
systems are more promising: a monovariant eutecticreaction at a ‘valley’line in the liquidus surface of the
Co–Cr–C system can produce 30% v/v carbide ﬁbres
in a solid solution matrix of cobalt and chromium.
For high-temperature applications, such as turbine
blades inaero engines, in-situcomposites can compete
withdirectionally-solidi ﬁed(DS)nickel-basedsuperal-
loys and single-crystal superalloys (e.g. stress-rupture
properties in directions parallel to the reinforcement).
Aligned two-phase structures can be grown from the
alloy melt; phase compositions can be varied quite
widely without preventing such structures from form-ing. There is also valuable scope for alloying additions
(Cr, Al, W, Re) which enhance properties such as
resistance to oxidation, corrosion, creep and thermal
fatigue. Examples are the NITAC and COTAC series
of eutectic superalloys, which are based upon nickel
and cobalt, respectively. In typical NITAC alloy, the
ductile matrix consists of /CR-Ni and a ﬁne precipitate of
Ni
3Al particles (gamma-prime phase, /CR0), and is rein-
forced with a carbide phase (e.g. TaC, Cr 3C2,N b C ) .
In service, the integrity of in-situcomposites can be
jeopardized by oxidative attack, temperature gradients
and/orthermalcycling.Thelastconditionispotentially
disruptive because a mismatch in the thermal expan-
sion characteristics of the two phases will cause stiff
ﬁbres to fracture and the ductile matrix phase to fail
by fatigue.
In the late 1980s, researchers began to extend the
composite principle beyond the micron scale and intothe nanometre range (1 –50 nm). The ‘jumps’in vari-
ous properties achieved with these new nanocomposite
microstructures were considerable. An early prototype
was a nominally single-phase ceramic structure based
upon a conventional polycrystalline matrix of micron-
sized alumina grains. A uniform dispersion of 5% sili-
concarbideinclusions,about10 nminsize,throughout
this matrix gives a fourfold increase in strength. The
processing route for this ceramic is based upon estab-lished sintering technology: the main stages are the

ders, hot-pressing ⊿1750°C/triangleleftand annealing ⊿1300°C/triangleleft.
The structural character of the ceramic is shownschematically in Figure 11.21. It has been proposedthat the large number of dislocations present form asub-structure within each grain, with SiC particles atthe nodal points. In general terms, this combination ofmicron-sized grains and much ﬁner nanometre-scale
sub-structures gives exceptional strength and, impor-tantly in the case of ceramics, good reproducibility.
Study of nanoscale structures has been extended to
a wide variety of metallic systems. Again, fabricationis based on pure, ultra ﬁne powders. These powders
are mainly produced by either condensation from a
vapour, which minimizes the risk of contamination, or
high-energy ball-milling. Two or more metal powders

are stable and highly resistant to grain growth. The
grains are randomly-oriented and fairly uniform insize (say, 5 –10 nm). Contiguous grains can differ in
chemical composition.

unusual properties and behaviour that are not explica-bleintermsofconventionalscienti ﬁctheory.Thuscur-
rent explanations of dislocation behaviour, diffusion,solid solubility and fracture in nanoscale structures areoften tentative.

proceeds in the presence of water, can also destroy
metallic surfaces and is responsible for a wide varietyof difﬁcult problems throughout all branches of indus-try. The principles and some examples of ‘dry’ and‘wet’ corrosion will be discussed in Section 12.2.
Conventionally, the surface properties of steels are
improved by machining to produce a smooth sur-face texture (superﬁnishing), mechanically working(shot-peening), introducing small atoms of carbonand/or nitrogen by thermochemical means (carbur-
izing, nitriding, carbo-nitriding), applying protective
coatings (galvanizing, electroplating), chemically con-verting (anodizing), etc. Many of these traditionalmethods employ a liquid phase (melt, electrolyte). Incontrast, many of the latest generation of advanced
methods for either coating or modifying material sur-
faces use vapours or high-energy beams of atoms/ionsas the active media. Their successful application on acommercialscalehasrevealedthemeritsofdevelopinganewphilosophyofsurfacedesignandengineering.InSection 12.3, we examine some typical modern meth-
ods for improving surface behaviour.
12.2 Metallic corrosion
12.2.1 Oxidation at high temperatures
12.2.1.1 Thermodynamics of oxidation
The tendency for a metal to oxidize, like any other
spontaneous reaction, is indicated by the free energy
change Gaccompanying the formation of the oxide.
Most metals readily oxidize because Gis negative
for oxide formation. The free energy released by thecombinationofaﬁxedamount(1 mol)oftheoxidizing
agent with the metal is given by G
°and is usually
termed the standard free energy of the reaction. G°
is, of course, related to H°, the standard heat of
reaction and S°the standard change in entropy, by
the Gibbs equation. The variation of the standard freeenergy change with absolute temperature for a numberof metal oxides is shown in Figure 12.1. The noble
metals which are easily reduced occur at the top of the
diagram and the more reactive metals at the bottom.Some of these metals at the bottom (Al, Ti, Zr),
however, resist oxidation at room temperature owing
to the impermeability of the thin coherent oxide ﬁlmwhich ﬁrst forms.
The numerical value of G
°for oxidation reactions
decreases with increase in temperature, i.e. the oxidesbecome less stable. This arises from the decreasedentropy accompanying the reaction, solid (metal) C
gas (oxygen) !solid (oxide). The metal and oxide,

theGversus Tlines therefore slope upwards at
about this value, and any change in slope is due to
a change in state. As expected, melting has a smalleffect on Sand hence G, but transitions through
the boiling point (e.g. ZnO at 970
°C) and sublimation

(e.g. Li 2O at 1330 °C) have large effects. Exceptions
to the positive slope of the Gversus Tline occur
for carbon oxidation to CO or CO 2. In both cases the
oxide product is gaseous and thus also has a high freeenergy. In the reaction 2C CO
2!2CO, two moles
of gas are produced from one of oxygen so that
SD⊿Soxide/NULScarbon/NULSoxygen/triangleleft

The CO free energy versus temperature line has a
downward slope of approximately this value. For the
CCO2!CO2reaction,onemoleofCO 2isproducedfrom one mole of oxygen and hence S'0; the CO 2
free energy line is thus almost horizontal. The carbon
monoxide reaction is favoured at high temperatures
and consequently carbon is a very effective reducing
agent, having a greater afﬁnity for oxygen than most
oxides.
Because of the positive slope to the G°versus T
line for most oxides in Figure 12.1, G°tends to
zero at some elevated temperature. This is known
as the standard dissociation temperature when the
oxide is in equilibrium with the pure element and
oxygen at 1 atm pressure. In the case of gold, the
oxide is not stable at room temperature, for silver
378Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Ag2O dissociates when gently heated to about 200 °C,
and the oxides of the Pt group of metals around
1000°C. The other oxides dissociate at much higher
temperatures. However, the temperature is affectedby pressure since the free energy per mole of anygaseous phase varies with pressure P(atm) according
toG⊿P/triangleleftDG

phase is relatively unaffected. Thus, for the metal C

this value the oxide will dissociate, if raised above, theoxide is stable. The common metal oxides have very
low dissociation pressures ³10

at ordinary annealing temperatures and thus readilyoxidize in the absence of reducing atmospheres.
The standard free energy change G

to the equilibrium constant Kof the reaction. For the
reaction discussed above, i.e.

12.2.1.2 Kinetics of oxidation
Free energy changes indicate the probable stable reac-
tion product but make no prediction of the rate atwhich this product is formed. During oxidation the
ﬁrst oxygen molecules to be absorbed on the metal
surface dissociate into their component atoms before
bonding chemically to the surface atoms of the metal.
This process, involving dissociation and ionization, isknown as chemisorption. After the build-up of a few
adsorbed layers the oxide is nucleated epitaxially on
the grains of the base metal at favourable sites, such as
dislocationsandimpurityatoms.Eachnucleatedregion
grows, impinging on one another until the oxide ﬁlmforms over the whole surface. Oxides are therefore
usually composed of an aggregate of individual grains
or crystals, and exhibit phenomena such as recrystal-lization, grain growth, creep involving lattice defects,
just as in a metal.
If the oxide ﬁlm initially produced is porous the
oxygen is able to pass through and continue to react
at the oxide–metal interface. Usually, however, theﬁlm is not porous and continued oxidation involves
diffusion through the oxide layer. If oxidation takes
place at the oxygen–oxide surface, then metal ions
and electrons have to diffuse through from the under-
lying metal. When the oxidation reaction occurs at
Corrosion and surface engineering 379
the metal–oxide interface, oxygen ions have to dif-
fuse through the oxide and electrons migrate in the
opposite direction to complete the reaction.
The growth of the oxide ﬁlm may be followed by
means of a thermobalance in conjunction with met-allographic techniques. With the thermobalance it is
possible to measure to a sensitivity of 10
/NUL7gi na n
accurately controlledatmosphere andtemperature. Themost common metallographic technique is ellipsom-
etry, which depends on the change in the plane of
polarization of a beam of polarized light on reﬂectionfrom an oxide surface; the angle of rotation dependson the thickness of the oxide. Interferometry is alsoused, but more use is being made of replicas and thin
ﬁlms in the transmission electron microscope and the
scanning electron microscope.
The rate at which the oxide ﬁlm thickens depends
on the temperature and the material, as shown inFigure 12.2. During the initial stages of growth at low
temperatures, because the oxygen atoms acquire elec-
trons from the surface metal atoms, a strong electricﬁeld is set up across the thin oxide ﬁlm pulling themetal atomsthroughtheoxide.In thislow-temperaturerange (e.g. Fe below 200
°C) the thickness increases
logarithmically with time ⊿x/lnt/triangleleft, the rate of oxida-
tion falling off as the ﬁeld strength diminishes.
At intermediate temperatures (e.g. 250–1000 °Ci n
Fe) the oxidation develops with time according to a
parabolic law ⊿x2/t/triangleleftin nearly all metals. In this
region the growth is a thermally-activated process andions pass through the oxide ﬁlm by thermal move-ment, their speed of migration depending on the nature
of the defect structure of the oxide lattice. Large
stresses, either compressive or tensile, may often buildup in oxide ﬁlms and lead to breakaway effects whenthe protective oxide ﬁlm cracks and spalls. Repeatedbreakaway on a ﬁne scale can prevent the develop-
ment of extensive parabolic growth and the oxida-
tion assumes an approximately linear rate or evenfaster. The stresses in oxide ﬁlm are related to thePilling–Bedworth (P–B) ratio, deﬁned as the ratioof the molecular volume of the oxide to the atomicvolume of the metal from which the oxide is formed.
Figure 12.2 Different forms of oxidation behaviour in
metals.If the ratio is less than unity as for Mg, Na, K, the
oxide formed may be unable to give adequate pro-tection against further oxidation right from the initialstages and under these conditions, commonly foundin alkali metals, linear oxidation ⊿x/t/triangleleftis obeyed.
If, however, the P–B ratio is very much greater than
unity, as for many of the transition metals, the oxideis too bulky and may also tend to spall.
At high temperatures oxide ﬁlms thicken according
to the parabolic rate law, x
2/tand the mechanism
by which thickening proceeds has been explained byWagner. Point defects (see Chapter 4) diffuse throughthe oxide under the inﬂuence of a constant concen-tration gradient. The defects are annihilated at one of
the interfaces causing a new lattice site to be formed.
Speciﬁcally, zinc oxide thickens by the diffusion ofzinc interstitials created at the metal/oxide interfacethrough the oxide to the oxide/oxygen interface where
they are removed by the reaction

parameters. Wagner has shown that the oxidation pro-cess can be equated to an ionic plus an electroniccurrent, and obtained a rate equation for oxidation in
chemical equivalents cm
/NUL2s/NUL1involving the transport
numbers of anionsand electrons, respectively, the con-ductivity of the oxide, the chemical potentials of thediffusing ions at the interfaces and the thickness ofthe oxide ﬁlm. Many oxides thicken according to a
parabolic law over some particular temperature range.
It is a thermally-activated process and the rate constantkDk
0ðexp[/NULQ/RT] with Qequal to the activation
energy for the rate-controlling diffusion process.
At low temperatures and for thin oxide ﬁlms, a
logarithmic rate law is observed. To account for thisthe Wagner mechanism was modiﬁed by Cabrera
380Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
and Mott. The Wagner mechanism is only applicable
when the concentrations of point defects and electronsare equal throughout the ﬁlm; for thin oxide ﬁlms
this is not so, a charged layer is established at the
oxide/oxygen interface. Here the oxygen atoms on theouter surface become negative ions by extracting elec-
trons from the metal underneath the ﬁlm and so exert
an electrostatic attraction on the positive ions in themetal. When the oxide thickness is
/H1138910 nm this layer
results in an extremely large electric ﬁeld being set
up which pulls the diffusing ions through the ﬁlm andaccelerates the oxidation process. As the ﬁlm thickens
the ﬁeld strength decreases as the distance between
positive and negative ions increases and the oxida-tion rate approximates to that predicted by the Wagner
theory.
As the scale thickens, according to a parabolic law,
the resultant stress at the interface increases and even-
tuallytheoxidelayercanfaileitherbyfracture parallel
totheinterface orbya shear ortensilefracture throughthe layer. In these regions the oxidation rate is then
increased until the build-up in stress is again relieved
by local fracture of the oxide scale. Unless the scale
fractureprocessoccursatthesametimeoverthewhole
surface of the specimen then the repeated parabolicnature of the oxidation rate will be smoothed out and
an approximately linear law observed. This break-
away parabolic law is sometimes called paralinear,and is common in oxidation of titanium when the
oxidereachesacriticalthickness.Insomemetals,how-
ever, such as U, W and Ce, the linear rate process isassociated with an interface reaction converting a thin
protective inner oxide layer to a non-protective porous
oxide.
12.2.1.3 Parameters affecting oxidation rates
The Wagner theory of oxidation and its dependence
on the nature of the defect structure has been suc-
cessful in explaining the behaviour of oxides undervarious conditions, notably the effects of small alloy-
ing additions and oxygen pressure variations. The
observed effects can be explained by reference totypical n-a n d p-type semiconducting oxides. For
oxidation of Zn to ZnO the zinc atoms enter the
oxide interstitially at the oxide/metal interface ⊿Zn!

The oxide/oxygen interface reaction ⊿2Zn iCCC4eC
O2!2ZnO /triangleleftis assumed to a rapid (equilibrium) pro-
cess and consequently, the concentration of defects at
this interface is very small, and independent of oxygen
pressure. This is found to be the case experimentallyfor oxide thicknesses in the Wagner region. By con-
sidering the oxide as a semiconductor with a relatively
small defect concentration, the law of mass action canbe applied to the defect species. For the oxide/oxygen
interface reaction this means that
[Zn
CC]2[e]4Dconstant
The effect of small alloyingadditionscan be explained
(Wagner–Hauffe rule) by considering this equation.Suppose an alloying element is added to the metal
that enters the oxide on the cation lattice. Since there
are associated with each cation site only two electronsites available in the valence band of the oxide, if theelement is trivalent the excess electrons enter the con-
ductionband,increasingtheconcentrationofelectrons.
For a dilute solution the equilibrium constant remainsunaffected and hence, from the above equation, the neteffect of adding the element will be to decrease the
concentration of zinc interstitials and thus the rate of
oxidation. Conversely, addition of a monovalent ele-ment will increase the oxidation rate. Experimentallyit is found that Al decreases and Li increases the oxi-
dation rate.
ForCu
2O,ap-typesemiconductor,theoxideforma-
tion and cation vacancy ⊿CuC/square/triangleleftcreation take place at
the oxide/oxygen interface, according to
O2C4CuD2Cu2OC4⊿CuC/square/triangleleftC4⊿e/square/triangleleft
The defect diffuses across the oxide and is eliminated
at the oxide-metal interface; the equilibrium concen-tration of defects is at the metal–oxide interface andthe excess at the oxide–oxygen interface. It follows
therefore that the reaction rate is pressure-dependent.
Applying the law of mass action to the oxidation reac-tion gives
[Cu
C/square]4[e/square]4Dconst PO2
and, since electrical neutrality requires [CuC/square]D
[e/square], then
[CuC/square]Dconst P1/8
O2⊿12.7/triangleleft
and the reaction rate should be proportional to the
1/8th power of the oxygen pressure. In practice, it
varies as P1/7
O2, and the discrepancy is thought to be
due to the defect concentration not being sufﬁciently
low to neglect any interaction effects. The addition of
lower valency cations (e.g. transition metals) wouldcontribute fewer electrons and thereby increase theconcentrationofholes,decreasingthevacancyconcen-
tration and hence the rate. Conversely, higher valency
cations increase the rate of oxidation.
12.2.1.4 Oxidation resistance
The addition of alloying elements according to theWagner–Hauffe rule just considered is one way in
which the oxidation rate may be changed to give
increased oxidation resistance. The alloying elementmay be added, however, because it is a strong oxide-former and forms its own oxide on the metal surface
in preference to that of the solvent metal. Chromium,
for example, is an excellent additive,forming a protec-tive Cr
2O3layer on a number of metals (e.g. Fe, Ni)
but is detrimental to Ti which forms an n-type anion-
defective oxide. Aluminium additions to copper simi-
larly improve the oxidation behaviour by preferentialoxidation to Al
2O3. In some cases, the oxide formed
Corrosion and surface engineering 381
is a compound oxide of both the solute and solvent
metals. The best-known examples are the spinels with
cubic structure (e.g. NiO.Cr 2O3and FeO.Cr 2O3). It
is probable that the spinel formation is temperature-dependent, with Cr
2O3forming at low temperatures
and the spinel at higher ones.
Stainless steels (ferritic, austenitic or martensitic)
are among the best oxidation-resistant alloys and are
based on Fe–Cr. When iron is heated above about
570°C the oxide scale which forms consists of w ¨ustite,
FeO (a p-type semiconductor) next to the metal,
magnetite Fe 3O4(ap-type semiconductor) next and
haematiteFe 2O3(ann-typesemiconductor)ontheout-
side. When Cr is added at low concentrations the Cr
forms a spinel FeO.CrO 3with the w ¨ustite and later
with the other two oxides. However, a minimum Cr
addition of 12% is required before the inner layer is
replaced by Cr 2O3below a thin outer layer of Fe 2O3.
Heat-resistant steels for service at temperatures above
1000°Cusuallycontain18% Crormore,andaustenitic
stainless steels 18% Cr, 8% Ni. The growth of Cr 2O3
on austenitic stainless steels containing up to 20% Crappears to be rate-controlled by chromium diffusion.
Kinetic factors determine whether Cr
2O3or a duplex
spinel oxide form, the nucleation of Cr 2O3is favoured
by higher Cr levels, higher temperatures and by sur-
face treatments (e.g. deformation), which increase the
diffusivity. Surface treatments which deplete the sur-
face of Cr promotetheformationof spineloxide.Once
Cr2O3is formed, if this ﬁlm is removed or disrupted,then spinel oxidation is favoured because of the local
lowering of Cr.
When chromium-bearing alloys, such as austenitic
stainless steels, are exposed to the hot combustionproducts of fossil fuels, the outer layer of
chromium oxide which forms is often associated
with an underlying sulphide phase (Figure 12.3a).This duplex structure can be explained by usingphase (stability) diagrams and the concept of
‘reaction paths’. Previously, in Section 3.2.8.5, it
was indicated that a two-dimensional section couldbe taken through the full three-dimensional diagramfor a metal–sulphur–oxygen system (Figure 3.23).
Accordingly, in a similar way, we can extract an
isothermal section from the full phase diagram forthe Cr–S–O system, as shown in Figure 12.3b. Thechemical activities of sulphur and oxygen in thegas phase are functions of their partial pressures
(concentration). If the partial pressure of sulphur is
relatively low, the composition of the gas phase willlie within the chromium oxide ﬁeld and the alloy willoxidize (Figure 12.3b). Sulphur and oxygen diffuse
throughthegrowinglayerofoxidescalebutS
2diffuses
faster than O 2, accordingly, the composition of the gas
phase in contact with the alloy follows a ‘reactionpath’, as depicted by the dashed line. Figure 12.3c
shows the reaction path for gases with a higher initial
partial pressure of sulphur. Its slope is such that ﬁrstchromium oxide forms, and then chromium sulphide(i.e. Cr CSDCrS). Sometimes the oxide scale may
crack or form voids. In such cases, the activity of S

382Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
may rise locally within the scale and far exceed that of
themaingasphase.Sulphidationofthechromiumthen
becomes likely, despite a low concentration of sulphur
in the main gas stream (Figure 12.3d).
Relative tendencies of different metallic elements to
oxidize and/or sulphidize at a given temperature may
be gauged by superimposingtheir isothermal pS2/NULpO2
diagrams, as in Figure 12.4. For example, with the
heat-resistant 80Ni–20Cr alloy ( Nichrome ), it can be
reasoned that (1) Cr 2O3scale and CrS subscale are
both stable in the presence of nickel, and (2) Cr 2O3
forms in preference to NiO; that is, at much lowerpartial pressures of oxygen. The physical state of a
condensed phase is extremely important because liq-
uid phases favour rapid diffusion and thus promote
corrosive reactions. Although nickel has a higher sul-
phidationthreshold than chromium, the Ni–NiS eutec-
tic reaction is of particular concern with Ni-containing
alloys because it takes place at the relatively low tem-
perature of 645
°C.
12.2.2 Aqueous corrosion
12.2.2.1 Electrochemistry of corrosion
Metalscorrode in aqueousenvironmentsby an electro-
chemical mechanism involving the dissolution of the
metal as ions (e.g. Fe !Fe2CC2e). The excess elec-
trons generated in the electrolyte either reduce hydro-
gen ions (particularly in acid solutions) according to
2HCC2e!H2
so that gas is evolved from the metal, or create
hydroxyl ions by the reduction of dissolved oxygen
according to
O2C4eC2H2O!4OH/NUL
The corrosion rate is therefore associated with the
ﬂow of electrons or an electrical current. The two
reactions involving oxidation (in which the metal ion-
izes) and reduction occur at anodic and cathodic sites,
respectively, onthemetal surface. Generally, themetal
Figure 12.4 Superimposition of isothermal sections from
Cr–S–OandNi–S–Osystems .surface consists of both anodic and cathodic sites,
depending on segregation, microstructure, stress, etc.,but if the metal is partially-immersed there is often
a distinct separation of the anodic and cathodic areas
withthelatternearthewaterlinewhereoxygenisread-
ily dissolved (differential aeration). Figure 12.5 illus-
trates the formation of such a differential aeration cell;
Fe
2Cions pass into solution from the anode and OH/NUL
ions from the cathode, and where they meet they form
ferrous hydroxide Fe(OH)2. However, depending on
the aeration, this may oxidize to Fe(OH)3, red-rust
Fe2O3.H2O, or black magnetite Fe 3O4. Such a pro-
cess is important when water, particularly seawater,
collects in crevices formed by service, manufacture ordesign. In this form of corrosion the rate-controlling
process is usually the supply of oxygen to the cathodic
areas and, if the cathodic area is large, can often lead
to intense local attack of small anode areas, such as
pits, scratches, crevices, etc.
In the absence of differential aeration, the formation
of anodic and cathodic areas depends on the ability toionize. Some metals ionize easily, others with difﬁ-
culty and consequently anodic and cathodic areas may
be produced, for example, by segregation, or the join-
ing of dissimilar metals. When any metal is immersed
inanaqueoussolutioncontainingitsownions,positiveions go into solution until the resulting electromotive
force (emf) is sufﬁcient to prevent any further solu-
tion; this emf is the electrode potential or half-cell
potential. To measure this emf it is necessary to use
a second reference electrode in the solution, usually
a standard hydrogen electrode. With no current ﬂow-
ing,theappliedpotentialcancelsouttheextrapotentialdeveloped by the spontaneous ionization at the metal

solutions of their own ions, whereas the noble metalshave positive potentials and are deposited from solu-
tion. These differences show that the valency electrons
are strongly bound to the positive core in the noble
metals because of the short distance of interaction, i.e.
d
atomic'dionic. A metal will therefore displace from
solution the ions of a metal more noble than itself in
the Series. When two dissimilar metals are connected
in neutral solution to form a cell, the more metallicmetal becomes the anode and the metal with the lower
tendency to ionize becomes the cathode. The Electro-
chemical Series indicates which metal will corrode inthe cell but gives no information on the rate of reac-
tions. When an anode M corrodes, its ions enter into
the solution initially low in M
Cions, but as current
ﬂows the concentration of ions increases. This leads
to a change in electrode potential known as polariza-tion, as shown in Figure 12.6a, and corresponds to a
reduced tendency to ionize. The current density in the
cell is a maximum when the anode and cathode poten-tial curves intersect. Such a condition would exist if
the two metals were joined together or anode and cath-
ode regions existed on the same metal, i.e. differential
aeration. This potential is referred to as the corrosion
potential and the current, the corrosion current.
In many reactions, particularly in acid solutions,
hydrogen gas is given off at the cathode rather than
the anode metal deposited. In practice, the evolutionof hydrogen gas at the cathode requires a smaller
additional overvoltage, the magnitude of which varies
considerably from one cathode metal to another, andis high for Pb, Sn and Zn and low for Ag, Cu, Fe
and Ni; this overvoltage is clearly of importance in
electrodeposition of metals. In corrosion, the overvolt-
age arising from the activation energy opposing the
electrode reaction decreases the potential of the cell,

i.e. hydrogen atoms effectively shield or polarize the
cathode. The degree of polarization is a function ofcurrentdensityandthepotential Etodrivethereaction
decreases because of the increased rate of H
2evolu-
tion, as shown in Figure 12.7 for the corrosion of zincand iron in acid solutions. Corrosion can develop upto a rate given by the current when the potential differ-ence required to drive the reaction is zero; for zinc thisisi
Znand for iron iFe. Because of its large overvoltage
zinc is corroded more slowly than iron, even thoughthere is a larger difference between zinc and hydrogenthan iron and hydrogen in the Electrochemical Series.The presence of Pt in the acid solution, because ofits low overvoltage, increases the corrosion rate as itplates out on the cathode metal surface. In neutral oralkaline solutions, depolarization is brought about bysupplyingoxygentothecathodeareawhichreactswiththe hydrogen ions as shown in Figure 12.6b. In theabsence of oxygen both anodic and cathodic reactionsexperience polarization and corrosion ﬁnally stops; it
is well-known that iron does not rust in oxygen-freewater.
It is apparent that the cell potential depends on the
electrode material, the ion concentration of the elec-trolyte,passivityand polarizationeffects. Thusitisnotalways possible to predict the precise electrochemicalbehaviour merely from the Electrochemical Series (i.e.which metal will be anode or cathode) and the mag-nitude of the cell voltage. Therefore it is necessary todetermine the speci ﬁc behaviour of different metals in
solutions of different acidity. The results are displayedusually in Pourbaix diagrams as shown in Figure 12.8.With stainless steel, for example, the anodic polariza-tion curve is not straightforward as discussed previ-ously, but takes the form shown in Figure 12.9, wherethe low-current region corresponds to the condition ofpassivity. The corrosion rate depends on the positionat which the cathode polarization curve for hydrogenevolution crosses this anode curve, and can be quitehigh if it crosses outside the passive region. Pourbaixdiagrams map out the regions of passivity for solu-tions of different acidity. Figure 12.8 shows that thepassive region is restricted to certain conditions of
Figure 12.7 Corrosion of zinc and iron and the effect of
polarization .pH; for Ti this is quite extensive but Ni is passive
only in very acid solutions and Al in neutral solu-
tions. Interestingly, these diagrams indicate that for Ti
and Ni in contact with each other in corrosive con-
ditions then Ni would corrode, and that passivity has
changed their order in the Electrochemical Series. In
general, passivity is maintained by conditions of high
oxygen concentration but is destroyed by the presence
of certain ions such as chlorides.
The corrosion behaviour of metals and alloys can
therefore be predicted with certainty only by obtaining
experimental data under simulated service conditions.
For practical purposes, the cell potentials of many
materials have been obtained in a single environment,
themostcommonbeingseawater.Suchdataintabular
form are called a Galvanic Series, as illustrated in
Table 12.2. If a pair of metals from this Series were
connected together in sea water, the metal which is
higher in the Series would be the anode and corrode,
and the further they are apart, the greater the corrosion
tendency. Similar data exist for other environments.
12.2.2.2 Protection against corrosion
The principles of corrosion outlined above indicate
several possible methods of controlling corrosion.
Since current must pass for corrosion to proceed, any
factor, such as cathodic polarization which reduces the
current, will reduce the corrosion rate. Metals having
a high overvoltage should be utilized where possi-
ble. In neutral and alkaline solution de-aeration of the
electrolyte to remove oxygen is bene ﬁcial in reducing
corrosion (e.g. heating the solution or holding under
a reduced pressure preferably of an inert gas). It is
sometimes possible to reduce both cathode and anode
reactions by ‘artiﬁcial’polarization (for example, by
adding inhibitors which sti ﬂe the electrode reaction).
Calcium bicarbonate, naturally present in hard water,
deposits calcium carbonate on metal cathodes and sti-
ﬂes the reaction. Soluble salts of magnesium and zinc
actsimilarlybyprecipitatinghydroxideinneutralsolu-
tions.
Anodic inhibitors for ferrous materials include pota-
ssium chromate and sodium phosphate, which convert
the Fe2Cions to insoluble precipitates sti ﬂing the
anodic reaction. This form of protection has no effect
on the cathodic reaction and hence if the inhibitor fails
to seal off the anode completely, intensive local attack
occurs, leading to pitting. Moreover, the small current
densityatthecathodeleadstoalowrateofpolarization
and the attack is maintained. Sodium benzoate is often
used as an anodic inhibitor in water radiators because
of its good sealing qualities, with little tendency for
pitting.
Some metals are naturally protected by their adher-
ent oxide ﬁlms; metal oxides are poor electrical con-
ductors and so insulate the metal from solution. For
the reaction to proceed, metal atoms have to diffuse
through the oxide to the metal –liquid interface and
electrons back through the high-resistance oxide. The

Cathodic or most noble
corrosion current is very much reduced by the forma-
tion of such protective or passive oxide ﬁlms. Al is
cathodic to zinc in sea water even though the Electro-chemical Series shows it to be more active. Materials
which are passivated in this way are chromium, stain-
less steels, Inconeland nickel in oxidizing conditions.
Reducing environments (e.g. stainless steels in HCl)
386Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
destroy the passive ﬁlm and render the materials active
to corrosion attack. Certain materials may be artiﬁ-cially passivated by painting. The main pigments usedare red lead, zinc oxide and chromate, usually sus-pended in linseed oil and thinned with white spirit.Slightly soluble chromates in the paint passivate theunderlying metal when water is present. Red leadreacts with the linseed oil to form lead salts of variousfatty acids which are good anodic inhibitors.
Sacriﬁcial or cathodic protection is widely used. A
typical example is galvanized steel sheet when the
steel is protected by sacriﬁcial corrosion of the zinccoating. Any regions of steel exposed by small ﬂawsin the coating polarize rapidly since they are cathodicand small in area; corrosion products also tend to plugthe holes in the Zn layer. Cathodic protection is alsoused for ships and steel pipelines buried underground.Auxiliary sacriﬁcial anodes are placed at frequentintervals in the corrosive medium in contact with theship’s hull or pipe. Protection may also be achieved by
impressing a d.c. voltage to make it a cathode, with
the negative terminal of the d.c. source connected to asacriﬁcial anode.
12.2.2.3 Corrosion failures
In service, there are many types of corrosive attackwhich lead to rapid failure of components. A familiarexample is intergranular corrosion and is associatedwith the tendency for grain boundaries to undergolocalized anodic attack. Some materials are, however,particularly sensitive. The common example of thissensitizationoccurs in 18Cr–8Ni stainless steel, whichis normally protected by a passivating Cr
2O3ﬁlm after
heating to 500–800 °C and slowly cooling. During
cooling, chromium near the grain boundaries precip-
itates as chromium carbide. As a consequence, these
regions are depleted in Cr to levels below 12% and areno longer protected by the passive oxide ﬁlm. Theybecome anodic relative to the interior of the grain and,being narrow, are strongly attacked by the corrosioncurrent generated by the cathode reactions elsewhere.Sensitization may be avoided by rapid cooling, but inlarge structures that is not possible, particularly afterwelding, when the phenomenon (called weld decay) iscommon. The effect is then overcome by stabilizing
the stainless steel by the addition of a small amount
(0.5%) of a strong carbide-former such as Nb or Tiwhich associates with the carbon in preference to theCr.Otherformsofcorrosionfailurerequirethecompo-nent to be stressed, either directly or by residual stress.Common examples include stress-corrosion cracking(SCC) and corrosion-fatigue. Hydrogen embrittlementis sometimes included in this category but this type offailure has somewhat different characteristics and hasbeenconsideredpreviously.Thesefailureshavecertain
features in common. SCC occurs in chemically active
environments; susceptible alloys develop deep ﬁssuresalong active slip planes, particularly alloys with lowstacking-fault energy with wide dislocations and pla-nar stackingfaults,oralonggrainboundaries.For suchselective chemical action the free energy of reaction
can provide almost all the surface energy for fracture,
which may then spread under extremely low stresses.
Stress corrosion cracking was ﬁrst observed in
˛-brass cartridge cases stored in ammoniacal envi-
ronments. The phenomenon, called season-cracking
since it occurred more frequently during the mon-
soon season in the tropics, was prevented by giving
the cold-worked brass cases a mild annealing treat-
ment to relieve the residual stresses of cold forming.The phenomenon has since extended to many alloys in
different environments (e.g. Al–Cu, Al–Mg, Ti–Al),
magnesium alloys, stainless steels in the presence of
chloride ions, mild steels with hydroxyl ions (caustic
embrittlement) and copper alloys with ammonia ions.
Stress corrosion cracking can be either transgran-
ular or intergranular. There appears to be no unique
mechanism of transgranular stress corrosion cracking,
since no single factor is common to all susceptible
alloys. In general, however, all susceptible alloys areunstable in the environment concerned but are largely
protected by a surface ﬁlm that is locally destroyed
in some way. The variations on the basic mechanism
arise from the different ways in which local activity
is generated. Breakdown in passivity may occur as aresult of the emergence of dislocation pile-ups, stack-
ing faults, micro-cracks, precipitates (such as hydrides
in Ti alloys) at the surface of the specimen, so that
highly localized anodic attack then takes place. The
gradual opening of the resultant crack occurs by plas-tic yielding at the tip and as the liquid is sucked in
also prevents any tendency to polarize.
Manyalloysexhibitcoarseslipandhavesimilardis-
location substructures(e.g. co-planar arrays of disloca-
tionsorwideplanarstackingfaults)butarenotequallysusceptible to stress-corrosion. The observation has
been attributed to the time necessary to repassivate
an active area. Additions of Cr and Si to susceptible
austenitic steels, for example, do not signiﬁcantly alter
the dislocation distribution but are found to decreasethesusceptibilitytocracking,probablybyloweringthe
repassivation time.
The susceptibility to transgranular stress corrosion
of austenitic steels, ˛-brasses, titanium alloys, etc.
which exhibit co-planar arrays of dislocations andstacking faultsmay be reduced by raisingthe stacking-
fault energy by altering the alloy composition. Cross-
slip is then made easier and deformation gives rise to
ﬁne slip, so that the narrower, fresh surfaces created
have a less severe effect. The addition of elements topromote passivation or, more importantly, the speed of
repassivation should also prove beneﬁcial.
Intergranular cracking appears to be associated with
a narrow soft zone near the grain boundaries. In ˛-
brass this zone may be produced by local dezinciﬁca-tion. In high-strengthAl-alloys there is no doubt that it
is associated with the grain boundary precipitate-free
zones (i.e. PFZs). In such areas the strain-rate may be
so rapid, because the strain is localized, that repassiva-
tioncannotoccur. Crackingthenproceedseven though
Corrosion and surface engineering 387
the slip steps developed are narrow, the crack dis-
solving anodically as discussed for sensitized stainlesssteel.In practicethereare many examplesofintergran-ular cracking, including cases (1) that depend stronglyon stress (e.g. Al-alloys), (2) where stress has a com-paratively minor role (e.g. steel cracking in nitrate
solutions) and (3) which occur in the absence of stress
(e.g. sensitized 18Cr–8Ni steels); the last case is theextreme example of failure to repassivate for purelyelectrochemical reasons. In some materials the crackpropagates, as in ductile failure, by internal neckingbetween inclusions which occurs by a combination of
stress and dissolution processes. The stress sensitivity
depends on the particle distribution and is quite highfor ﬁne-scale and low for coarse-scale distributions.The change in precipitate distribution in grain bound-ariesproduced,forexample,byduplexageingcanthuschange the stress-dependence of intergranular failure.
In conditions where the environment plays a role,
the crack growth rate varies with stress intensity K
in the manner shown in Figure 12.10. In region I thecrack velocity shows a marked dependence on stress,in region II the velocity is independent of the stressintensity and in region III the rate becomes very fast
asK
ICis approached. KISCis extensively quoted as
the threshold stress intensity below which the crack
growth rate is negligible (e.g. /lessorsimilar10/NUL10ms/NUL1) but, like
the endurance limit in fatigue, does not exist for allmaterials. In region I the rate of crack growth is
controlled by the rate at which the metal dissolves
and the time for which the metal surface is exposed.While anodic dissolution takes place on the exposedmetal at the crack tip, cathodic reactions occur at theoxideﬁlmonthecracksidesleadingtotheevolutionofhydrogenwhichdiffusestotheregionoftriaxialtensile
stress and hydrogen-induced cracking. At higher stress
intensities (region II) the strain-rate is higher, andthen other processes become rate-controlling, such as
Figure 12.10 Variation of crack growth rate with stress
intensity during corrosion .diffusion of new reactants into the crack tip region.
In hydrogen embrittlement this is probably the rate of
hydrogen diffusion.
The inﬂuence of a corrosive environment, even
mildly oxidizing, in reducing the fatigue life has been
brieﬂy mentioned in Chapter 7. The S–Ncurve shows
no tendency to level out, but falls to low S-values. The
damage ratio(i.e. corrosion fatiguestrengthdividedbythe normal fatigue strength) in salt water environments
is only about 0.5 for stainless steels and 0.2 for mild
steel. Theformationofintrustionsandextrusionsgives
rise to fresh surface steps which form very active
anodic sites in aqueous environments, analogous to
the situation at the tip of a stress corrosion crack.
This form of fatigue is inﬂuenced by those factors
affecting normal fatigue but, in addition, involves
electro-chemical factors. It is normally reduced by
plating,claddingandpaintingbutdifﬁcultiesmayarise
inlocalizingtheattacktoasmallnumberofsites,since
the surface is continually being deformed. Anodic
inhibitors may also reduce the corrosion fatigue but
their use is more limited than in the absence of fatigue
because of the probability of incomplete inhibition
leading to increased corrosion.
Fretting corrosion, caused by two surfaces rubbing
together, is associated with fatigue failure. The oxi-
dation and corrosion product is continually removed,
so that the problem must be tackled by improving the
mechanical linkage of moving parts and by the effec-
tive use of lubricants.
With corrosion fatigue, the fracture mechanics

this reduced and the rate of crack
propagation is usually increased by a factor of two
or so. Much larger increases in crack growth rate are
produced, however, in low-frequency cycling when
stress-corrosion fatigue effects become important.

12.3.1 The coating and modiﬁcation of
surfaces
The action of the new methods for coating or modi-
fying material surfaces, such as vapour deposition and
beambombardment,canbehighlyspeciﬁcandenergy-
efﬁcient. They allow great ﬂexibility in controlling the
chemical composition and physical structure of sur-
faces and many materials which resisted conventional
treatments can now be processed. Grain size and the
degree of crystalline perfection can be varied over a
wide range and beneﬁcial changes in properties pro-
duced. The new techniques often eliminate the need
for the random diffusion of atoms so that tempera-
tures can be relatively low and processing times short.
Scientiﬁcally, they are intriguing because their nature

The number and diversity of methods for coating or
modifying surfaces makes general classiﬁcation difﬁ-
cult. For instance, the energies required by the various
processes extend over some ﬁve orders of magni-tude. Illustrating this point, sputtered atoms have a
low thermal energy ( <1 eV) whereas the energy of
an ion beam can be >100 keV. A useful introductory
classiﬁcation of methods for coating and modifying
material surfaces appears in Table 12.3, which takessome account of the different forms of mass trans-
fer. The ﬁrst column refers to coatings formed from
atoms and ions (e.g. vapour deposition). The second
column refers to coatings formed from liquid droplets
or small particles. A third category refers to the directapplication of coating material in quantity (e.g. paint).
Finally, there are methods for the near-surface modiﬁ-
cation of materials by chemical, mechanical and ther-
malmeansandbybombardment(e.g.ionimplantation,
laser processing).
Some of the methods that utilize deposition from
a vapour phase or direct bombardment with particles,
ions or radiation will be outlined: it will be apparent
that each of the processes discussed has three stages:
(1) a source provides the coating or modifying specie,(2) this specie is transported from source to substrate
and(3) thespeciepenetratesandmodiﬁesthesubstrate
or forms an overlay. Each stage is, to a great extent,independent of the other two stages, tending to give
each process an individual versatility.
12.3.2 Surface coating by vapour deposition
12.3.2.1 Chemical vapour deposition
In the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process a
coating of metal, alloy or refractory compound isproduced by chemical reaction between vapour and acarrier gas at or near the heated surface of a substrate
(Figures 12.11a and 12.11b). CVD is not a ‘line-of-
sight’ process and can coat complex shapes uniformly,
having good ‘throwing power’.
1Typical CVD reac-
tions for depositing boron nitride and titanium carbide,
respectively, are:
BCl3⊿g/triangleleftCNH3⊿g/triangleleft500–1500 °C/NUL/NUL/NUL/NUL/NUL/NUL!BN⊿s/triangleleftC3HCl ⊿g/triangleleft
TiCl4⊿g/triangleleftCCH4⊿g/triangleleft800–1000 °C/NUL/NUL/NUL/NUL/NUL/NUL!TiC⊿s/triangleleftC4HCl ⊿g/triangleleft
It will be noted that the substrate temperatures,
whichcontroltherateofdeposition,arerelativelyhigh.
Accordingly, although CVD is suitable for coating
a refractory compound, like cobalt-bonded tungsten
carbide, it will soften a hardened and tempered high-
speed tool steel, making it necessary to repeat thehigh-temperature heat-treatment. In one variant of the
process (PACVD) deposition is plasma-assisted by a
plate locatedabove thesubstratewhichischarged with
a radio-frequency bias voltage. The resulting plasma
zone inﬂuences the structure of the coating. PACVDis used to produce ceramic coatings (SiC, Si
3N4) but
the substrate temperature of 650 °C (minimum) is still
too high for heat-treated alloy steels. The maximumcoating thickness produced economically by CVD and
PACVD is about 100
µm.
12.3.2.2 Physical vapour deposition
Although there are numerous versions of the physicalvapour deposition (PVD) process, their basic design is
1The term ‘throwing power’ conventionally refers to the
ability of an electroplating solution to deposit metaluniformly on a cathode of irregular shape.
Corrosion and surface engineering 389

either evaporation- or sputter-dependent. In the former
case, the source material is heated by high-energy
beam (electron, ion, laser), resistance, induction, etc.in a vacuum chamber (Figure 12.12a). The rate ofevaporation depends upon the vapour pressure of the
source and the chamber pressure. Metals vaporize at
a reasonable rate if their vapour pressure exceeds
1Nm
/NUL2and the chamber pressure is below 10/NUL3Nm/NUL2. The evaporant atoms travel towards the substrate
(component), essentially following lines-of-sight.
When sputtering is used in PVD (Figure 12.12b),
a cathode source operates under an applied poten-
tial of up to 5 kV (direct-current or radio-frequency)
in an atmosphere of inert gas (Ar). The vacuum is
‘softer’,withachamberpressureof1–10/NUL2Nm/NUL2.As
positive argon ions bombard the target, momentum is
390Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
transferred and the ejected target atoms form a coating
on the substrate. The ‘throwing power’ of sputter-dependent PVD is good and coating thicknesses areuniform. The process beneﬁts from the fact that the
sputtering yield ( Y) values for metals are fairly simi-
lar. (Yis the average number of target atoms ejected
from the surface per incident ion, as determined exper-
imentally.) In contrast, with an evaporation source, for
agiventemperature,theratesofvaporizationcandifferby several orders of magnitude.
As in CVD, the temperature of the substrate is of
special signiﬁcance. In PVD, this temperature can be
as low as 200–400
°C, making it possible to apply the
method to cutting and metal-forming tools of hard-
ened steel. A titanium nitride (TiN) coating, <5µm
thick, can enhance tool life considerably (e.g. twistdrills). TiN is extremely hard (2400 HV), has a low
coefﬁcient of friction and a very smooth surface tex-
ture. TiN coatings can also be applied to non-ferrousalloys and cobalt-bonded tungsten carbide. Experiencewith the design of a TiN-coated steel has demonstrated
thatthecoating/substratesystemmustbeconsideredas
a working whole. A sound overlay of wear-resistantmaterial on a tough material may fail prematurely
if working stresses cause plastic deformation of the
supporting substrate. For this reason, and in accor-dance with the newly-emerging principles of surfaceengineering, it has been recommended that steel sur-
faces should be strengthened by nitriding before a TiN
coating is applied by PVD.
TwoimportantmodiﬁcationsofthePVDprocessare
plasma-assisted physical vapour deposition (PAPVD)
and magnetron sputtering. In PAPVD, also known as‘ion plating’, deposition in a ‘soft’ vacuum is assisted
by bombardment with ions. This effect is produced
by applying a negative potential of 2–5 kV to thesubstrate. PAPVD is a hybrid of the evaporation-and sputter-dependent forms of PVD. Strong bonding
of the PAPVD coating to the substrate requires the
latter to be free from contamination. Accordingly, in
a critical preliminary stage, the substrate is cleansed
by bombardment with positive ions. The source is
then energized and metal vapour is allowed into the
chamber.
In the basic magnetron-assisted version of sputter-
dependent PVD, a magnetic ﬁeld is used to form
a dense plasma close to the target. The magnetron,
an array of permanent magnets or electromagnets, is
attachedtotherear ofthetarget (water-cooled)withits
north and south poles arranged to produce a magnetic
ﬁeldatrightanglestotheelectricﬁeldbetweenthetar-
get and substrate (Figure 12.13a). This magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁnes electrons close to the target surface, increases
the rate of ionization and produces a much denser
plasma. The improved ionization efﬁciency allows a
lower chamber pressure to be used; sputtered target
atoms then become less likely to be scattered by gas
molecules. The net effect is to improve the rate of
deposition at the substrate. Normally the region of
dense plasma only extends up to about 6 cm from the
target surface. Development of unbalanced magnetron
systems (Figure 12.13b) has enabled the depth of the
dense plasma zone to be extended so that the substrate
itselfissubjectedtoionbombardment.Theseenergetic
ionsmodifythechemicalandphysicalpropertiesofthe
deposit. (In one of the various unbalanced magnetron
conﬁgurations, a ring of strong rare-earth magnetic
poles surrounds a weak central magnetic pole.) This
larger plasma zone can accommodate large complex
workpieces and rapidly forms dense, non-columnar
coatings of metals or alloys. Target/substrate separa-
tion distances up to 20 cm have been achieved with
unbalanced magnetron systems.

12.3.3 Surface coating by particle
bombardment
Since the ﬁrst practical realization of gas turbine
engines in the 1940s, the pace of engineering devel-
opment has largely been prescribed by the availability
of suitable high-temperature materials. Components inthe most critical sections of the engine are exposed tohotproductsofcombustionmovingathighvelocity.In
addition, there are destructive agents passing through
the engine, such as sea salt and sand. In this hostileenvironment,itisextremelydifﬁcult,ifnotimpossible,to develop an alloy that combines the necessary high-
temperature strength with corrosion resistance. Much
efforthasthereforebeendevotedtothesearchforalloysystems that will develop a thin self-healing ‘protec-tive’ oxide scale. In practice, this outer layer does not
prevent diffusing atoms from reaching and reacting
with the alloy substrate and it may also be subject tothinning by erosion. The difference in thermal expan-sionbetweentheoxide(ceramic)scaleandthemetallicsubstrate can lead to rupture and spalling of the scale
if the scale lacks plasticity or is weakly bonded to the
alloy. Refractory coatings which resist wear and cor-rosion provide one possible answer to these problems.
Thetwoestablishedthermalspraymethods
1ofcoat-
ing selected here for brief description are used for
gas turbine components. In thermal spraying, pow-ders are injected into very hot gases and projected atvery high velocities onto the component (substrate)
surface. On impact, the particles plastically deform
and adhere strongly to the substrate and each other.The structure, which often has a characteristic lentic-ular appearance in cross-section, typically comprises
refractory constituents, such as carbide, oxide and/or
aluminide, and a binding alloy phase. Many types ofthermally sprayed coatings can operate at temperatures>1000
°C. They range in thickness from microns to
millimetres, as required.

occur four to eight times per second, the barrel ispurged with nitrogen. Typical applications, and coat-ing compositions, for wear-resistant D-Guncoatings

12.3.4 Surface modiﬁcation with high-energy
beams
12.3.4.1 Ion implantation
The chemical composition and physical structure at
the surface of a material can be changed by bombard-ing it,in vacuo, with a high-velocity stream of ions.
The beam energy is typically about 100 keV; efforts
are being made to increase the beam current above5 mA so that process times can be shortened. Cur-rently, implantation requires several hours. The ions

Weatherill and Gill, 1988; by permission of the Institute of

may be derived from any element in the Periodic
Table: they may be light (most frequently nitrogen)
or heavy, even radioactive. Ion implantation1is a line-
of-sight process; typically, a bombardment dose for
each square centimetre of target surface is in the order
of 1017–1019ions. These ions penetrate to a depth
of 100–200 nm and their concentration proﬁle in a
plane normal to the surface is Gaussian. Beyond this
modiﬁed region, the properties of the substrate are
unaffected.
The beam usually has a sputtering effect which
ejects atoms from the surface and skews the concen-
tration proﬁle. This effect is most marked when heavyions or heavy doses are used. It is possible for a steady
state to be achieved, with the rate of sputter erosion
equal to the rate of implantation. Thus, depending
upon the target, the type and energy of ion and the
substrate material, sputter erosion is capable of limit-ing the amount of implantation possible. As a general
guide, the maximum concentration of implanted ion is
given,roughly,bythereciprocalofthesputteringyield(Y). As one would expect, Yincreases in value with
increases in ion energy. However, Yvalues for pure
metals are broadly similar, being about 1 or 2 for typi-
calargonionenergiesandnotdifferingfromeachother
by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, because ofsputter, the maximum concentration of implanted ions
possible is in the order of 40–50 at.%. In cases where
it is difﬁcult to attain this concentration, a thin layer ofthe material to be implanted is ﬁrst deposited and then
driven into the substrate by bombardment with inert
gas ions (argon, krypton, xenon). This indirect method
is called ‘ion beam mixing’.
During ion bombardment each atom in the near-
surface region is displaced many times. Various forms
of structural damage are produced by the cascades of
collisions(e.g.displacementspikes,vacancy/interstitial(Frenkel) pairs, dislocation tangles and loops, etc.).
Damage cascades are most concentrated when heavy
ions bombard target atoms of high atomic number (Z).
1Pioneered by the UKAEA, Harwell, in the 1960s.The injection of atoms and the formation of vacancies
tend to increase the volume of the target material sothat the restraint imposed by the substrate produces astate of residual compressive stress. Fatigue resistance
is therefore likely to be enhanced.
As indicated previously, the ions penetrate to a
depth of about 300–500 atoms. Penetration is greater
in crystalline materials than in glasses, particularly
when the ions ‘channel’ between low-index planes.The collision ‘cross-section’ of target atoms for lightions is relatively small and ions penetrate deeply.
Ion implantation can be closely controlled, the main
process variables being beam energy, ion species, iondose, temperature and substrate material.
Ion implantation is used in the doping of semicon-
ductors, as discussed in Chapter 6, and to improveengineering properties such as resistance to wear,fatigue and corrosion. The process temperature is
less than 150
°C; accordingly, heat-treated alloy steels
can be implanted without risk of tempering effects.Nitrogen-implantation is applied to steel and tungsten
carbide tools, and, in the plastics industry, has greatly
improved the wear resistance of feed screws, extrusiondies, nozzles, etc. The process has also been used tosimulateneutrondamageeffectsinlow-swellingalloys
being screened for use in atomic ﬁssion and fusion
reactors. A few hours’ test exposure to an ion beamcan represent a year in a reactor because the ions have
a larger ‘cross-section’ of interaction with the atoms in
thetargetmaterialthanneutrons.However,ionscannotsimulate neutron behaviour completely; unlike neu-trons, ions are electrically charged and travel smaller
distances (see Chapter 6).
12.3.4.2 Laser processing
Likeionimplantation,thelaser2processisunderactive
development. A laser beam heats the target material
locally to a very high temperature; its effects extend
to a depth of 10–100 µm, which is about a thousand
times greater than that for an ion beam. Depending on
itsenergy, itcan heat, melt, vaporizeor form a plasma.
The duration of the energy pulse can be 1 ns or less.Subsequent cooling may allow a metallic target zoneto recrystallize, possibly with a reﬁned substructure,
or undergo an austenite/martensite transformation (e.g.
automotive components). There is usually an epitaxialrelation between the altered near-surface region and
the substrate. Cooling may even be rapid enough to
formaglassystructure(laserglazing).Surfacealloyingcan be achieved by pre-depositing an alloy on thesubstrate, heating this deposit with a laser beam to
form a miscible melt and allowing to cool. In this way,
an integral layer of austenitic corrosion-resistant steelcan be built on a ferritic steel substrate. In addition to

(LASER) devices provide photons of electromagneticradiation that are in-phase (coherent) and monochromatic(see Chapter 6).
Corrosion and surface engineering 393
its use in alloying and heat-treatment, laser processing
is used to enhance etching and electroplating. (e.g.
semiconductors).
The principal variables in laser processing are the
energy input and the pulse duration. For establishedtechniques like cutting, drilling and welding metals,the rate of energy transfer per unit area (‘power den-
sity’) is in the order of 1 MW cm
/NUL2and pulses
are of relatively long duration (say, 1 ms). For more
specialized functions, such as metal hardening by
shock wave generation, the corresponding values are
approximately 100 MW cm/NUL2and 1 ns. Short pulses
can produce rapid quenching effects and metastablephases.Further reading

Biomaterials
13.1 Introduction
Biomaterials are materials used in medicine and den-
tistry that are intended to come in contact with liv-
ing tissue. The familiar tooth ﬁlling is where most
humans ﬁrst encounter biomaterials but increasinglymany people now rely on more critical implants suchas joint replacements, particularly hips, and cardiovas-cular repairs. Undoubtedly, these biomaterial implantsimprove the quality of life for an increasing numberof people each year, not just for an ageing populationwith greater life expectancy, but for younger peoplewith heart problems, injuries or inherited diseases.
Biomaterials have now been successfully developed
and used for more than a generation. First-generationbiomaterials largely depended on being inert, or rel-
atively inert, with minimal tissue response. For these
materials a minimal ﬁbrous layer forms between thebiomaterials and the body when the material is nottotally accepted by the body. The success of this typeof implant depends largely on the selection of materi-als for their manufacture. Thus the now standard hipreplacement (almost a million worldwide each year)initially used a multi-component assembly made withaustenitic stainless steel for the stem, PMMA for ﬁx-ation and polyethylene for the acetabular cup (seeFigure 13.1). All the materials proved relatively bio-
inert and gave an average life time of 10 years or
more.
Nowadays, while continuing with improved bio-
inert materials, development has focused on bioactivematerials which inﬂuence the biological response ina positive way, e.g. encourage bonding to surround-ing tissue with stimulation of new bone growth. Withthisbio-activeapproachtheinterfacebetweenthebodycells and the implant is critical and the materials sci-ence of the biomaterials surface extremely important.
In this chapter, various applications of biomaterials
will be examined, from dental materials to drug deliv-
ery systems. All types of materials are used in these
applications and the criteria governing their selection
Figure 13.1 Schematic diagram of a replacement hip joint .
will be considered together with future development
in the biomaterials ﬁeld.
13.2 Requirements for biomaterials
The requirements for a biomaterial are extremelydemanding. Replacement or repair of a body feature,
tissue, organ or function often necessitates the mate-
rial used to have specialised mechanical, physical and
chemical properties. However, the very ﬁrst require-
ment is biocompatibility with the human body, i.e. theability of the material to perform with an appropriate
hostresponse.Unfortunately,nomaterialisuniversally
biocompatible, since a material may be biocompatible
in one application but not with another. Biocompati-
bility is therefore application speciﬁc.
For the successful use of the biomaterial, consider-
ation has to be given to the appropriate material selec-tion, engineering design and manufacturing process.
While proper design and manufacture is essential, it is
particularly important to select the correct material to
providetheappropriatepropertiesaswellasbeingbio-
compatible,recognizingthatthecombinedinﬂuenceof
mechanical and chemical factors can be quite serious,
e.g. causingfatigue,corrosionfatigue,stresscorrosion,wear, fracture. It is also important to recognize that the
Biomaterials 395
biological environment is not constant and that oxygen
levels, availability of free radicals and cellular activity
will vary. Corrosion and degradation can lead to lossof integrity of the implant and, of course, release ionsinto the body, often setting up an allergic reaction.
Biomaterial applications make use of all classes of
material, metals, ceramics, polymers and composites,
divided roughly into three usertypes. These are(i) inert or relatively inert with minimal host response,(ii) bioactive which actually stimulates bonding tothe surrounding tissue and (iii) biodegradable whichresorb in the body over a period of time. Metals
are generally chosen for their inert qualities whereas
ceramics and polymers may offer bioactivity orresorption.
The most common metallic materials used are
austenitic stainless steels, cobalt–chromium alloys or
titanium;typicalcompositionsareshowninTable 13.1.
Recently, titanium alloys, particularly Ti–6Al–4V,have been introduced because of their corrosion resis-tance, strength and elastic modulus (see Table 13.2)but poor tribology can still be a problem. It is alsofavoured for its superior biocompatibility and, unlike
Co–Cr or stainless steel, does not cause hypersen-
sitivity. Of the ceramics, aluminium oxide, calciumphosphate, apatite, carbon/graphite and bioglass are inuse mainly for their inertness, good wear character-istics, high compressive strength and in some casesbioactivity. Their poor tensile properties and fracture
toughness are design limitations. Polymers are widely
used, both alone and in combination with ceram-ics or metals. These include; polymethyl methacry-late (PMMA) for cement and lenses; polyethylene fororthopaedics; polyurethane as blood contact material,
e.g. vascular tubing, cardiovascular devices, catheters;
polysiloxanes in plastic surgery, maxillofacial andcardiovascular surgery; polyesters and polyamides in
woundclosure management. Composites such as ultra-
high-molecular-weight polyethylene reinforced with
either carbon ﬁbres or the ceramic hydroxyapatite are
increasingly being considered for applications involv-
ing high contact stress and wear resistance.
13.3 Dental materials
13.3.1 Cavity ﬁllers
Dentistry has always been very dependent on the
use of biomaterials and particularly receptive to the
application of new developments in metals, ceramics,
polymers and composites.
Dental amalgams have been used in cavity ﬁllings
for more than 100 years, initially with silver–mercury
amalgams, later modiﬁed by tin additions to control
the amount of expansion. These amalgams produced
the weak, corrodible intermetallic /CR2phase, Sn 7Hg,
and hence the modern dental amalgam now also con-
tains copper ( >12%) in order to suppress this phase.
The amalgam is made by mixing silver, tin, cop-
per alloy powder with mercury and this mixture is
packed into the cavity where it hardens to produce a
strong,corrosion-resistant,biocompatibleﬁlling.There
is some evidence that even this ﬁlling may be suscep-tible to corrosion as a result of the Cu
6Sn5⊿/DC10/triangleleftphase
and the addition of Pd has been advocated. Attempts
to replace the Hg amalgam by gallium, indium, sil-
ver, tin, copper pastes have not yet been completely
successful.
Alternative resin-based composite ﬁlling materials
have been continuously developed since ﬁrst intro-
duced in the 1960s. These composite ﬁllings have a

strength similar to amalgams but poorer wear proper-
ties. The paste is created by mixing a dimethacrylate
monomerwithresinandaddingaﬁllerofmicron-sizedsilane-coated ceramic particles. The paste is activatedby strong light when the resin polymerizes. Bondingof the composite resin to the tooth structure employs
a phosphoric acid etch of the tooth enamel. This pro-
duces mini-chasms into which the resin material ﬂowsandlockstoform astrongmechanical bond.Thistech-nique is not successful, however, for bonding to the
dentine in the tooth cavity (Figure 13.2) and so, in
the absence of enamel, dentine bonding agents haveto be used. These are primers containing bifunctionalcompounds with (i) hydrophilic molecules which form
links with the wet dentine in the tooth cavity and (ii)
hydrophobicmoleculeswhichformlinkswiththeresinin the composite.
Cavities in front teeth are usually ﬁlled with glass
cements to match the colour and translucency of the
enamel. Silicate cements are formed when phosphoricaciddisplacesmetalionsfromanalumina–silicaglass,containing metal oxides and ﬂuorides. The cement sets
when aluminium phosphate is precipitated between
the glass particles. Developments based on this basic
Figure 13.2 Schematic diagram of a tooth .chemistry employ polymeric acids with carboxylate
groups. In this case, the metal ions displaced from theglass cross-link with the polymeric acid chain, caus-
ing the cement to set. In addition, the acids undergo an
ion-exchange reaction with the calcium phosphate inthe apatite of the dental material. These glass ionomercements therefore form direct chemical bonds to the
tooth material. Resin-modiﬁed versions are also avail-
able which have improved durability; these containcarboxylate groups to give a good bond to the tooth
and dimethacrylate, as in the composite resin.
13.3.2 Bridges, crowns and dentures
Missing teeth may be replaced by artiﬁcial teeth in
a number of different ways. For a group of missingteeth, removal partial dentures (RPDs) may be theanswer which consist of a cast metal framework of
Co–Cr or Ni–Cr alloy carrying the artiﬁcial teeth
and having end clasps to retain it to good naturalteeth nearby. Fixed partial dentures (FPDs or bridges)
may be used for a few missing teeth. Sometimes the
supportingteethare cutdowntoaccommodate a close-ﬁtting artiﬁcial tooth casting which is cemented intoplace. In other cases, the alloy framework carrying
the artiﬁcial teeth is bonded to acid-etched teeth to
avoid cutting down good teeth. The teeth are acidetched and the metal framework electrolytically etched
to produce structural grooves and chasms which allow
strongmechanicalbondstobeformedwithresin-basedcomposite cements. In some situations, etching can beavoided when the oxides on the metal framework can
be treated with bifunctional primers to form chemical
links to the cement.
Over the last 20 years or so the quality of bonded
restorations, i.e. porcelain-covered metal castings, has
Biomaterials 397
been reﬁned to combine the impact strength of a metal
substructure with the appearance of dental porcelain.
These porcelains have good mechanical properties and
their thermal expansion characteristics are matched to
the metal in order to avoid interfacial stresses and
cracking.
Dental porcelains are basically vitriﬁed feldspar
with metallic oxide pigments to simulate natural tooth
enamel. They are usually supplied to the dental labora-
tories in the reacted and ground form for ﬁnal fabrica-
tionbythetechnician;thisinvolvesmixingthepowder
with distilled water to form a paste which is used to
make the crown, then drying and ﬁring in order to sin-
ter and densify the crown material. Generally, ﬁring is
carried out in stages starting with the innermost struc-
ture of the crown, followed by the body and ﬁnally the
outer glaze and surface staining. Developments have
included the strengthening of the inner core material
with alumina to prevent cracking; also the addition of
magnesia to form a magnesia–alumina spinel which
hasalowshrinkageonﬁring.Glass-ceramicshavealso
been used either to fabricate the crown by casting fol-
lowed by heat treatment to produce crystallization, or
by machining from a pre-ﬁred block of glass-ceramicunder CAM/CAD conditions.
For complete replacement dentures, the basic
material, which has existed for many decades, is
methyl methacrylate. Substitute materials have been
limited and most improvements and developments
have occurred in the processing technology. While
the mechanical properties of denture base resins
are not particularly good (modulus of elasticity 3 ð
10
9Nm/NUL2, tensile strength ¾100 kN m/NUL2, elongation
¾3%) they do have suitable surface and abrasion
properties and are chemically inert, non-toxic
and cheap. Improvements have been forthcoming
in elastomers used for taking impressions; these
now include vinyl addition silicone and polyether
elastomers.
13.3.3 Dental implants
Dental implants have been far less developed thanthose associated with body implants (see hip joints,
etc.). Probably the simplest forms are posts, Co–Cr,
stainless steel, titanium alloy or gold alloys cemented,
or even screwed, into the tooth canal after the tooth
has been root treated to remove the nerve. Dental
porcelain caps may then be cemented onto the root
post. Ti implants have been screwed into the bone
beneath extracted teeth. After some time the pas-
sive surface layer of the titanium implants becomes
osseo-integrated with the bone and can be used as
a strong base onto which a titanium mini structure
can be ﬁtted, complete with tooth assembly. Osseo-
integration is improved by using a coating on thetitanium implant such as hydroxyapatite or bioglass
(Figure 13.3). Ceramic and carbon implants set into
the bone have been used with sapphire single crystals
and pyrolitic graphite as favoured materials.

13.4 The structure of bone and bone
fractures
In repairing bone fractures it is necessary to hold the
bone together while the natural healing process takesplace, usually for a few months. Metallic alloys havebeenuniversallyusedforplates,pins,screws,etc.They
are considered to have the required strength and rigid-
ity together with sufﬁcient corrosion resistance. Gen-erally, these ﬁxtures are considered temporary untilthe bone has joined after which they are removed. Themain reasonfor thisisthatthe veryrigiditywithwhichthe bone is held to allow healing will eventually leadto progressive weakening of the bone structure.
The biological structure of bone is reproduced in
Figure 13.4. In material science terms, the apparentcomplexity of bone can be described as a compositemade up of a matrix of collagen (polymer) reinforcedwith approximately 50% volume fraction of hydroxy-
apatite (ceramic) nanometre-scale crystals. Most bones
are made of a porous cellular structure (cancellousbone) covered with a denser compact shell. The poros-ity and density of the cancellous bone varies withlocation in the body depending on the stress state inthat region.Low densityregionshave a relativelyopen
398Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
Figure 13.4 The hierarchy of structure in bone. At the molecular level a, polarized triple helix of tropocollagen molecules
assembles into a microﬁbril b, with small gaps between the ends of the molecules into which small (5 by 30 nm) crystals of
hydroxyapatite later form. These microﬁbrils assemble into larger ﬁbrils c, which then form the layers in the osteon ( d—part
cut away to show the alternating orientation of ﬁbres in the annular layers). Osteons form in association with each other e,

cell structure and high density regions more closed.
The density determines the strength and stiffness ofthe bone which grows and develops to support thestress imposed on it. This may be uniaxial, whenthe cell walls will be oriented and thicker along this
direction, or more uniform when the cells are roughly
equiaxed.
Bone is not a static entity but dynamic in nature,
continually undergoing remodelling where ‘old’ boneis resorbed and replaced by new bone. Various factorscontrol the process but extremely important in stim-ulating the bone-producing cells (osteoblasts) is the
application of stress. In bone, the mineral phosphate
material is slowly dissolved and resorbed by the bodyand when subjected to normal stress is replenished bynew bone material synthesized by the osteoblasts. Thisrecycling process ensures a healthy, strong bone struc-ture with ageing. Bones for which the major stress is
carried by metal implants do not show the same ten-
dency for replenishment so that the bone surroundingthe implant is resorbed without replenishment lead-ing to a loosening of the implant. A rigid metal plateattached to a bone that has healed will neverthelesscarry the majority of the load. To avoid this ‘stressshielding’leadingtoboneweaknessitisrecommended
that the surgeon removes the holding plates soon after
the fracture has healed.
With the aim of trying to avoid the removal oper-
ation, alternative approaches are being consideredfor bone plates, screws, etc., including the use ofbiodegradable, or resorbable, materials such as poly-mers or composites which could be resorbed into thesurroundingtissueordissolvecompletelyoveraperiod
of time after the fracture has healed. However, thecombination of strength, ductility, toughness, rigidityand corrosion resistance of metals is hard to matchwith the non-metallics.
The large difference in elastic modulus between
competing biomaterials and bone (see Table 13.2) isevident. Of the various metals, titanium and its alloysare clearly the most suitable and are being increasinglyused. Titanium does, however, have a tribologicalweakness but the application of coatings and surfaceengineering is being increasingly adopted to overcomethis problem.
13.5 Replacement joints
13.5.1 Hip joints
The basic design of an artiﬁcial hip joint includesan alloy femoral stem, with a metallic or ceramicfemoral head moving in an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cup, asshown in Figures 13.1 and 13.5. The average life ofthe joint is better than 10 years but implants tend toloosen as a result of bone resorption due to modulusmismatch. Friction and wear also cause wear debrisbetween the cancellous, i.e. more porous, bone and thecup and also between the femoral head and the softer
UHMWPE.Overallthefailurerateisnowabout1–2%
per year, as shown in Figure 13.6.
Biomaterials 399

steel and UHMWPE acetabular cup (courtesy R. Grimer,Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham). (b) Modular
artiﬁcal hip made of titanium stem, alumina head and
UHMWPE acetabular cup (courtesy P. Marquis, Dental
School, Birmingham) .
Friction and wear problems are being improved
by using ultra-hard materials as the bearing mate-rial. A good resistance to frictional wear togetherwith biocompatibility makes alumina well suited forthe femoral head. Unfortunately, Al
2O3has a low
impact strength and is liable to failure when subjectedto stresses introduced by extra activity, e.g. jumping.Research has also shown that ion implantation of the
UHMWPE in a nitrogen atmosphere at 10
/NUL5mbar at
80 keV to a dose of 1 ð1017ions cm/NUL2reduces the
wear behaviour to virtually zero. The enchanced sur-
face properties together with higher hardness and elas-
tic moduli would very much improve the interactionproblems. A compromise solutionis to have a titaniumstem with stainless steel head coated with a thin layerof ceramic.
The problem of loosening of the joint due to bone
resorption is being tackled by the second generationof biomaterials and implants which mimic the body’stissues. One such material developed by ProfessorBonﬁeld and his colleagues at Queen Mary and West-ﬁeld College is a composite of hydroxyapatite (HA)in high-density polyethylene. The HA provides the
strengthening and stiffness reinforcement to the toughpolyethylenematrix. HAPEX,asitiscalled,isbiocom-
patible and bioactive, encouraging bone growth onto
the implant material which, of course, contains HA.
The biological response has been demonstrated by cellculture studies with human oesteoblasts in which thecells grew and spread over the composite initiated at
the HA particles. In vivotesting has shown a stable
interface between the implant and bone.
13.5.2 Shoulder joints
These joints, like hip joints, are increasingly beingreplaced by metal prostheses (Figure 13.7). Initially,similar principles were applied to shoulder joints as
to hip joints, using a stainless steel ball and socket
with polyethylene cup. However, because it is not aload-bearing joint the trend in shoulder replacement issimply to resurface the worn part on the humeris side
with a stainless steel cap rather than replace both sides
of the joint.
13.5.3 Knee joints
Total knee replacements (TKR) are increasingly beingmade to give pain-free improved leg function to many
thousands of patients suffering from osteoarthritis, or
rheumatoid arthritis. As with hip replacements, TKRinvolves removing the articulating surfaces of theaffected knee joint and replacing them with artiﬁcial
components made from biomaterials. Such operations
have a successful history and a failure rate of less than2% per year (Figure 13.6). A typical replacement jointconsists of a tibial base plate or tray, usually made of
stainless steel, Co–Cr, or titanium alloy, with a tibial
insert (UHMWPE) that acts as the bearing surface (seeFigure 13.8). The femoral component largely takes theshape of a natural femoral condyle made from the
above alloys, and articulates with the bearing surface,
together with the knee cap or patella. The patella maybe all polyethylene or metal backed. The componentsare either ﬁxed by cement or uncemented. Cemented
components use acrylic cement (polymethyl methacry-
late). Uncemented components rely on bone ingrowthinto the implant. Titanium used on its own shows evi-dence of bone ingrowth, but more recently this has
been improved by use of hydroxyapatite (HA) coat-
ing. Problems include wear debris from the PTFE andpossible fracture of the component.

loading, or increased physical activity, and possiblybone resorption.

ﬂexibility required through large angles while main-
taining overall stability. Early designs were based on

of fatigue and/or corrosion. Nowadays silicone rub-ber is more commonly used, showing little tendencyto fatigue failure while being biocompatible with anability to absorb lipids and fatty acids.
Polysiloxane is used in hand surgery to form a
‘tunnel’to allow transplanted tendons to slide back
and forward. It is also used to replace carpal bones.
It is, however, not suitable for longer joints or bonesunless reinforced.

Themanydifferentbiomaterialsusedinplasticsurgeryinclude collagen, silicone (polydimethylsiloxane),Teﬂon, polyethylene, Dacronand polyglocolic acid.
Polysiloxanes are widely used in reconstructive plasticsurgery because of their lack of any tissue reactivity,mechanical properties and structure. Polysiloxane may

In applications where strength is also required, steelwire reinforcement is necessary. The material is usednot only for implants but also for explants where itis moulded to ﬁt a speciﬁc shape, coloured to give a

examples are ear prosthesis or facial reconstructionafter loss due to injury or cancer surgery. Siliconemammary implants are now widely used for cosmetic

have an outer shell with the appropriate shape and
resilience covering an inner volume of silicone gel.
In these reconstructions Dacronmay be used as a
lining for the ear and as a backing in a breast implant
to provide a better fastening of the implant to the
surrounding tissue.
13.6.2 Maxillofacial surgery
Disease or injury to the oral and facial area may berepaired by implants from a range of biomaterials.Often the effective prostheses can improve the conﬁ-
dence and well-being of the patient beyond the imme-
diatefunctionalrepair.Thejaw,andjawbonearea,can
utilize many of the metal implants already discussed.
Commercially pure titanium in perforated sheet form
has been used because of its biocompatibility and ease
of manipulation and ﬁxing.
Polymers, particularly silicones and polyurethanes,
may be used to replace ﬂexible tissues of the nose,
cheek and ear regions of the face. Polysiloxanes have
been used for onlays in the area of the molar bone in

the lateral side of the mandible or over the forehead to
smooth it. Reinforced with stainless steel wires they
can also replace the mandible. A porous compositeof polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) strengthened with
carbon ﬁbres may be used to replace damaged bone
structures. Both PTFE and carbon are biocompatibleand ﬁbrous tissue growth into the pores ensures bond-
ing of the artiﬁcial and natural bone. Composites of
hydroxyapatite in a polyethylene matrix HAPEXhave
been used for patients who had either fractured theorbital ﬂoor supporting the eye or had lost an eye. A
great advantage of such material implants is that they
can be shaped during the operation and inserted onthe base of the eye socket and bonded ﬁrmly to the
supporting bone.
13.6.3 Ear implants
HAPEXhas been also used successfully for other clin-
ical replacements, mainly middle-ear implants. These
transmit sound from the outer to inner ear where thevibrations are translated into electrical signals to be
processed by the brain. Middle-ear malfunction can
lead to deafness (conduction deafness) which maybe cured by implant surgery. Otosclerosis (middle-ear
deafness) may result from ﬁbrosis of the middle ear
caused by repeated infections or from an hereditarydisease. A stapedectomy removes a small amount ofbone and immobilized tissue and replaces it with bio-
material. The implant has a hydroxyapatite head on a
HAPEX shaft which can be trimmed and shaped in
the operating theatre using an ordinary scalpel to ﬁt
the individual patient.
13.7 Biomaterials for heart repair
13.7.1 Heart valves
Heart disease is one of the major killers in the devel-
oped world. Many of the serious conditions arise from
the strain imposed on the heart by obstructions to the
ﬂow of blood either in the main passages of the cir-culatory system or as a result of valvular disease. The
heartactsasabloodpumpwithfourvalveswhichopen
in response to a unidirectional ﬂow of blood. Two ofthe valves allow the blood into the heart and the othertwo control the blood leaving the heart. Problems can
arise with the heart valves if they become structurally
damaged by disease affecting the opening and closingmechanisms.
The early prostheses developed in the 1960s for
valve replacement were based on a stainless steel ball-in-cage or polysiloxane ball in a Co–Cr alloy cage
(see Figure 13.9). These restrict the blood ﬂow, even
in the open position, and were superseded by a tilt-ing disc device which opens and closes to the beatof the heart to allow the required blood ﬂow. The
major problem with valves arose from the tendency
to initiate a blood clot and thus it was found necessaryto give valve recipients anticoagulant drugs. Nowa-
days, advanced valves are made with Co–Cr or tita-nium bodies with metal or graphite discs, or occluders,
coated with pyrolytic carbon. These coatings are made
by heating a hydrocarbon, such as methane, to about
1500
°C depositing the carbon vapour on the graphite
surface to a thickness of about 1 mm. Small amountsof silane mixed with the CH
4adds Si to the deposit,
increasing its strength. Pyrolytic carbon is strong and
wear resistant but, more importantly, resists the forma-
tionofbloodclotsonitssurface.Thediscsareattached
by a coated Timetal arm to a fabric ring made of poly-mer (PTFE) which is sewn to the tissue of the heart
valve opening. Dacroncloth has also been used and
encourages tissue growth with better anchorage and
thromboembolic resistance.
The prosthesis has moving parts and thus catas-
trophic failure by fracture is a ﬁnite possibility. As an
alternative, the construction of artiﬁcial valves frombiological tissue has been developed. Collageneous

a reduced risk of thrombosis. Unfortunately two prob-
lems have hindered this development. The ﬁrst is that
the collagen valve material suffers from slow calci ﬁ-
cation whereby hard deposits form on the surface of
the valves causing them to stick and tear. The use ofanticalciﬁcation drugs are a possibility but the second
problem has thrown the whole area of implant surgery
usinganimal tissueindoubt.Thisproblemistheemer-
gence of BSE (mad cow disease) in cattle, which has
led to restrictions and worries in the use of animal tis-sue for reconstructive implant surgery because of the
fear of transmission of viral illness from animal tissue
to humans.
13.7.2 Pacemakers
Other developments in improving heart performance
include the use of cardiac pacemakers which produces
a 5V electrical impulse for 1/500 second at regularheartbeat rate. These devices have been available for
some time but have improved signi ﬁcantly over recent
years. The basic requirement is to provide electrical
signals to the heart at the appropriate level to stim-
ulate the patient ’s own electrical activity to produce
the proper physiological change, normally linking the
pacemaker into the cardiac system so that it works
when needed. The biomaterial aspects of the pace-maker are, however, also important, not only in over-
coming the problems introduced by any device/body
environmental interaction, but also in designing the
proper electrical supply and insulation. Power sup-
plies have advanced considerably in the last few yearsand lithium cells are now exclusively used. Titanium
is again the most common biomaterial to encase the
device,manufacturedandelectronbeamweldedtoseal
it hermetically. Polymers have been used for encapsu-
lation, e.g. epoxy resin or silicone rubber but thesematerials do not completely prevent moisture from
entering the pacemaker and shortening the lifetime
of the device. These have now been superseded bytitanium alloys because of their better strength and
environmental properties. These are sutured into the
aorta with a Dacronsleeve.
Another problem area is that provided by the elec-
trodes which have to ﬂex with every heartbeat and
hence are liable to fatigue failure (see Chapter 7).
Good design and choice of electrode materials can
minimize this problem. The electrical supply passes
through the titanium casing via a ceramic insulator
and the leads to the heart are insulated with a poly-mer (polyetherurethane). Degradation with time is still
a possibility and has to be considered in an effective
design.
13.7.3 Artiﬁcial arteries
In branches of surgery, particularly cardiovascular
surgery, there is often a need to replace arteries
blocked by atherosclerosis. Sometimes this can be
achieved by using tissue grafts from the patients,
thereby avoiding any immune response. In other casesit is necessary to use arti ﬁcial arteries made from poly-
mers; such arteries must be tough and ﬂexible enough
to avoid kinking, with the added requirement of avoid-ing the formation of blood clots. In modern surgery,the blood clotting tendency can be removed by anti-coagulants, such as heparin, but the ultimate goal is toprovide arti ﬁcial arteries with natural clot resistance.
Several different polymers have been used to makeblood vessels but none is entirely satisfactory.
The polyester Dacron, can make small tubes but
these have porous walls which have to be sealed. Thisis achieved by treating with the protein albumin andheatingittoformacoagulatedcoating.Inthebody,thealbumindegradesandisreplacedbythenaturalproteincollagen forming a smooth lining (pseudointima). Thisprocess leads to some initial in ﬂammation which is
one disadvantage of this biomaterial. Woven Dacron
is quite rigid and unsuitable for small arteries and isdifﬁcult to suture; it is mostly used for resected aortic
aneurysms. Knitted Dacronis easier to suture. It may
be coated with polyurethane, tetra ﬂuoroethylene, or
heparin to reduce the thrombogenic tendency. The useof poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate) coatingestablishesan endothelial-like cell layer in a few weeks.
Other arterial polymers include PTFE and polyure-
thanes. PTFE is used as an expanded foam to formthe porous tubes. These rapidly develop a smoothneointima layer and thus acquire blood compatibility.Polyurethanes have a natural compatibility withblood and are tough and ﬂexible in tube form but
unfortunately slowly degrade in the body producingtoxic products. PTFE coatings on polyester and
polyurethane vessels have also been tried. Silicone-
lined tubing has been used for extra-corporealcirculation during open-heart surgery.
To produce arti ﬁcial arteries with built-in clot resis-
tance, heparin molecules have been attached to theirsurface either directly by chemical bonds or by cross-linking to form a polymerized heparin ﬁlm. To mimic
total thrombosis resistance, however, requires not only
anticoagulation but also avoidance of platelet deposi-
tion normally achieved by the endothelial cells liningthe blood vessel releasing the protein prostacyclin.Ideal artiﬁcial arteries should have both of these anti-
clotting agents attached at their surface.
13.8 Tissue repair and growth
Tissuesincludeskin,tendons,ligamentsandcartilages.Skin has the dual property of keeping the body ﬂuids
in while allowing the outward movement of moisturethrough a porous membrane, which is important incooling and maintaining the body temperature. Skinalso protects against infections, such as bacteria but isnot, of course, particularly strong. It is made up of lay-
ers including an outer epidermis and an inner dermis,
a dense network of nerve and bloodvessels. It is there-forevirtuallyimpossibletomakeanarti ﬁcialskinfrom
biomaterials to match this complexity. Nevertheless
404Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
skinreplacementshavebeenmadefrom polymerswith
an open structure which provides a basic framework
onto which real skin is able to grow. Moreover, with abiodegradable polymer the framework degrades as thenew tissue regrows. The porous ﬁlm can be coated
with silicone rubber to provide infection protectionand retain ﬂuids while the skin grows. When sutured
in place, tissue-forming cells ( ﬁbroblasts) migrate into
the porous polymer framework to generate new skin
layers. For severe burns, arti ﬁcial skin can be made
by growing epidermal skin cells within a biodegrad-able collagen mesh in a culture medium. The syn-thetic skin can then be grafted onto the patient. Otherbiodegradable products include the copolymers lacticacid–glycolic acid and lysine –lactic acid. The adhe-
sion of the polymer framework can be improved by
incorporating an adhesive protein ﬁbronectin.
Other tissues such as ligaments and cartilages are
largely elastic ﬁlaments of ﬁbrous proteins. Synthetic
substitutes have included Dacronpolyesters, PTFE
ﬁbresandpyrolyzedcarbon ﬁbres,withmixedsuccess.
Theﬁbres may be coated with polylactic acid polymer
which breaks down in the body to be replaced by col-lagen. At this stage such techniques are relatively new
but it does suggest that in future the growth of cells in
a culture vessel may possibly supply complex bioma-terials for various implanted functions. This approachis termed tissue engineering and together with biomet-rics, i.e. the mimicking of the working of biologicalsystems, offers a way of producing materials whichtotally synergize with the human body.
13.9 Other surgical applications
Polymers are used in a wide variety of surgical appli-cations. Polyurethane has good tissue and blood con-tact properties and is used in both short-term applica-tions, e.g. catheters, endotracteal tubes, vascular tub-ing, haemodialysis parts, and long-term applications,
e.g. heart-assist devices. Dacronis used in composite
form with a poly(2-hyroxyethyl methacrylate) matrixfor orthopaedic tendon reconstruction. Varying thecomposite mix can alter the properties to match therequirements. Reinforced, Dacronfabric is used for
reconstructingthe trachea and, in woven Dacronform,
for small bowel repair or replacement. It is also usedin the genitourinary systems, in mesh form in repair-
ing hernias and abdominal wall defects. Polysiloxanes
are used in neurological surgery, e.g. in valves to drainﬂuidsproducedintercraniallyandalsoastubestodrain
other canals such as the middle ear. Not having aporous structure, these tubes resist bacterial contam-ination.
Shape–memory–effect(SME)alloys(seeChapter 9,
section 9.6.4), particularly Ni –Ti, have been used
in several biomedical applications because of their
unique behaviour and for their biocompatibility. Inorthopaedics, for example, pre-stressed fracture boneplates can be made to shrink on heating to provide arigid, compressiveload ﬁxing.By contrast, Ni –Tirods
canbeprogrammedtoprovidetractiononlocalheating.In other applications Ni –Ti has been used in arti ﬁcial
heart muscles, teeth-straightening devices, intrauterinecontraceptive devices and as a ﬁlter in the vena cava
(inserted cold the ﬁlter opens its mesh at the temper-
ature of the deoxygenated blood ﬂowing back to the
heart).
Inspinalsurgery,commercially puretitaniumcables
and screws have been used for the correction of sco-liosis by gradual tightening of the cable to straightenthe spine. A big advantage of Ti for these devices isits resistance to crevice corrosion.
13.10 Ophthalmics
The main usage of biomaterials in ophthalmics is forhard contact lenses, soft contact lenses, disposablecontact lenses and arti ﬁcial interocular lenses. Apart
from being easier to wear soft contact lenses have
several advantages over hard lenses. Soft lenses ride
on a thinner tear ﬁlmﬁtting closer to the shape of
the cornea generally giving better corneal health, lessirritation from dust under the lens and less likelihoodof being dislodged.
For satisfactory lens performance the biomaterial
must be inert, dimensionally stable to retain its optical
properties,havealowdensity( ¾1g cm
/NUL3),arefractive
index close to that of the cornea (1.37) and good oxy-gen permeability to maintain a healthy cornea. Hardcontact lenses ﬁrst became available using PMMA
because it was light (density 1 .19g cm
/NUL3), easy to
shape, has a refractive index of 1.49 and is reasonablybiocompatible. They are, however, dif ﬁcult to wear for
long periods because PMMA is (i) hydrophobic andnot easily wetted by eye ﬂuids and (ii) has a very low
oxygenpermeability.Thesehavenowbeensupersededby soft lenses.
A wide variety of materials have been used for soft
lenses including silicones, hydroxyethyl methacrylate(HEMA) and copolymers with HEMA as the majorcomponent and vinyl pyrrolidine to increase the watercontent. Most soft lenses are made from hydrogels;poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) is still the mostpopular, containing a small amount of ethylene glycoldimethacrylate to act as a cross-linking agent. Thesehydrogel materials have excellent compatibility andother propertiesbuteven withgoodoxygenpermeabil-
ity (100 times better than PMMA) additional oxygen
transplant via tear exchange is necessary. To increasethe permeability the water content of the lens is raisedbut too high a water content can result in reducedstrength and poor handleability.
After cataract surgery and removal, polysiloxane
coated with wetting agents such as polyvinyl pyrro-lidine (PVP) has been used. For intraocular problems,silicone injectable has been used.

13.11 Drug delivery systems
Oral administration of tablets is a familiar method
for taking medicine. Less familiar is regular injection.
Both methods have many disadvantages not least ofwhich is that the drug is being used as a general bodymedicine when, ideally, it is required only at somespeciﬁc site in the body. A second disadvantage is the
variation in drug level with time, as it is metabolized
fromahightoaninsigni ﬁcantrateratherthanasteady,
more moderate rate. Nowadays, these disadvantagesare being addressed by developing controlled drug
delivery; in some cases to speci ﬁed tissues or organs.
One form of controlled drug delivery and targeting
system uses polymeric biomaterial to contain the drugwhich then escapes by diffusion. The diffusion path-
waythroughthepolymerisprovidedbythegapsinthe
chain-like structure which may be varied to control therelease rate. One such release system uses a copoly-mer of lactic and glycolic acids to target peptide-baseddrugstoreduceprostatecancer.Anotherapproachuses

tobloodchemistrylevels, suchas therelease ofinsulinin response to glucose level and has been used withsome success. The implanted micro-infusion systemconsists of a titanium reservoir of insulin together with
a micro-pump which delivers the insulin via a ﬁne
catheter. In principle, a glucose sensor could provide
a feedback control to the reservoir to complete the
creation of an arti ﬁcial pancreas.

Materials for sports
14.1 The revolution in sports
products
Within a relatively short period of time, say one gen-
eration, sport has come into remarkable worldwide
prominence; in the wake of this phenomenon, inno-
vative and highly specialized industries have emerged.Athletic sports, irrespective of the particular form ofcompetition, involve the application and transmissionof force and the expenditure of energy and, as a natu-
ral consequence, one of the attendant trends is to take
advantage of the latest developments in materials sci-ence and engineering and to use the latest generationof new materials for sporting artefacts such as rackets,golfclubs,skis,vaulting-poles,etc.Fortuitously,paral-
lel long-term activities in laboratories of the aerospace
industries, among others, have helped to provide andsustain a basic armoury of versatile new materials: it isnow generally appreciated by the viewing public thatthese materials have sport-transforming capabilities.
(Indeed, their introduction has sometimes led to urgent
reappraisal of the rule book.) With their aid, a humancan kick, throw or strike a ball farther, cleave air orwater at greater speed and, in the event of the occa-sionalmishap,survivewithlessriskofpersonal injury.
In some sports, traditional materials hold sway and
there are few material changes. In others, new materi-alsanddesignsappearwithbewilderingrapidity,beingdriven by the competitive spirit of the sports equip-mentindustryandcompetitorsalike.Withthisdynamic
background in mind, we have emphasized principles
wherever possible. Also, rather than attempting toencompasssportssuchasautomobileandyachtracing,which involve extremely large ﬁnancial outlays, wehave focused upon the more individual sports; that is,
upon sports which engage both professional and ama-
teur and which are essentially personal and physical.Thisrestrictionstillleavesan extremelybroadarena ofsporting activity, so we have concentrated on certainitems of sports equipment which provide an insightinto the processes of engineering design and manufac-
ture; topics include a revolutionary polymer-moulding
technique (tennis racket), bending stiffness and ﬂexure
(golf club), energy storage and transfer (archery bow),
joining problems (bicycle frames), duplex steel com-
posites (fencing foils), durability at low temperatures(snowboard bindings) and shock absorption (safety
helmets). The vital interplay between structure and
properties will be self-evident. Time and time again,
ultimate commercial success has depended upon a pre-
cise identiﬁcation of crucial material properties duringthe design and development stage.
As a preliminary, we have taken this opportunity to
describe the structure and properties of wood. Wood
provides a benchmark for alternative materials in sport
andmany mimic itscellularstructure.Inthemore gen-
eral context of engineering materials, wood remains
extremely important in tonnage and particularly volu-metric terms. Wood has always been, and remains, the
most widely used material for construction; arguably,
it should appear in any preliminary list of candidate
materials for any engineering design project.
14.2 The tradition of using wood
Wood is a biopolymeric composite. Large long-chain
molecules of cellulose comprise about 50–60% of thestructure and form hollow, elongated cells (tracheids).
The principal orientation of tracheids is parallel to the
axis of the trunk, giving wood its well-known grain.
Typically, these ﬂuid-conveying cells are 0.5–5 mm
long and have an aspect ratio of 100:1. In temperatezones of climate, new layers of cells grow beneath the
bark during spring (large cells, thin walls) and summer
(small cells, thick walls). Other, more elongated cells,
knownasraycells,formatrightanglestothetracheids
and carry ﬂuids transversely across the trunk. Growth
ceases during winter, giving rise to the visible ‘growth
rings’ in the trunk’s cross-section. Sap diffuses upthe outer annulus of sapwood while the heartwood
Materials for sports 407
provides a supportive core. According to botanical
classiﬁcation, broad-leaved trees provide hardwoods
(ash, oak, elm, maple, balsa, etc.) and coniferous trees
with needle-shaped leaves provide softwoods (pine,
spruce, ﬁr, etc.).
Differences in the wall structure, shape and size
of the cells are responsible for the many differenttypes of wood. Within the strong and elastic wall of
each tracheid, different types of layers of cellulose
microﬁbrils have been identiﬁed (Figure 14.1). In the
primary (P)layer,microﬁbrilsarerandomlyorientated.
In the three secondary (S) layers, microﬁbril orienta-tion varies from layer to layer. Thus, in the thick, mid-
dle S2 layer, the alignment of microﬁbrils at a slight
angletothemajoraxisofthecellismainlyresponsible
for the high tensile strength along the grain. The cells
are cemented together, between their primary walls,by a non-crystalline phase which is rich in lignin. This
middle lamina (ML) is weaker than the cellulose lay-
ers. The overall density of wood depends upon cell
structure, the ratio of dense lignin to cellulose and
the amount of water absorbed. Moisture modiﬁes the
layer structure of the cell walls and thereby drastically
reduces strength and elasticity.
Because of the ﬁbrous, highly anisotropic structure
of wood, control of dimensional stability is a potential
problem. Typically, coefﬁcients of thermal expansion
for tangential, radial and longitudinal directions in a
tree trunk are in the order of 70 ð10
/NUL6,5 0ð10/NUL6and
3ð10/NUL6°C/NUL1, respectively. When felled, timber can

moisture. As moisture is lost from within cells andfrom their walls during either air drying or kiln dry-ing, shrinkage occurs. Dimensional stability in serviceis achieved by aiming for an equilibrium between themoisture content of the wood and atmospheric humid-
ity. Thus, 10% moisture content (kiln dried) might be
speciﬁed for wood used in a centrally heated build-ing whereas 20% moisture (air dried) might be moreappropriate for outdoor service.
The mechanical strength of wood increases roughly
in proportion to density. Longitudinal tensile strength
with the grain is usually several times greater than ten-
sile strength across the grain: speciﬁc tensile strengthis generally excellent and comparable to that of mildsteel. Compressive stress along the grain can causethe ﬁbrous structure to buckle: compressive strength is
therefore not exceptional. In the composite known as
plywood, thin layers of wood are glued together withadjacent grains crossed, giving uniformity of strengthand minimizing shrinkage.
Continual stressing can cause structural creep of
wood; accordingly, archery bows are unstrung when
not in use. Wood has good fracture toughness, being
able to withstand the localized damage produced byscrews and nails. Although wood has often been dis-placed from its dominant role, certain sports still takeadvantage of its unique characteristics. The excellentdamping capacity of certain woods, together with their
elasticity, has long favoured their use for bats and
clubs, e.g. golf club heads, hockey sticks, ash hurleys,table tennis bats. A classic example was the choiceof supple blue willow ( Salix alba caerulea ), with its
thick-walled cell structure, for the English cricket bat.
14.3 Tennis rackets
14.3.1 Frames for tennis rackets
Rackets utilizing the latest engineering materials have
increased the capacity of the professional player to
make strokes over a remarkable range of pace andspin. At an amateur level, their introduction has madethe sport more accessible by providing a greater tol-erance for error and by easing beginners’ problems.For many years, hardwoods, such as ash, maple and
okume, were used in the laminated construction of
racket frames. The standard area was 70 in
2. Although
damping capacity was excellent, their temperature-and humidity-dependent behaviour could be awkward:wear and warping problems were commonly accepted.The introduction of tubular-section aluminium alloy
and steel frames in the 1960s enabled designers to
breakthroughthebarriersimposedbytheuseofwood,and tennis boomed. In the 1970s, ‘large-head’ rack-
ets of different shape with a larger area of 105 in
2
came into vogue. The greater stiffness and strength
enabled string tensions to be raised and the effective
playing area, the so-called ‘sweet spot’, was consider-ably increased. The ‘sweet spot’ is the central portion
408Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
of the stringed area where the vibrational nodes are
minimal, or zero, when the ball is struck. A mishit of
the ball outside this area generates undesirable vibra-
tions and, quite apart from spoiling the accuracy and
power of the subsequent shot, can cause the player to
developthepainfulanddebilitatingmuscularcondition
known as ‘tennis elbow’. Despite their merits, alloy
frames had insufﬁcient damping capacity and failed to
displace wooden frames.
In the next stage of evolution, during the 1970s,
composite frames were developed which used
polyester, epoxy or phenolic resin matrices in a
variety of combinations with continuous ﬁbres of E-glass, carbon and aramid ( Kevlar); although more
costly than alloy frames, they had better damping
capacity. ‘Mid-size’ composite rackets with a strung
area of 80–100 in
2came into favour. The generally
accepted manufacturing method was to lay-up the
continuous ﬁbres in a frame mould, surround themwith thermosetting resin, compression mould, cure,
surface ﬁnish and drill string holes.
These ‘conventional’ composite frames were costly
to produce and used material that was twice as dense
as a laminated wood frame. In 1980, the world market
in tennis rackets was 55% wood, 30% composite and
15% metal. In the same year, injection moulding of
hollow ‘mid-size’ frames (Figure 14.2) was pioneered
(Haineset al., 1983). This method directly challenged
the‘conventional’manufacturingrouteforcomposites.
In the original patented process, a composite mix of
30% v/v short carbon ﬁbres (PAN) and polyamide
thermoplastic (nylon 66) was injected into a complexframe mould carrying an accurately located central
core. (Rheological studies have shown that, at high
shear rates, the viscosity of the ﬁbre-laden mixtureis not greatly different from that of thermoplastic
alone.) The fusible core was made of Bi–Sn alloy,m.p. 138 .5
°C, some 130 °C lower than the melting
point of the polymeric matrix phase. (Being thermally
conductive, the core acted as a heatsink and remainedintact.) The core was slowly melted out in an oil bath
⊿150
°C/triangleleftandlaterreused,leavingacentralcavityinthe
frame which could be ﬁlled with vibration-damping,
low-density polyurethane foam. (The melt-out process
also had the beneﬁcial effect of relieving stresses intheframe.) The mould/coredesignallowedtheﬂowing
composite to form strong tubular pillars in the frame
through which the strings could be threaded. The wallthickness of the frame was 2.5 mm. The cycle time for
core preparation, injection moulding and core melt-out
was only 3 minutes per frame. The balanced handlewas given a leather grip and ﬁlled with medium-
density polyurethane foam. Injection-moulded frames
of this type, using a short-ﬁbre composite, were much
stronger than laminated wood frames and as strong
as, often strongerthan, ‘conventional’continuous-ﬁbre

dence, much study and debate. It is contended thatsome ready-strung rackets, as purchased, are alreadyslack.
Ox-gut, the traditional string material, is very effec-
tive. However, a greater rebound velocity can beimparted to the ball by using synthetic materials ofhigher elastic modulus, such as nylon. Each nylonstring, typically 1.3 mm diameter, is a braid composedof plaited and intertwined bundles of strong ﬁbres.
After immersion in an elastomeric solution, the stringisgivenapolymericcoatingtoprotectitfrommoistureand wear. Rebound velocity is, of course, also directlyinﬂuenced by string tension, which, depending upon
racket type and personal preference, can range from aforce of 200 N to more than 300 N. Another promis-ingmaterialforstrings,initiallysuppliedintheformofyarn (Zyex, Victrex ), is polyether-etherketone (PEEK).
14.4 Golf clubs
14.4.1 Kinetic aspects of a golf stroke
Considertheviolentbuteventfulhistoryofaneffective
drive with a golf club (Horwood, 1994). Figure 14.3shows how the bending moment of the shaft varieswith time during the 2 second period of the stroke. (Abendingmoment of 1 N m is equivalentto a de ﬂection
of about 13 mm at the end of the shaft.) In thisparticular test, toward the end of its downward swingand prior to impact, the shaft de ﬂected backwards and
then forwards, the club head reaching a swing speed
at impact of 42.5 m s
/NUL1(95 miles h/NUL1). The period
of contact between head and ball was approximately0.5 ms. After a well-executed stroke, the driven golfball, aided aerodynamically by its surface dimples, iscapable of travelling a distance of some 220 –240 m.
The shaft of a club bends and twists elastically during
the complete swing and, after impact, vibrations travelat the speed of sound along the shaft toward the
grip. The much-quoted ‘feel’of a club tends to be a
highly subjective judgement; for instance, in additionto transmitted vibrations, it usually takes into especialaccount the sound heard after the instant of impact.
A mishit occurs if the striking face of the head is
imperfectly aligned, horizontally and vertically, withthe ball; a fair proportion of drives fall into thiscategory. The desired ‘sweet spot ’of impact lies at the
point where a line projected from the centre of gravity
of the head meets the striking face perpendicularly.Off-centre impact (outside the ‘sweet spot ’) rotates the
large head of a ‘wood’about its centre of gravity,
causing the ball to either hook sidespin (toed shot)or slice sidespin (heeled shot) in accordance with thewell-known ‘gear effect ’.
The intrinsicdif ﬁculties of achieving distance, accu-
racy and consistency have challenged golf players forcenturies and continue to do so. One bene ﬁcial effect
of the new materials recently adopted for club heads
and shafts has been to make this demanding sportaccessible to a wider range of player ability e.g. seniorcitizens. Despite golf being frequently described as a
triumph of art over science, concerted efforts are being
made to explain and rationalize its unique physicalaspects in engineering and scienti ﬁc terms (Cochran,
1994). Such research activities, which are commer-
cially stimulated, have led to the realization that many
phenomena attending the impact of club upon ball arestill imperfectly understood. One consequence is that,
at a practical level, equipment makers apply a variety
of testing methods that are often unco-ordinated andpotentially confusing: there appears to be a need for

to be established internationally.
14.4.2 Golf club shafts
The principal design parameters for a shaft are weight,bending stiffness, bend point and torsional stiffness.
For a given head weight, lightening the shaft reputedlymakes the swing faster and hence gives some increasein ball speed and distance. Figure 14.3 has already
indicated the violent forward and backward bending
that occurs in the plane of swing during a drive.Professional golfers and players with a rapid, compact
swing favour very stiff shafts. The bend point (also
called the ﬂex point or kick point) of a shaft is
generally taken as the region where the minimum
radius of curvature occurs during bending. A butt-
ﬂexible shaft has a high bend point (near the grip) and
suits long hitters. Conversely, a tip- ﬂexible shaft has a
lowbendpoint(nearthehead)andsuitsweakerhitters.
A low bend point also increases the dynamic loft of
the struck ball. During a drive shot, the shaft tendsto twist a few degrees (as well as bend) because the
centre of gravity of the club head and the long axis of
the shaft are offset. Torsional stiffness (wrongly called‘torque’) helps the striking face to remain ‘square’
during impact. Long hitters tend to favour torsionally
stiff (‘low torque ’)s h a f t s .
A typical driver, total weight 350 g, comprises
a grip (50 g), steel shaft (100 g) and head (200 g).
A variety of materials, including alloy steel, alu-
minium alloy (7075), Ti –6Al–4V alloy and com-
posites, have been used for the hollow shafts. Car-bon,Kevlar, glass, boron and silicon carbide ﬁbres
have been used as ‘reinforcement ’in shaft compos-
ites. Both epoxy and alloy matrices have been usede.g. 7075 aluminium alloy C17%v/v short SiC ﬁbres.
The main advantages of hollow CFRP shafts, loosely
termed‘graphite’shafts, is their relative lightness
(about 60 g) and high damping capacity. They aremade by (i) wrapping prepreg sheets of carbon ﬁbre
around tapered mandrels, (ii) ﬁlament winding around
a mandrel or (iii) resin transfer moulding (RTM) inwhich resin is forced around a carbon ﬁbre sleeve.
Reproducing exactly the same bending characteristics
from shaft to shaft is a dif ﬁcult, labour-intensive task
and demands considerable care and skill. Quality was
not always assured with the early CFRP shafts. With
CFRP, torsional stiffness and the location of the bendpoint can be manipulated by varying the textural formand lay-up of the graphite ﬁlaments. In this respect,
steel shafts, which represent the principal competition
to the more recently introduced CFRP shafts, are morerestricted. However, they can match CFRP for speci ﬁc
stiffness and strength. Paradoxically, irons with ‘heavy
graphite’shafts are now available: addition of expen-
sive boron ﬁbres to the CFRP near the shaft tip allows
alighterclubheadtobeused.Theneteffectistoallow
the balance point of the club to be shifted 40 –50 mm
higher up the shaft and away from the club head. Thisdevice seeks to retain the desired damping capacity of
CFRP while giving an overall balance similar to that
of a steel shaft.
The main categories of golf club are (i) wood-
type clubs ( ‘woods’), comprising wooden ‘woods’
and metal ‘woods’, (ii) iron-type clubs ( ‘irons’)a n d
(iii) putters. Materials used for club heads rangefrom hardwoods to alloys (stainless steel, titanium
alloy, aluminium alloy, copper alloy) and composites
(CFRP). There has been a tendency for club heads toget larger and for shafts to get longer.
14.4.3 Wood-type club heads
‘Woods’have the bulkiest shape and the largest front
to back dimension. The traditional wooden ‘wood’
club heads, which are still highly regarded, are made
fromeitherpersimmon(date-plumtree)ormaple(lam-inated). These two hardwoods have similar cell struc-ture, density and hardness. Their capacity for damping
vibrations is excellent. Manufacture involves 120 –200
manualoperationsandisskilldemanding.Inaprelimi-nary curing process, the wood structure is impregnated
with linseed oil in order to make it waterproof and
hard. A striking face and a sole plate, both metal-lic, are inserted and a central cavity ﬁlled with cork.
The head is protectively coated with polyurethane and
ﬁnally weighs about 200 g. As with all club heads,
the principal design variables are size, shape, loca-tion of the centre of gravity and mass distribution. For
instance, the cork insert helps to displace mass to the
outside of the head to give some degree of ‘peripheral
weighting ’, a feature which reduces the twisting action
of off-centre shots i.e. outside the ‘sweet spot ’.
In the 1970s, metallic ‘woods’made from alloys
became available as drivers. Materials ranged fromstainless steel to the light alloys of aluminium and
titanium. Nowadays 17Cr –4Ni stainless steel is a pop-
ular choice. Compared to traditional wooden ‘woods’,
alloy heads are easier to make and repeatable qualityis more easily achieved, largely because of the intro-
duction of investment casting. In this modern version
of the ancient ‘lost wax’process, which is eminently
suitable for high m.p. alloys that cannot be diecast, a
thin refractory shell is formed around a wax pattern.
The wax is melted to leave a cavity which serves asa detailed mould for molten steel. The precision cast-
ings are welded to form a thin-walled, hollow shell.
The central cavity is usually ﬁlled with low-density
foam. Compared with wooden ‘woods’, the moment
of inertia is greater and the centre of gravity is located
closer to the striking face. The shell construction gives
peripheral weight distribution away from the centreof gravity of the head. In a recent design the cen-
tre of gravity has been lowered by locating dense
Cu/W inserts in the sole, e.g. Trimetal clubs. Over-
all, such innovative features confer a greater tolerancefor mishits. For instance, a greater moment of inertia
reduces twisting of the head when impact is off-centre
and also reduces spin.
Materials for sports 411
Composite ‘woods’ have been made from CFRP.
These heads, which emphasize lightness and strength,are similar in shape and style to classic wooden heads
andhaveasimilarplacingofthecentreofgravity.Typ-
ically, they have wear-resistant alloy sole plates and afoam-ﬁlled core. Compression moulding or injection
moulding are used in their manufacture.
14.4.4 Iron-type club heads
The relatively narrow heads for ‘irons’ are usually
made from steels and copper alloys which are shapedby either hot forging or investment casting. Stainless
materials include 17Cr–4Ni and AISI Types 431 and
304. As an alternative to the traditional blade-typehead,‘cavity-backirons’provideperipheralweighting.
In a recent innovation, a non-crystalline zirconium-
based alloy
2containing Cu, Ti, Ni and Be has been
used for the heads of irons (and putters). This alloy
has high speciﬁc strength and good damping capacity
and can be successfully vacuum cast in a glassy statewithout the need for ultra-fast freezing rates.
14.4.5 Putting heads
Although a set of golf clubs may only contain one
putter, it is typically used for 40–50% of the strokes
in a game. The dynamic demands are less than thosefor ‘woods’ and ‘irons’, consequently putter designs
have tended to be less innovative. Design parameters
include‘sweet spot’,weightdistribution,bendingstiff-ness, etc., as previously. Alloys used include stainless
steel (17Cr–4Ni), manganese ‘bronze’ (Cu–Zn–Mn)
and beryllium–copper (Cu–2Be).
14.5 Archery bows and arrows
14.5.1 The longbow
For centuries, archery bows have combined designskill with knowledge of material properties. Fromthe evidence of many well-preserved yew longbows
retrieved in 1982 from the wreck of the Tudor war-
ship‘Mary Rose’ , which sank in Portsmouth harbour
(1545), we know that the original seasoned stave was
shapedinsuchawayastolocatesapwoodontheouter
convex ‘back’ of the bow and darker heartwood at theconcave ‘belly’ surface. When the bow was braced
and drawn, this natural composite arrangement gave
the greatest resistance to the corresponding tensile andcompressive stresses. Considerable force, estimated to
beintheorderof36–72 kgf(80–160 lbf),wasneeded
2VitreloyorLiquidmetal , developed at Caltech, now
produced by Howmet Corp. Greenwich, CT-06830, USA.to draw a heavy longbow.3The mystique of the long-
bow and its near-optimum design have intrigued engi-neers and scientists; their studies have greatly helped
in providing a theoretical basis for modern designs of
bows and arrows (Blyth & Pratt, 1976).
14.5.2 Bow design
Abowanditsarrowsshouldbematchedtothestrength
and length of the archer’s arm. A well-designed bow
acts as a powerful spring and transfers stored strainenergy smoothly and efﬁciently to the arrow. As the
archer applies force and draws the bowstring from
the braced condition (which already stores energy)through a draw distance of about 35 cm, additional
energy is stored in the two limbs (arms) of the bow. In
general, increasingthelengthofthebowreducesstressand increases the potential for energy storage. Upon
release of the bowstring, stored energy accelerates the
arrow as well as the string and the two limbs of thebow. The efﬁciency ( /DC1) of the bow at the moment
of loose may be taken simply as the kinetic energy
of the arrow divided by work expended in drawingthe bow. Alternatively, allowance can be made for the
energy-absorbing movement of the two limbs, as in
the Klopsteg formula:
/DC1Dm/kCm⊿ 14.1/triangleleft
where mis the weightof the arrow and kis the ‘virtual
weight’ of the particular bow. The constant term k
treats energy losses in the bow as an extra burden on
the driven arrow, travelling with the same velocity.For a given bow and draw force, /DC1increases with
arrow mass. Thus, for a certain yew bow ⊿kD23.5g/triangleleft,
increasing the arrow weight from 23.5 g to 70.5 gincreased the efﬁciency of the bow from 50% to 75%.
Bow materials are often compared in terms of spe-
ciﬁc modulus of rupture and speciﬁc modulus of elas-ticity. Thus, for wooden bows, timbers which combine
ah i g hM o R / /SUBwith a comparatively low E//SUBare gen-
erallypreferredastheyprovidelightness,thenecessaryresistance to bending stresses and a capacity to store
energy. The ﬁne-grained hardwoods ash and wych elm
meet these criteria. Although nominally a softwood,yew was favoured for longbows, its very ﬁne grain
giving remarkable bending strength. Strain energy per
unit volume can be derived from the stress v. straindiagram and expressed as 0 .5ε
2E. It follows that max-
imizing strain ε(below the elastic limit) is an effective
way of maximizing stored energy.
There are two main types of modern bow, the stan-
dard recurve (Olympic) bow and the more complex
compound bow. In contrast to the D-section of the

shipwreck, indicate that a lifetime of drawing the longbowproduced permanent physical deformation. This powerfulweapon was developed in conﬂicts in the Welsh Marches;its ability to penetrate plate armour had both military andsocial signiﬁcance.

riser (Al–Mg–Si alloy 6082) (courtesy of Merlin Bows, Loughborough, U.K.) .
Tudor longbow, limb sections of a recurve bow are
wide, ﬂat and thin, giving resistance to twisting. Theenergy efﬁciency of a compound bow (Figure 14.4) is
twice that of the longbow and, as a consequence, can
propel an arrow much faster, at velocities of 90 m s
/NUL1
or more. Pulley cams at the ends of the two limbs sus-
tain the load at full draw during the sighting period
of 10 s or more. The most powerful compound bowsuse light alloys for the mid-section (‘riser’ or grip) e.g.forged Al alloy, diecast Mg alloy. Laminated wood isused for some bow grips, e.g. maple plus rosewood.
The two limbs are very often laminated in construction
and are much less susceptible to temperature changeandhumiditythanwoodalone.Manydifferentmaterialcombinations are used for laminae, e.g. CFRP, wood,
GRP, foam, etc. For instance, in one type of compos-
ite bow limb, facing and backing strips of GRP arejoined to each side of a thin core strip of maple withepoxy adhesive. Tubular alloy steel limbs have been
superseded as they were prone to internal aqueous cor-
rosion: sudden fracture of a drawn bow (or its string)can be extremely dangerous.
14.5.3 Arrow design
Successful discharge of an arrow from a bow involvesa careful balancing of three arrow characteristics;namely, length, mass and stiffness (‘spine’). Subse-
quent ﬂight depends on the aerodynamic qualities of
the design of head, shaft and ﬂetching. The length ofthe arrow is determined by the geometry of the humanbody; typically, lengths range from 71 to 76 cm. The
masschosendependsinitiallyuponthetypeofarchery,
e.g. maximum range, target shooting, etc. The prod-uct of efﬁciency ( /DC1) and stored energy ⊿E
s/triangleleftgives the
kinetic energy of the arrow, hence:
/DC1EsD0.5mv2
o ⊿14.2/triangleleft
where mDmass of the arrow and voDits initial
velocity. Thus velocity increases with bow efﬁciencyand decreasing arrow mass.Finally, an arrow must possess an optimum, rather
than maximum, stiffness (‘spine’) which must be
matchedtothebow.Bendingstiffnessofanarrowshaft
is measured in a three-point bend test (Figure 7.6).
Central to the design of an arrow is the phenomenon
known as the Archer’s Paradox (Figure 14.5). At the
loose, with the arrow pointing slightly away from the
target, the arrow is subjected to a sudden compressive
force along its length which, together with the deﬂect-
ing action of the archer’s ﬁngers, generates lateral
vibrations in the moving arrow. Correct matching of
the dimensions, stiffness and vibration characteristics
(frequency, amplitude) of the arrow enables the arrow
to clear the bow cleanly. In addition to dependence
on the arrow’s dimensions, the frequency of ﬂexu-
ral vibration is proportional to the square root of the
speciﬁc stiffness ⊿E//SUB/triangleleft. Frequencies are in the order
of 60 Hz. Reasonable agreement has been obtained
between theory and high-speed cin ´ephotographic stud-
ies.

Of the 15 kinds of wood used as arrows for long-
bows in medieval times, ash was generally regarded as
the best. Nowadays, arrowshafts are tubular and made
from (i) drawn and anodized aluminium alloy (7075-
T9, 7178-T9), (ii) similar alloys bonded to a smooth
outer wrap of unidirectional CFRP and (iii) pultruded
CFRP. (Early CFRP arrows were unpopular because
they tended to develop splintering damage.) Most
arrowshafts are constant in diameter along their length
but have the disadvantage that their bending moment
varies, increasing from zero at the ends to a maximum
at the centre. Tapering (‘barrelling’) the tubular shaft
from the middle to the ends reduces this undesirable
ﬂexing characteristic: barrelled arrows are used by topprofessionals.
Feathers are the traditional ﬂetching material and
still used but are fragile and suffer from the weather.
They rotate the arrow and give stability during ﬂight

made from polyethylene terephthalate ( Mylar)a r e
strong, weather resistant and, because of their lower
aerodynamic drag, give greater range; the same poly-
mer is also commonly used in stranded form ( Dacron)
for bowstrings.
14.6 Bicycles for sport
14.6.1 Frame design
The modern bicycle is a remarkable device for con-verting human energy into propulsion. The familiar
diamond frame, with its head, top, seat and down
tubes, evolved in the late nineteenth century. Whenin use, it distorts elastically; this compliance provides
rider comfort. Compliance absorbs energy and frame
stiffness is accordingly maximized in racing machines.The stress distribution in a working frame is complex,
being in-plane as well as out-of-plane. Sudden impact
stresses must be withstood. Poor design, workman-ship and/or maintenance can lead to component failure
which, because of the ﬂuctuating nature of stressing,
often has fatigue characteristics.
McMahon & Graham (1992) have provided a
detailed comparison of typical tube materials forframes. Beam theory is used to identify the key
design parameters. The basic linking formula which
expresses the stresses and strains at points along abeam deﬂecting under load is:
M/ID/ESC/yDE/r ⊿ 14.3/triangleleft
where MDbendingmoment, IDmomentofinertia
of beam section, /ESCDstress at a point, yDdistance
of point from neutral axis of beam, EDmodulus of
elasticity and rDradius of curvature of loaded beam.
In particular, we are concerned with (i) the maximumtensile stress /ESC
maxin the convex surface of a tube
subjected to a nominal bending moment and (ii) thecorresponding radius rof bending. Obviously, /ESC
max
should bear a good relation to the yield strength of the
material and rshould be maximized.
A tubular cross-section offers special advantages.
Within a bent beam, it locates as much material aspossibleinthehighlystressedregionswhichliedistantfrom the neutral axis: this axis lies in the plane mark-ing the transition from tension to compression. Beingsymmetrical in section, a tube can be loaded trans-versely in any direction and can withstand torsion. Its
moment of inertia is /EM⊿D
4/NULd4/triangleleft/64, where Dandd
aretheoutsideandinsidediametersofthetube,respec-tively. From relation (14.3) it can be seen that, for agivenbendingmoment, increasingthemoment ofiner-tia reduces stress and increases the radius of curvature.In similar fashion, it can be reasoned that reducing thetube wall thickness increases the surface stress ⊿/ESC
max/triangleleft.
Sometimes it is beneﬁcial to raise the moment of iner-tia by changing from a circular cross-section to a moreexpensive elliptical cross-section. Thus, in front wheelforks, which are subjected to severe bending stresses,an increase in themajor diameter of theellipsereducesstress in the crucial plane.
Table 14.1 compares the bending characteristics of
tubes made from four typical materials used for cycleframes; that is, from plain carbon steel, 0.3C–Cr–Moalloy steel (AlSl 4130), 6061 (T6) aluminium alloyand Ti–3Al –2.5V alloy. Calculated values for bendcurvature and maximum stress, which are the crite-ria of stiffness and permissible loading, are compared.The frames of mountain bicycles must sustain suddenimpact shocks;accordingly,larger-diameter ( D) and/or
thicker-walled tubing is used for certain frame mem-bersinordertoreducestresslevels.Thespeciﬁcelasticmoduli ⊿E//SUB/triangleleftfor the four materials are similar. Alu-
minium alloy offers weight saving but, because of its

14.6.2 Joining techniques for metallic frames
The above guidelines provide a general perspective
but do not allow for the potentially weakening effectof the thermal processes used for joining the ends
of individual frame tubes. Such joints often coincide
with the highest bending moments. In mass produc-tion,thecold-drawnlow-carbonsteeltubesofstandardbicycle frames are joined by brazing. Shaped rein-forcing sockets (lugs) of low–carbon steel, togetherwith thin inserts of solid brazing alloy, are placed
around the tube ends, suitably supported, and heated.
A 60Cu–40Zn alloy such as CZ7A (British Stan-dard 1845) freezes over the approximate temperaturerange of 900–870
°C as the frame cools and forms a
strong, sufﬁciently ductile mixture of ˛andˇphases
(Figure 3.20). Butted tubes are commonly used tocounteract softening of the steel in the heat-affected
zones (HAZ); they have a smaller inside diameter
(d) toward the tube ends. For limited production runs
of specialized racing frames made from butted alloytubes, ﬁllet brazing with an oxy-acetylene torch at alower temperature is more appropriate, using a silverbrazing alloy selected from the AG series of British
Standard 1845, such as 50Ag–15Cu–16Zn –19Cd
(melting range 620–640
°C). Cadmium-free alloys are
advocated if efﬁcient fume-extraction facilities are notavailable because CdO fumes are dangerous to health.
Tungsten-inert gas (TIG) welding
6is widely used
and has tended to replace brazing, e.g. lugless Cr–Mosteel frames for mountain bicycles. Unlike oxyacety-lene ﬂames, heating is intense and very localized. Thehardenability of Cr–Mo steels is such that a strong

temperatures above 850 °C. The latest type of low-
alloysteel for frames, available ineither cold-drawn or
heat-treated condition ( Reynolds 631 and853), is air
hardening. Although inherently very hard (400 VPN),
TIG-welding increases its hardness in the HAZ. It pos-
sesses better fatigue resistance than other alloy steels
and its strength/weight ratio makes it competitive with
Ti–3Al–2.5V alloy and composites.
Aluminium alloy tubes, which are solution treated
and artiﬁcially aged (T6 condition), present a problem
because heating during joining overages and softens
the structure, e.g. 6061, 7005. The high thermal con-
ductivity of aluminium worsens the problem. Titanium
alloys, such as the frame alloy Ti–3Al –2.5V, absorb
gases and become embrittled when heated in air, e.g.
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen. Again, it is essential to
prevent this absorption by shrouding the weld poolwith a ﬂowing atmosphere of inert gas (argon).
14.6.3 Frame assembly using epoxy adhesives
These joining problems encouraged a move toward
the use of epoxy adhesives with sleeved tube joints.7
As well as helping to eliminate the HAZ problem,
adhesives make it possible to construct hybrid frames
from various combinations of dissimilar materials
(adherends), including composites. Brake assembliescan be glued to CFRP forks. Adhesive bonds also
damp vibrations, save weight, reduce assembly costs
and are durable. Extremes of humidity and tempera-
ture can cause problems and care is essential during
adhesive selection. Adhesives technology meets the

The structural adhesives most widely used in gen-
eral engineering are the epoxy resins; their ther-
mosetting character has been described previously
(Section 2.7.3). Normally they are water resistant.Theyformstrongbondsbut,beinginaglassystate,arebrittle. Accordingly, thermoplastic and/or elastomericconstituents are sometimes included with the ther-
mosetting component. When using the two-part ver-
sion of a thermosetting adhesive, it is important tocontrol the proportions of basic resinous binder andcatalytic agent (hardener) exactly, to mix thoroughlyand to allow adequate time for curing. In single-partepoxy adhesives the resin and hardener are pre-mixed:
rapid curing is initiated by raising the temperature
above100
°C. Thermoplasticadhesives,usedalone, are
weaker, more heat sensitive and less creep resistant.Elastomeric adhesives, based on synthetic rubbers,are inherently weak. Meticulous preparation of the
adherend surfaces is essentialfor all types of adhesive.
14.6.4 Composite frames
Epoxy resins are also used to provide the
matrix phase in the hollow, composite frames of
high-performance bicycles. Carbon ﬁbre reinforced
polymers(Section 11.3.2.1)combinehighstrengthandstiffness; their introduction facilitated the constructionof monocoque (single shell) frames and led to theappearance of a remarkable generation of record-
breaking machines.
9Typically, they feature a daring
cantilevered seat, a disc rear wheel and three-spokeopen front wheels, all of which are made from CFRP.An example is depicted in Figure 14.6.
14.6.5 Bicycle wheels
Thefamiliararrayofwirespokesbetweenaxleandrimnormally uses hard-drawn wire of either plain 0.4%carbon steel (AISI 1040) or austenitic 18Cr–8Ni stain-
less steel (McMahon & Graham, 1992). Each spoke
is tangential to the axle, thus preventing ‘wind-up’displacement between axle and rim, and is elastically
pretensioned (e.g. 440 MN m
/NUL2)s ot h a ti ti sa l w a y si n
tension during service. During each wheel revolution,
the stress on a given spoke is mostly above the preten-
sion stress, falling once below it. Under these cyclicconditions, carbon steel has a greater nominal fatigueendurance than the corrosion-resistant 18/8 steel but

bonding and gap-ﬁlling functions with birchwood/balsa
composites and spruce airframes e.g. De HavillandMosquito, Airspeed Horsa gliders.
9The prototype was the Lotus bicycle on which Chris
Boardman won the 4000 m individual pursuit in the 1992Olympic Games at Barcelona.

has a smaller resistance to corrosion fatigue. The latter
property is boosted by plating the carbon steel with asacriﬁciallayerofzincorcadmium.Bothtypesofsteelrespond well to the strain-hardening action of wiredrawing through tungsten carbide dies. Wheel rimsshould be strong, stiff, light and corrosion resistant.They are often formed by bending strips of extruded,precipitation-hardenable aluminium alloy to shape andjoining e.g. 6061-T6.
Conventional multi-spoked wheels generate energy-
absorbing turbulence during rotation. The distinctiveCFRP frontandrearwheelsofhighlyspecializedtime-trial machines, made by such ﬁrms as Lotus, Zipp,RMIT-AIS and Ultimate Bike, have a much loweraerodynamic coefﬁcient of drag. They are the prod-ucts of extensive computer-aided design programmes,windtunnelsimulationsandinstrumentedperformancetesting.
14.7 Fencing foils
A typical steel foil is about 0.9 m long and tapers toa rectangular cross-section of 4 mm ð3 mm. This
design gives a low resistance to buckling under thelarge axial stress produced when an opponent is struck
directly, an action which can bend the foil forcibly
into a radius as small as 20 cm. Traditionally, sword-makers use medium-carbon alloy steels of the typeemployed in engineering for springs. The extensiverange of elastic behaviour that is associated with ahigh yield strength is obviously desirable. The foil isformed by hot working 10 mm square bar stock andthen oil quenching and tempering to develop a marten-sitic structure with a yield strength in the order of
1500–1700 MN m
/NUL2. On occasion, during a fencing
bout, the applied stress exceeds the yield strength andthe foil deforms plastically: provided that the foil isdefect free, the fencer can restore straightness by care-ful reverse bending. In practice, however, used foilsare not defect free. During bouts, repeated blows fromthe opposing blade produce small nicks in the surface
416Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
of a foil. In time, it is possible for one of these stress-
raising notches to reach a critical size and to initiate
fatigue cracking within the tempered martensite. Finalfailure occurs without warning and the buttoned foilinstantly becomes a deadly weapon.
One research response to this problem was to con-
centrate upon improving fracture toughness and resis-tance to fatigue failure, thus eliminating instantaneity
of failure.
10In this alternative material, a steel–steel
composite, lightly tempered ﬁbres of martensite arealigned within a continuous matrix phase of tough
austenite. 10 mm square feedstock of duplex steel for
the blade-forging machine is produced by diffusionannealing packs of nickel-electroplated bars of springsteel at a temperature of 1000
°C, extruding and hot
working. While the bars are at elevated temperatures,nickel interdiffuses with the underlying steel. Nickel isa notable austenite ( /CR)-forming element, as indicated
previously in Figure 9.2. The optimum volume frac-
tion of tough austenite is about 5%. This duplex mate-
rial has the same speciﬁc stiffness as the conventionalsteel and has greater fracture toughness. In the eventof a surface nick initiating a crack in a longitudinalﬁlament of brittle martensite, the crack passes rapidlyacross the ﬁlament and, upon encountering the toughinterﬁlamentary austenite, abruptly changes direction
and spreads parallel to the foil axis, absorbing energy
as the austenite deforms plastically and new surfacesare formed. In practical terms, if the fencer should failto notice marked changes in the handling character-istics of a deteriorating foil, the prolonged nature ofﬁnal fracture is less likely to be dangerous and lifethreatening. Although safer, the duplex foil involves
increased material-processing costs and has a yield
strength about 5–10% lower than that of heat-treatedspring steel.
Highly alloyed maraging steels (Section 9.2.3) are
used nowadays for top-level competition fencing. Bycombining solid solution strengthening with ﬁne pre-cipitation in low-carbon martensite, they provide thedesired high yield strength and fracture toughness.
A typical composition is 0.03C (max)–18 Ni–9 Co
–5Mo –0.7Ti–0.1Al.

temperatures (say down to /NUL30
°C), low frictional drag
10Materials research conducted at Imperial College,
London, on behalf of the fencing sword manufacturers, Paul
Leon Equipment Co. Ltd, London (Baker, 1989).and resistance to prolonged contact with snow and
moisture. More speciﬁcally, in cross-country (Nordic)skiing, lightness is very important as it makes stridingless tiring. From a commercial aspect, it is desirablethat materials for individualitemsof equipment shouldbe able to display vivid, durable colours and designerlogos.
14.8.2 Snowboarding equipment
The bindings which secure a snowboarder’s boots tothe top surface of the board are highly stressed dur-ing a downhill run. Good binding design provides asensitive interaction between the board and the snow-boarder’s feet, facilitating jumps and turns. Moderndesigns are complex and usually employ a variety ofpolymers. Thus, the recent snowboarddesignshowninFigure 14.7 includes components made from an acetalhomopolar ( Delrin), a nylon-based polymer ( Zytel)
and a thermoplastic polyester elastomer ( Hytrel).
11
Highly crystalline Delrinis tough, having a low glass-
transition temperature ⊿Tg/triangleleft, and strong and fatigue
resistant. It is also suitably UV resistant and moisture
resistant. Zytelis tough at low temperatures, can be
moulded into complex shapes and can be stiffened byglass-ﬁbre reinforcement. The third polymer, Hytrel,
has properties intermediate to those of thermoplas-tics and elastomers, combining ﬂexibility, strength andfatigue resistance. Both Hytreland the nylon Zytrel
can be ﬁbre reinforced. Thus, some snowboard bladesare made from Zytrelreinforced with ﬁbres of either
glass or aramid ( Kevlar). Colourants mixed with the
resins give attractive moulded-in colours.

14.8.3 Skiing equipment
In the older sport of skiing, the principal items of
equipment are the boots, bindings, skis and poles.External Hytrel–Kevlar components have been used
to enhance the stiffness of ski boots; this feature givesthe boots a ﬁrmer grip on the skier’s ankles and leadsto better control of the skis. Polymers feature promi-nently in many design of ski bindings. For instance,
in the Fritschi Diamirtouring binding,
12acetal poly-
mer(Delrin)is used for the locking bar, heel release
lever, heel block and front swivel plate while glass-reinforced nylon (Zytel)is used for the front block and
the two base plates.
Modern ski designs aim at solving the conﬂicting
requirements of (i) longitudinal and torsional stiffnessthat will distribute the skier’s weight correctly and(ii) ﬂexibility that will enable the ski to conform to
irregularities in the snow contour (Easterling, 1993).
Originally, each ski runner was made from a singlepiece of wood, e.g. hickory. Laminated wood skisappeared in the 1930s. The adoption of polymers forski components in the 1950s, combining lightnessand resistance to degradation, was followed by theintroduction of metal frames for downhill skis, e.g.alloy steel, aluminium alloy. By the 1960s, GRP andCFRP were coming into prominence. The internalstructure of a ski is determined by the type of skiing
and, as Figure 14.8 shows, often uses a surprising
number of different materials. Skis usually have ashock-absorbing, cellular core that is natural (ash,hickory)and/orsynthetic(aramid, aluminium,titanium

have been used for the soles of skis.
Modern ski poles are tubular and designed to give
high speciﬁc stiffness and good resistance to impacts.Nowadays, CFRP–GRP hybrids are favoured. Thepointed tips are sometimes made of wear-resistantcarbide.
14.9 Safety helmets
14.9.1 Function and form of safety helmets
Most sports entail an element of personal risk. Themain function of a safety helmet is to protect thehuman skull and its fragile contents by absorbing asmuch as possible of the kinetic energy that is vio-lentlytransferredduringacollision.Thethreeprincipaldamaging consequences of sudden impact are fractureof the skull, linear acceleration of the brain relativeto the skull, and rotational acceleration of the brain.Although linear and rotational acceleration may occurat the same time, many mechanical testing proceduresfor helmets concentrate upon linear acceleration anduse it as a criterion of protection in speciﬁcations.
A typical helmet consists of an outer shell and a
foam liner. The shell is usually made from a strong,durable and rigid material that is capable of spreadingand redistributing the impacting forces without suffer-ing brittle fracture. This reduction in pressure lessensthe risk of skull fracture. The foam liner has a cel-lular structure that absorbs energy when crushed by
impact. Specialized designs of helmets are used in
cycling, horse riding, canoeing, mountaineering, ski-ing, skate boarding, ice hockey, etc. Some designsare quite rudimentary and offer minimal protection.
418Modern Physical Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
In general, the wearer expects the helmet to be com-
fortable to wear, lightweight, not restrict peripheral
vision unduly and be reasonably compact and/or aero-
dynamic. Production costs should be low. Increasing
the liner thickness is beneﬁcial but, if the use of hel-
metsistobepromoted,therearesizeconstraints.Thus,
for a cricket helmet, acceptable shell and liner thick-
nesses are about 2–3 mm and 15 mm, respectively
(Knowles et al., 1998).
Strong and tough helmet shells have been produced
from ABS and GRP. The great majority of shock-
absorbent foam linings are made from polystyrene
(Figure 14.9): polypropylene and polyurethane are
also used.
14.9.2 Mechanical behaviour of foams
Polymeric foams provide an extremely useful classof engineering materials (Gibson & Ashby, 1988;
Dyson, 1990). They can be readily produced in many
different structural forms by a wide variety of methods
usingeitherphysicalorchemicalblowingagents.Most
thermoplastic and thermosetting resins can be foamed.
The properties of a foam are a function of (i) the
solid polymer’s characteristics, (ii) the relative density
of the foam; that is, the ratio of the foam densityto the density of the solid polymer forming the cell
walls ⊿/SUB//SUB
s/triangleleft, and (iii) the shape and size of the cells.
Relative densityisparticularlyimportant;a widerange
is achievable (typically 0.05–0.2). Polymer foams are
often anisotropic. Broadly speaking, two main types
of structure are available: open-cell foams and closed-
cell foams. Between these two structural extremes lies
a host of intermediate forms.
In the case of safety helmets, the ability of a
liner foam to mitigate shock loading depends essen-
tially upon its compression behaviour. Initially, under
compressive stress, polymer foams deform in a lin-
ear–elastic manner as cell walls bend and/or stretch.
Figure 14.9 Cell structure of polystyrene foam, as used for
shock-absorbent packaging: average cell diameter 100 µm
(courtesy of Chris Hardy, School of Metallurgy and
Materials, University of Birmingham, UK) .With further increase in stress, cell walls buckle and
collapse like overloaded struts; in this second stage,
energyabsorptionismuchmorepronouncedanddefor-mation can be elastic or plastic, depending upon the
particular polymer. If the cells are of the closed type,
compression of the contained air makes an addi-tional and signiﬁcant contribution to energy absorp-
tion. Eventually the cell walls touch and stress rises
sharply as the foam densiﬁes. This condition occurswhen a liner of inadequate thickness ‘bottoms out’
against the helmet shell. The design of a helmet liner
should provide the desired energy absorption with-out ‘bottoming out’ and at the same time keep peak
stresses below a prescribed limit.
Some polymeric structures can recover their origi-
nal form viscoelastically and withstand a number of
heavy impacts; with others, a single impact can cause
permanent damage to the cell structure, e.g. expandedPS. After serious impact, helmets with this type of
liner should be destroyed. Although this requirement
is impracticable in some sporting activities, there arecases where single-impact PS liners are considered to
be adequate.
14.9.3 Mechanical testing of safety helmets
Various British Standards apply to protective helmets
and caps for sports such as climbing (BS 4423), horse-
and pony riding (BS EN 1384) and pedal cycling,
skateboarding and rollerskating (BS EN 1078). Theseactivities involve different hazards and accordingly the
testing procedures and requirements for shock absorp-
tion and resistance to penetration differ. In one typicalform of test, a headform (simulating the mass and
shape of the human head) is encased in a helmet
and allowed to fall freely through a certain distanceagainst a rigid anvil. Speciﬁed headform materials (BS
EN 960) depend on the nature of the impact test and
extend from laminated hardwood (beech) to alloyswith a low resonance frequency (Mg–0.5Zr). A tri-axial accelerometer is afﬁxed to the headform/helmet
assembly in the zone of impact. The area beneath the
curveofacontinuousgraphicalrecordofstrikingforcev. local deformation taken during the test provides
a useful measure of the kinetic energy absorbed as
the helmet structure is crushed. Speciﬁed values forpermissible peak acceleration at impact which appear
in test procedures vary but generally extend up to
about 300 g,w h e r e g(acceleration due to gravity) D
9.81 m s
/NUL2. Drop heightsrange from about 1 to 2.5 m,
depending upon the striking force required. Test spec-iﬁcations often include requirements for helmets to be
mechanically tested after exposure to extremes of tem-
perature, ultraviolet radiation and water. On occasions,unsafe and/or inadequate helmets are marketed: natu-
rally, closer international collaboration and regulation
is being sought.

Appendix 1
SI units
The Syst `eme Internationale d’Unit ´es (SI) was intro-
duced in the UK in the late 1960s. Historically, theSI can be traced from the metric enthusiasms ofNapoleonic times, through a centimetre–gram (c.g.)system, a centimetre–gram–second (c.g.s.) system, ametre–kilogram–second (MKS) system in 1900 anda metre–kilogram–second–ampere (MKSA Giorgi)system in 1950. Table A1 lists the seven basic unitsand Table A2 lists the preﬁxes.
The SI is ‘rational, comprehensive and coherent’.
Coherency means that the product or quotient of basic
units gives an appropriate derivedunit of the resultant
quantity. A coherent system facilitates manipulation ofunits, checking the dimensions of equations and, mostimportantly, the correlation of different disciplines.Some of the more frequently-used derived units aregiven in Table A3.
The force unit, the newton, is the cornerstone of the
SI. Appropriately, the gravitational attraction for anapple is roughly one newton. The SI unit of stress is
Nm
/NUL2: the pascal (Pa) is an orphan, being non-SI and
non-coherent. Energy is deﬁned in mechanical terms,being the work done when the point of application ofa force of 1 N is displaced through a distance of 1 min the direction of the force.

SI units 421
The surprising frequency with which SI units are
misused in textbooks, learned papers, reports, theses
and even examination papers, justiﬁes a reminder of
some rules:
1. Try to locate basic units after the solidus: 1 MN/m2
preferred to 1 N/mm2.
2. A space is signiﬁcant: ms is not the same as m s.3. Prior to calculations, convert to basic SI units:
1 mm becomes 1 ð10
/NUL3m.
4. Where possible, work in steps of 10š3.5. If possible, group digits in threes and avoid com-
mas: 37532 rather than 37,532 because a comma
means decimal point in some countries.
6. When selecting a preﬁx, arrange for the preced-
ing number to lie between 0.1 and 1000: use10 mm rather than 0.01 m. In a comparison, onemay break this rule, e.g. ‘increase from 900 kN to12000 kN’.
7. Do not use double preﬁxes: pF, not /SYN/SYNF.
8. Avoid multiples of the solidus: acceleration written
as m/s/s self-destructs.
