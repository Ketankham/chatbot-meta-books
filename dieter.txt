PREFACE
Mechanical metallurgy isthearea ofknowledge which deals with the
behavior andresponse ofmetals toapplied forces. Since itisnotapre-
cisely defined area, itwillmean different things todifferent persons. To
some itwillmean mechanical properties ofmetals ormechanical testing,
othersmayconsider thefield restricted totheplastic working andshaping
ofmetals, while stillothers confine their interests tothemore theoretical
aspects ofthe field,which merge withmetal physics andphysical metal-
lurgy. Stillanother groupmay consider thatmechanical metallurgy is
closely allied with applied mathematics andapplied mechanics. Inwrit-
ingthisbookanattempt hasbeenmade tocover, insome measure, this
great diversity ofinterests. Theobjective hasbeen toinclude theentire
scope ofmechanical metallurgy inonefairly comprehensive volume.
Thebook hasbeen divided into four parts. Part One,Mechanical
Fundamentals, presents themathematical framework formany ofthe
chapters which follow. Theconcepts ofcombined stress andstrain are
reviewed andextended into three dimensions. Detailed consideration
ofthetheories ofyielding andanintroduction totheconcepts ofplas-
ticity aregiven. Noattempt ismade tocarry thetopics inPartOneto
thedegree ofcompletion required fororiginal problem solving. Instead,
thepurpose istoacquaint metallurgically trained persons withthemathe-
matical language encountered insome areas ofmechanical metallurgy.
PartTwo, Metallurgical Fundamentals, deals with thestructural aspects
ofplastic deformation and fracture. Emphasis isontheatomistics of
flowandfracture andtheway inwhich metallurgical structure affects
these processes. Theconcept ofthedislocation isintroduced early in
PartTwoand isusedthroughout toprovide qualitative explanations for
suchphenomena asstrain hardening, theyield point, dispersed phase
hardening, andfracture. Amoremathematical treatment oftheproper-
tiesofdislocations isgiven inaseparate chapter. Thetopics covered in
PartTwostemfrom physical metallurgy. However, most topics aredis-
cussed ingreater detail andwith adifferent emphasis thanwhen they
are firstcovered intheusual undergraduate course inphysical metal-
lurgy. Certain topics thataremore physical metallurgy thanmechanical

VI rreraccPrefe
metallurgy areincluded toprovide continuity andthenecessary back-
ground forreaders whohave notstudied modern physical metallurgy.
PartThree, Applications toMaterials Testing, deals with theengineer-
ingaspects ofthecommon testing techniques ofmechanical failure of
metals. Chapters aredevoted tothetension, torsion, hardness, fatigue,
creep, andimpact tests. Others takeuptheimportant subjects of
residual stresses andthestatistical analysis ofmechanical-property data.
InPartThree emphasis isplaced ontheinterpretation ofthetestsand
ontheeffect ofmetallurgical variables onmechanical behavior rather
thanontheprocedures forconducting thetests. Itisassumed thatthe
actual performance ofthese tests willbecovered inaconcurrent labora-
tory course orinaseparate course. Part Four, Plastic Forming of
Metals, deals with thecommon mechanical processes forproducing use-
fulmetal shapes. Little emphasis isgiven tothedescriptive aspects of
thissubject, since thiscanbestbecovered byplant tripsandillustrated
lectures. Instead, themain attention isgiven tothemechanical and
metallurgical factors which control each process such asforging, rolling,
extrusion, drawing, andsheet-metal forming.
Thisbook iswritten forthesenior orfirst-year graduate student in
metallurgical ormechanical engineering, aswell asforpracticing engi-
neers inindustry. While most universities have instituted courses in
mechanical metallurgy ormechanical properties, there isagreat diversity
inthematerial covered and inthebackground ofthestudents taking
these courses. Thus, forthepresent there canbenothing likeastand-
ardized textbook onmechanical metallurgy. Itishoped thatthebreadth
andscope ofthisbook willprovide material forthesesomewhat diverse
requirements. Itisfurther hoped thattheexistence ofacomprehensive
treatment ofthefield ofmechanical metallurgy willstimulate thedevelop-
ment ofcourses which cover thetotal subject.
Since thisbook isintended forcollege seniors, graduate students, and
practicing engineers, itisexpected tobecome apart oftheir professional
library. Although there hasbeennoattempt tomake thisbook ahand-
book, some thought hasbeen given toproviding abundant references to
theliterature onmechanical metallurgy. Therefore, more references are
included than isusual intheordinary textbook. References have been
given topoint outderivations oranalyses beyond thescope ofthebook,
toprovide thekeytofurther information oncontroversial ordetailed
points, andtoemphasize important papers which areworthy offurther
study. Inaddition, abibliography ofgeneral references willbefound
attheendofeach chapter. Acollection ofproblems isincluded atthe
end ofthevolume. This isprimarily fortheuseofthereader who is
engaged inindustry andwho desires some check onhiscomprehension of
thematerial.

Preface vii
Thetask ofwriting thisbook hasbeenmainly oneofsifting andsorting
factsandinformation from theliterature andthemany excellent textson
specialized aspects ofthis subject. Tocover thebreadth ofmaterial
found inthisbook would require parts ofover 15standard texts and
countless review articles andindividual contributions. Aconscientious
effort hasbeenmade throughout togive credit tooriginal sources. For
theoccasional oversights thatmayhave developed during the"boiling-
down process" theauthor offers hisapologies. He isindebted tomany
authors andpublishers whoconsented tothereproduction ofillustrations.
Credit isgiven inthecaptions oftheillustrations.
Finally, theauthor wishes toacknowledge themany friends who
advised him inthiswork. Special mention should begiven toProfessor
A.W.Grosvenor, Drexel Institute ofTechnology, Dr.G.T.Home,

Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION
1-1.Scope ofThisBook
Mechanical metallurgy isthearea ofmetallurgy which isconcerned
primarily with theresponse ofmetals toforces orloads. The forces
may arisefrom theuseofthemetal asamember orpart inastructure
ormachine, inwhich case itisnecessary toknow something about the
limiting values which canbewithstood without failure. Ontheother
hand, theobjective maybetoconvert acastingot intoamore useful
shape, such asaflatplate, andhere itisnecessary toknow thecon-
ditions oftemperature and rate ofloading which minimize theforces
that areneeded todothejob.
Mechanical metallurgy isnotasubject which canbeneatly isolated
andstudied byitself. Itisacombination ofmany disciplines andmany
approaches totheproblem ofunderstanding theresponse ofmaterials to
forces. Ontheonehand istheapproach used inreference tostrength
ofmaterials and inthetheories ofelasticity andplasticity, where ametal
isconsidered tobeahomogeneous material whose mechanical behavior
canberather precisely described onthebasis ofonlyaveryfewmaterial
constants. Thisapproach isthebasis fortherational design ofstruc-
turalmembers andmachine parts, andthethree topics ofstrength of
materials, elasticity, andplasticity arecovered inPartOne ofthisbook
from amore generalized point ofviewthan isusually considered inafirst
course instrength ofmaterials. Thematerial covered inChaps. 1to3
canbeconsidered themathematical framework onwhich much ofthe
remainder ofthebook rests. Forstudents ofengineering whohavehad
anadvanced course instrength ofmaterials ormachine design, itproba-
blywillbepossible toskim rapidly over these chapters. However, for
most students ofmetallurgy andforpracticing engineers inindustry, itis
worth spending thetime tobecome familiar with themathematics pre-
sented inPartOne.
The theories ofstrength ofmaterials, elasticity, and plasticity lose
much oftheirpower when thestructure ofthemetal becomes animpor-

tant consideration and itcannolonger beconsidered asahomogeneous
medium. Examples ofthis areinthehigh-temperature behavior of
metals, where themetallurgical structure maycontinuously change with
time, orintheductile-to-brittle transition, which occurs inplain car-
bon steel. Thedetermination oftherelationship between mechanical
behavior andstructure (asdetected chiefly with microscopic andX-ray
techniques) isthemain responsibility ofthemechanical metallurgist.
When mechanical behavior isunderstood interms ofmetallurgical struc-
ture, itisgenerally possible toimprove themechanical properties orat
least tocontrol them. PartTwo ofthisbook isconcerned withthemetal-
lurgical fundamentals ofthemechanical behavior ofmetals. Metallurgi-
calstudents willfindthatsome ofthematerial inPartTwohasbeen
covered inaprevious course inphysical metallurgy, since mechanical
metallurgy ispart ofthebroader field ofphysical metallurgy. However,
these subjects areconsidered ingreater detail than isusually thecase in
afirstcourse inphysical metallurgy. Inaddition, certain topics which
pertain more tophysical metallurgy than mechanical metallurgy have
been included inorder toprovide continuity andtoassist nonmetallurgi-
calstudents whomaynothavehadacourse inphysical metallurgy.
The lastthree chapters ofPartTwo, especially Chap. 6,areconcerned
primarily with atomistic concepts oftheflowandfracture ofmetals.
Many ofthedevelopments inthese areas have been theresult ofthe
alliance ofthesolid-state physicist with themetallurgist. This isan
areawhere direct observation ispractically impossible and definitive
experiments ofanindirect nature aredifficult toconceive. Moreover,
itisanarea ofintense activity inwhich thelifetime ofaconcept ortheory
mayberather short. Therefore, inwriting these chapters anattempt
hasbeenmade toinclude only material which isgenerally validandto
minimize thecontroversial aspects ofthesubject.
Basic dataconcerning thestrength ofmetals andmeasurements forthe
routine control ofmechanical properties areobtained from arelatively
small number ofstandardized mechanical tests. Part Three, Appli-
cations toMaterials Testing, considers each ofthecommon mechanical
tests, notfrom theusual standpoint oftesting techniques, butinstead
from theconsideration ofwhat these tests tellabout theservice per-
formance ofmetals andhowmetallurgical variables affect theresults of
these tests. Much ofthematerial inPartsOneandTwohasbeen uti-

considerable detail required orbecause theanalysis isbeyond thescope

izedtechnology associated witheachmetalworking process, such asroll-
ingorextrusion, although some effort hasbeenmade togiveageneral
impression ofthemechanical equipment required andtofamiliarize the
reader withthespecialized vocabulary ofthemetalworking field. Major
emphasis hasbeen placed onpresenting afairly simplified picture ofthe
forces involved ineach process andhowgeometrical andmetallurgical
factors affect theforming loads andthesuccess ofthemetalworking
process.
1-2. Strength ofMaterials—Basic Assumptions
Strength ofmaterials isthebody ofknowledge which deals with the
relation betw^een internal forces, deformation, andexternal loads. In
thegeneral method ofanalysis used instrength ofmaterials the firststep
istoassume thatthemember isinequilibrium. Theequations ofstatic
equilibrium areapplied totheforces acting onsome part ofthebody in
order toobtain arelationship between theexternal forces acting onthe
member andtheinternal forces resisting theaction oftheexternal loads.
Since theequations ofequilibrium must beexpressed interms offorces
acting external tothebody, itisnecessary tomake theinternal resisting
forces intoexternal forces. This isdonebypassing aplane through the
body atthepoint ofinterest. Thepart ofthebody lying ononeside
ofthecutting plane isremoved andreplaced bytheforces itexerted on
thecutsection ofthepart ofthebody that remains. Since theforces
acting onthe"freebody" hold itinequilibrium, theequations ofequi-
librium maybeapplied totheproblem.
Theinternal resisting forces areusually expressed bythestress^ acting
over acertain area, sothattheinternal force istheintegral ofthestress
times thedifferential areaoverwhich itacts. Inorder toevaluate this
integral, itisnecessary toknow thedistribution ofthestress over the
area ofthecutting plane. The stress distribution isarrived atbyobserv-
ingandmeasuring thestrain distribution inthemember, since stress
cannot bephysically measured. However, since stress isproportional to
strain forthesmall deformations involved inmost work, thedetermi-
nation ofthestrain distribution provides thestress distribution. The
expression forthestress isthen substituted intotheequations ofequi-
*Forpresent purposes stress isdefined asforce perunit area. Thecompanion term
strain isdefined asthechange inlength perunit length. More complete definitions
willbegiven later.

librium, andthey aresolved forstress interms oftheloads anddimen-
sions ofthemember.
Important assumptions instrength ofmaterials arethat thebody
which isbeing analyzed iscontinuous, homogeneous, and isotropic. A
continuous body isonewhich doesnotcontain voids orempty spaces of
anykind.Abody ishomogeneous ifithasidentical properties atall
points. Abody isconsidered tobeisotropic with respect tosome property
when that property does notvary with direction ororientation. A
property which varies with orientation with respect tosome system of
axes issaidtobeanisotropic.
While engineering materials such assteel, cast iron,andaluminum may
appear tomeet these conditions when viewed onagross scale, itisreadily
apparent when they areviewed through amicroscope thatthey areany-
thing buthomogeneous andisotropic. Most engineering metals aremade
upofmore than onephase, with different mechanical properties, such
thatonamicro scale they areheterogeneous. Further, even asingle-
phase metal willusually exhibit chemical segregation, andtherefore the
properties willnotbeidentical from point topoint. Metals aremadeup
ofanaggregate ofcrystal grains having different properties indifferent
crystallographic directions. Thereason why theequations ofstrength
ofmaterials describe thebehavior ofrealmetals isthat, ingeneral, the
crystal grains aresosmall that, foraspecimen ofanymacroscopic vol-
ume, thematerials arestatistically homogeneous and isotropic. How-
ever,when metals areseverely deformed inaparticular direction, asin
rolling orforging, themechanical properties may beanisotropic ona
macro scale.
1-3. Elastic and Plastic Behavior
Experience shows that allsolid materials canbedeformed when sub-
jected toexternal load. Itisfurther found thatuptocertain limiting
loads asolid willrecover itsoriginal dimensions when theload isremoved.
Therecovery oftheoriginal dimensions ofadeformed bodywhen the
load isremoved isknown aselastic behavior. Thelimiting loadbeyond
which thematerial nolonger behaves elastically istheelastic limit. If
theelastic limit isexceeded, thebody willexperience apermanent setor
deformation when theload isremoved. Abody which ispermanently
deformed issaidtohaveundergone plastic deformation.
Formost materials, aslong astheload does notexceed theelastic
limit, thedeformation isproportional totheload. This relationship is
known asHooke's law; itismore frequently stated asstress isproportional
tostrain. Hooke's lawrequires that theload-deformation relationship
should belinear. However, itdoesnotnecessarily follow that allmate-

Sec. 1-4] Introduction
rialswhich behave elastically willhave alinear stress-strain relationship.
Rubber isanexample ofamaterial withanonlinear stress-strain relation-
shipthat still satisfies thedefinition ofanelastic material.
Elastic deformations inmetals arequite smallandrequire very sensi-
tive instruments fortheir measurement. Ultrasensitive instruments
haveshown that theelastic limits ofmetals aremuch lower than the
values usually measured inengineering tests ofmaterials. Asthemeas-
uring devices become more sensitive, theelastic limit isdecreased, sothat
formost metals there isonly arather narrow range ofloads overwhich
Hooke's law strictly applies. This is,however, primarily ofacademic
importance. Hooke's lawremains aquite valid relationship forengi-
neering design.
•(_4.Average Stress and Strain
Asastarting point inthediscussion ofstress and strain, consider a
uniform cylindrical barwhich issubjected toanaxial tensile load (Fig.

Ifthestress isdistributed uniformly overtheareaA,that is,ifaiscon-
stant, Eq. (1-2)becomes
P=ajdA=(tA
cr=j(1-3)
Ingeneral, thestress willnotbeuniform overtheareaA,andtherefore
Eq. (1-3) represents anaverage stress. Forthestress tobeabsolutely-
uniform, every longitudinal element inthebarwould have toexperience
exactly thesame strain, andtheproportionality between stress andstrain
would have tobeidentical foreach element. Theinherent anisotropy
between grains inapolycrystalline metal rules outthepossibility ofcom-
plete uniformity ofstress overabody ofmacroscopic size. Thepresence
ofmore than onephase alsogives risetononuniformity ofstress ona
microscopic scale. Ifthebar isnotstraight ornotcentrally loaded, the
strains willbedifferent forcertain longitudinal elements andthestress
willnotbeuniform. Anextreme disruption intheuniformity ofthe
stress pattern occurs when there isanabrupt change incross section.
This results inastress raiser orstress concentration (seeSec. 2-13).
Inengineering practice, theload isusually measured inpounds and
thearea insquare inches, sothat stress hasunits ofpounds persquare
inch (psi). Since itiscommon forengineers todealwith loads inthe
thousands ofpounds, anobvious simpHfication istowork with units of
1,000 lb,called kips. The stressmaybeexpressed inunits ofkipsper
square inch (ksi). (1ksi=1,000 psi.) Inscientific work stresses are
often expressed inunits ofkilograms persquare millimeter ordynes per
square centimeter. (1kg/mm^ =9.81X10^dynes/cml)

The determination ofthe elastic

instrument. Forthese reasons itisoften replaced bytheproportional
limit, point A'.Theproportional limit isthestress atwhich thestress-
strain curve deviates from linearity. Theslope ofthestress-strain curve

bytheyield strength, point B.Theyield strength isdefined asthestress
which willproduce asmallamount ofpermanent deformation, generally
astrain equal to0.2percent or0.002 inches perinch. InFig. 1-3
thispermanent strain, oroffset, isOC. Plastic deformation begins
when theelastic limit isexceeded. Astheplastic deformation ofthe
specimen increases, themetal becomes stronger (strain hardening) so
that theload required toextend thespecimen increases with further
straining. Eventually theload reaches amaximum value. Themaxi-
mum load divided bytheoriginal area ofthespecimen istheultimate
tensile strength. Foraductile metal thediameter ofthespecimen
begins todecrease rapidly beyona maximum load, sothat theload
required tocontinue deformation drops offuntil thespecimen fractures.
Since theaverage stress isbased ontheoriginal area ofthespecimen,
italsodecreases frommaximum load tofracture.
1-6. Ductile vs.Brittle Behavior
Thegeneral behavior ofmaterials under loadcanbeclassified asductile
orbrittle depending uponwhether ornotthematerial exhibits theability
toundergo plastic deformation. Figure 1-3illustrates thetension stress-
strain curve ofaductile material. Acompletely brittle material would

10 Mechanical Fundamentals [Chap. 1
fracture almost attheelastic limit (Fig. 1-4.0), while abrittle metal, such
aswhite cast iron,shows some slight measure ofplasticity before fracture
(Fig. 1-46). Adequate ductility isanimportant engineering consider-
ation, because itallows themate-
rialtoredistribute localized stresses.
When localized stresses atnotches
andother accidental stress concen-
trations donothave tobecon-
sidered, itispossible todesign for
static situations onthebasis of
average stresses. However, with
brittle materials, localized stresses
continue tobuild upwhen there
isnolocal yielding. Finally, a
crack forms atoneormore points
ofstress concentration, and it
spreads rapidly over thesection. Even ifnostress concentrations are
present inabrittle material, fracture will stilloccur suddenly because the
yield stress andtensile strength arepractically identical.
Itisimportant tonotethat brittleness isnotanabsolute property of
ametal. Ametal such astungsten, which isbrittle atroom temperature,
isductile atanelevated temperature. Ametal which isbrittle intension
may beductile under hydrostatic compression. Furthermore, ametal
which isductile intension atroom temperature canbecome brittle inthe

1-7.What Constitutes Failure?
Structural members andmachine elements can failtoperform their
intended functions inthree general ways:
1.Excessive elastic deformation
2.Yielding, orexcessive plastic deformation
3.Fracture
Anunderstanding ofthecommon types offailure isimportant ingood
design because itisalways necessary torelate theloads anddimensions
ofthemember tosome significant material parameter which limits the
load-carrying capacity ofthemember. For different types offailure,
different significant parameters willbeimportant.
Two general types ofexcessive elastic deformation may occur: (1)
excessive deflection under conditions ofstable equilibrium, such asthe

Sec. 1-7] Introduction 11
deflection ofbeam under gradually applied loads; (2)sudden deflection,
orbuckling, under conditions ofunstable equilibrium.
Excessive elastic deformation ofamachine partcanmean failure ofthe
machine justasmuch asifthepartcompletely fractured. Forexample,
ashaft which istooflexible cancause rapid wear ofthebearing, orthe
excessive deflection ofclosely mating parts canresult ininterference and
damage totheparts. Thesudden buckling type offailure mayoccur in
aslender column when theaxial loadexceeds theEuler critical load or
when theexternal pres.sure acting against athin-walled shell exceeds a
critical value. Failures due toexcessive elastic deformation arecon-
trolled bythemodulus ofelasticity, notbythestrength ofthematerial.
Generally, little metallurgical control canbeexercised over theelastic
modulus. Themost effective way toincrease thestiffness ofamember
isusually bychanging itsshape andincreasing thedimensions ofits
cross section.
Yielding, orexcessive plastic deformation, occurs when theelastic limit
ofthemetal hasbeen exceeded. Yielding produces permanent change of
shape, whichmayprevent thepartfrom functioning properly anylonger.
Inaductile metal under conditions ofstatic loading atroom temperature
yielding rarely results infracture, because themetal strain hardens asit
deforms, andanincreased stress isrequired toproduce further deforma-
tion. Failure byexcessive plastic deformation iscontrolled bytheyield
strength ofthemetal forauniaxial condition ofloading. Formorecom-
plexloading conditions theyield strength isstillthesignificant parameter,
but itmust beusedwith asuitable failure criterion (Sec. 3-4). Attem-
peratures significantly greater thanroom temperature metals nolonger
exhibit strain hardening. Instead, metals cancontinuously deform at
constant stress inatime-dependent yielding known ascreep. The failure
criterion under creep conditions iscomplicated bythefactthat stress is
notproportional tostrain andthefurther factthatthemechanical proper-
tiesofthematerial maychange appreciably during service. Thiscom-
plexphenomenon willbeconsidered ingreater detail inChap. 13.
Theformation ofacrack which canresult incomplete disruption of
continuity ofthemember constitutes fracture. Apartmade from a
ductile metal which isloaded statically rarely fractures likeatensile
specimen, because itwill first failbyexcessive plastic deformation.
However, metals failbyfracture inthree general ways: (1)sudden
brittle fracture; (2)fatigue, orprogressive fracture; (3)delayed fracture.
Intheprevious section itwasshown that abrittle material fractures
under static loads with littleoutward evidence ofyielding. Asudden
brittle type offracture canalsooccur inordinarily ductile metals under
certain conditions. Plain carbon structural steel isthemostcommon

12 Mechanical Fundamentals [Chap. 1
example ofamaterial withaductile-to-brittle transition. Achange from
theductile tothebrittle type offracture ispromoted byadecrease in
temperature, anincrease intherate ofloading, andthepresence ofa
complex state ofstress duetoanotch. Thisproblem isconsidered in
Chap. 14.
Most fractures inmachine parts areduetofatigue. Fatigue failures
occur inparts which aresubjected toalternating, orfluctuating, stresses.
Aminute crack starts atalocalized spot, generally atanotch orstress
concentration, andgradually spreads over thecross section until the
member breaks. Fatigue failure occurs without anyvisible signofyield-
ingatnominal oraverage stresses thatarewellbelow thetensile strength
ofthemetal. Fatigue failure iscaused byacritical localized tensile stress
which isvery difficult toevaluate, andtherefore design forfatigue failure
isbased primarily onempirical relationships using nominal stresses.
Fatigue ofmetals isdiscussed ingreater detail inChap. 12.
Onecommon type ofdelayed fracture isstress-rupture failure, which
occurs when ametal hasbeen statically loaded atanelevated temper-
ature foralongperiod oftime. Depending upon thestress andthetem-
perature theremaybenoyielding prior tofracture. Asimilar type of
delayed fracture, inwhich there isnowarning byyielding prior tofailure,
occurs atroom temperature when steel isstatically loaded inthepresence
ofhydrogen.
Allengineering materials show acertain variability inmechanical
properties, which inturncanbeinfluenced bychanges inheat treat-
ment orfabrication. Further, uncertainties usually exist regarding the
magnitude oftheapplied loads, andapproximations areusually neces-
sary incalculating thestresses for allbutthemost simple member.
Allowance must bemade forthepossibility ofaccidental loads ofhigh
magnitude. Thus, inorder toprovide amargin ofsafety andtoprotect
against failure from unpredictable causes, itisnecessary thattheallow-
able stresses besmaller than thestresses which produce failure. The
value ofstress foraparticular material used inaparticular waywhich is
considered tobeasafe stress isusually called theworking stress (Tw.For
static applications theworking stress ofductile metals isusually based
ontheyield strength aoand forbrittle metals ontheultimate tensile

Thevalue assigned tothefactor ofsafety depends onanestimate of
allthefactors discussed above. Inaddition, careful consideration should
begiven totheconsequences which would result from failure. Iffailure
would result inlossoflife,thefactor ofsafety should beincreased. The
type ofequipment willalsoinfluence thefactor ofsafety. Inmilitary
equipment, where lightweight maybeaprime consideration, thefactor

pected type ofloading. For static

2-1 .Introduction
Thepurpose ofthischapter istopresent themathematical relation-
ships forexpressing thestress andstrain atapointandtherelationships
between stress and strain inarigidbody which obeys Hooke's law.
While part ofthematerial covered inthischapter isareview ofinfor-
mation generally covered instrength ofmaterials, thesubject isextended
beyond thispoint toaconsideration ofstress andstrain inthree dimen-
sionsand toanintroduction tothetheory ofelasticity. Thematerial
included inthischapter isimportant foranunderstanding ofmost ofthe
phenomenological aspects ofmechanical metallurgy, andforthisreason
itshould begiven careful attention bythose readers towhom itis
unfamiliar. Inthespace available forthissubject ithasnotbeen possi-
bletocarry ittothepoint where extensive problem solving ispossible.
The material covered here should, however, provide abackground for
intelligent reading ofthemore mathematical literature inmechanical
metallurgy.
2-2. Description ofStress ataPoint
Asdescribed inSec. 1-8, itisoften convenient toresolve thestresses
atapoint intonormal andshear components. Inthegeneral casethe
shear components areatarbitrary angles tothecoordinate axes, sothat
itisconvenient toresolve each shear stress further intotwocomponents.
The general case isshown inFig. 2-1. Stresses acting normal tothe
faces oftheelemental cube areidentified bythesubscript which also
identifies thedirection inwhich thestress acts; that is,axisthenormal
stress acting inthexdirection. Since itisanormal stress, itmust act
ontheplane perpendicular tothexdirection. Byconvention, values of
normal stresses greater than zerodenote tension; values lessthan zero

indicate compression. Allthenormal stresses shown inFig. 2-1are
tensile.
Two subscripts areneeded fordescribing shearing stresses. The first
subscript indicates theplane inwhich thestress actsandthesecond the
direction inwhich thestress acts. Since aplane ismost easily defined
byitsnormal, the first subscript refers tothisnormal. Forexample,

positive directions ofthecoordinate axes arepositive ifatensile stress
onthesamecube face isinthepositive direction ofthecorresponding axis.
Alltheshear stresses shown inFig. 2-1arepositive.
Thenotation given above istheoneusedbyTimoshenko^ andmost
American workers inthe field ofelasticity. The reader isreminded,
however, that several other systems ofnotation areinuse. Before
attempting toreadpapers inthis field itisimportant tobecome familiar
with thenotation which isused.
Itcanbeseenfrom Fig. 2-1that nine quantities must bedefined in
order toestablish thestate ofstress atapoint. They areax, o-y, cr^,Txy,
Txz,Tyx, Tyz, T^x,and Tzy.Howcvcr, some simplification ispossible. Ifwe
assume thattheareas ofthefaces oftheunitcube aresmall enough so
that thechange instress over theface isnegligible, bytaking thesum-

important factsabout thisfigure:
1.Themaximum andminimum values ofnormal stress ontheoblique
plane through point occurwhen theshear stress iszero.
2.Themaximum andminimum values ofbothnormal stress andshear
stress occur atangles which are90°apart.
3.Themaximum shear stress occurs atanangle halfway between the
maximum andminimum normal stresses.
4.Thevariation ofnormal stress andshear stress occurs intheform

foranystate ofstress.

Foranystate ofstress itisalways possible todefine anewcoordinate
system which hasaxesperpendicular totheplanes onwhich themaxi-
mum normal stresses actandonwhich noshearing stresses act. These
planes arecalled theprincipal planes, andthestresses normal tothese
planes aretheprincipal stresses. Fortwo-dimensional plane stress there
willbetwoprincipal stresses aianda2which occur atangles thatare90°
apart (Fig. 2-3). Forthegeneral case ofstress inthree dimensions there
willbethree principal stresses ai, 0-2,and 0-3.According toconvention,
(Tiisthealgebraically greatest principal stress, while 0-3isthealgebraically
smallest stress. Thedirections oftheprincipal stresses aretheprincipal
axes 1,2,and 3.Although ingeneral theprincipal axes 1,2,and3do
notcoincide withthecartesian-coordinate axes x,y,z,formany situations
that areencountered inpractice thetwosystems ofaxes coincide because
ofsymmetry ofloading anddeformation. Thespecification oftheprinci-
palstresses andtheir direction provides aconvenient way ofdescribing
thestate ofstress atapoint.
Sincebydefinition aprincipal plane contains noshear stress, itsangu-
larrelationship with respect tothexycoordinate axescanbedetermined
byfinding thevalues of6inEq. (2-3) forwhich r=0.

shearing stresses ontheoblique plane aregiven bythecoordinates of
point F.The stresses onaplane perpendicular tommwould beobtained
byadvancing anadditional 180°ontheMohr's circle topoint G.This
shows thattheshearing stresses ontwoperpendicular planes arenumeri-
cally equal. Itcanalsobeseenfrom Fig.2-4thatOF'+OG'=20C.
Therefore, thesum ofthenormal stresses ontwoperpendicular planes is
aconstant, independent oftheorientation oftheplanes.

Thegeneral three-dimensional state ofstress consists ofthree unequal
principal stresses acting atapoint. This iscalled atriaxial state ofstress.
Iftwoofthethree principal stresses areequal, thestate ofstress isknown
ascylindrical, while ifallthree principal stresses areequal, thestate of
stress issaidtobehydrostatic, orspherical.

While theonly physical significance ofMohr's circle isthat itgives a
geometrical representation oftheequations thatexpress thetransforma-
tion ofstress components todifferent setsofaxes, itisaveryconvenient
way ofvisualizing thestate ofstress. Figure 2-8shows Mohr's circle
foranumber ofcommon states ofstress. Note that theapplication of
atensile stress aiatright angles toanexisting tensile stress ax(Fig. 2-8c)
results inadecrease intheprincipal shear stress ontwo ofthethree sets
ofplanes onwhich aprincipal shear stress acts. However, themaximum
shear stress isnotdecreased fromwhat itwould beforuniaxial tension,
although ifonly thetwo-dimensional Mohr's circle hadbeen used, this
would nothavebeen apparent. Ifatensile stress isapplied inthethird
principal direction (Fig. 2-8d), themaximum shear stress isreduced
appreciably. Forthelimiting case ofequal triaxial tension (hydrostatic
tension) Mohr's circle reduces toapoint, andthere arenoshear stresses
acting onanyplane inthebody. The effectiveness ofbiaxial- and tri-
axial-tension stresses inreducing theshear stresses results inaconsider-
abledecrease intheductility ofthematerial, because plastic deformation
isproduced byshear stresses. Thus, brittle fracture isinvariably associ-
atedwith triaxial stresses developed atanotch orstress raiser. Hovf

shear stress relative totheapplied tensile stress thematerial hasan
excellent opportunity todeform plastically without fracturing under this
state ofstress. Important use ismade ofthisfact intheplastic working

therelationship obtained from this figure tothethree-dimensional case.
Letthecoordinates ofapoint inanunstrained rigidbody bedefined by
X,y,and z.After strain isapplied, thepoint willundergo displacements
u,V,andwinthedirections x,y,and z.Inorder thatthedisplacement
oftheentire body begeometrically compatible, itisnecessary thatno
twoparticles occupy thesame point inspace orthatnovoids becreated
within thebody. Inorder tosatisfy these requirements, thedisplace-
mentcomponents u,v,andwmustvarycontinuously from point topoint.
Thiscanbeaccomplished iftheir gradients with respect tox,y,and z

Incomplete analogy with stress, itispossible todefine asystem of
coordinate axesalong which there arenoshear strains. These axes are
theprincipal strain axes. Foranisotropic body thedirections ofthe
principal strains coincide with those oftheprincipal stresses.^ Anele-
ment oriented along oneofthese principal axes willundergo pure exten-
sion orcontraction without anyrotation orshearing strains. Aswith
principal stresses, thelargest andsmallest linear strains atapoint inthe
body aregiven bythevalues oftheprincipal strains.
Methods similar tothose used inSec. 2-5, forthederivation ofthe
equation forthevalues ofthethree principal stresses, and inSec. 2-3,
forthenormal andshear stresses onanyplane through apoint inthe
body, canbeused forthederivation^ ofsimilar quantities interms of
strain. However, these equations maybeobtained much more easily by
replacing aandrinthestress equation byeand7/2. Forexample, the

Except inafewcases involving contact stresses, itisnotpossible to
measure stress directly. Therefore, experimental measurements ofstress
areactually based onmeasured strains andareconverted tostresses by
means ofHooke's lawandthemore general relationships which aregiven
inSec.2-10. Themost universal strain-measuring device isthebonded-
wireresistance gage, frequently called theSR-4 strain gage. These gages
aremade upofseveral loops offinewire orfoilofspecial composition,
which arebonded tothesurface ofthebody tobestudied. When the
body isdeformed, thewires inthegage arestrained andtheir electrical
resistance isaltered. Thechange inresistance, which isproportional to
strain, canbeaccurately determined with asimple Wheatstone-bridge
circuit. Thehigh sensitivity, stability, comparative ruggedness, andease
ofapplication make resistance strain gages averypowerful toolforstrain
determination.
Forpractical problems ofexperimental stress analysis itisoften impor-
tant todetermine theprincipal stresses. Iftheprincipal directions are
known, gages canbeoriented inthese directions andtheprincipal stresses

ofthePoisson effect, corrections forlateral strains must bemadebyusing

2-1 1.Generalized Stress-Strain Relationships
The stress-strain relationships given intheprevious twosections con-
tainthree elastic constants E,G,and v.These aretheonly material
constants needed todescribe theelastic stress-strain behavior provided
thatthematerial canbeconsidered isotropic. However, many materials
areanisotropic ;i.e.,theelastic properties varywith direction. Ametallic
single crystal isanextreme example ofananisotropic elastic material,
while cold-worked metals may alsoexhibit anisotropic elastic behavior.
However, intheusual casewith engineering materials thegrain size is
small enough andthegrains areinasufficiently random arrangement
sothattheequations based onisotropic conditions maybeused.
Inorder toconsider thepossibility ofelastic constants which varywith
orientation inthematerial, Hooke's lawcanbewritten incompletely
general terms asalinear relationship between strain and stress.

concerning thestrain distribution.

Note thatthese equilibrium equations donotgivearelationship between

between stress andexternal loadmust besuch that attheboundary of
thebody thestresses become equal tothesurface forces perunit area;
i.e., itmust satisfy theboundary conditions.
One oftheimportant requirements ofthetheory ofelasticity isthat
thedeformation ofeachelement must besuch that elastic continuity is
preserved. Physically, thismeans that thestresses must vary sothat
nogaps occur inthematerial. The equations ofcompatibility forthe

Basically, thesolution ofaproblem with thetheory ofelasticity
requires thedetermination ofanexpression forthestresses (Tx, <Ty,r^yin
terms oftheexternal loads that satisfies theequations ofequilibrium
[Eqs. (2-37)], theequations ofcompatibility [Eq. (2-39)], andthebound-
aryconditions. Such asolution generally involves considerable mathe-
matical agility. Most ofthecomplications attending thetheory of
elasticity arise out ofthenecessity forsatisfying therequirement of
continuity ofelastic deformation. Insolutions bystrength ofmaterials
continuity ofdeformation isnotalways satisfied. Continuity ismain-
tained bylocal plastic yielding. Generally, thisdoesnothaveanimpor-
tant effect onthesolution because theeffects ofyielding donotextend
farbeyond theregion where they occur. Inother problems, such asthe
determination ofstresses atgeometrical discontinuities (stress raisers),
localized yielding isimportant, andthemethods ofthetheory ofelasticity
must beused.
Onemethod which isused forthesolution ofproblems bythetheory
ofelasticity istofindafunction $inxandywhich satisfies Eqs. (2-37)
and (2-39) andalsoexpresses thestresses interms oftheloads. Such a
function isusually called theAiry stress function. Airy^ showed that
there willalways exist afunction inxandyfromwhich thestresses at
anypoint canbedetermined bythefollowing equations:
-^=^-pgy ^^=^.-m ^^y--^^j(2-40)
Equations (2-40) satisfy theequations ofequilibrium. Inorder tosatisfy

intoEq.(2-39).

Ifastress function canbefound fortheproblem which satisfies Eq.
(2-41), thestresses aregiven byEqs. (2-40) provided that Eqs. (2-40)
also satisfy theboundary conditions oftheproblem. Thediscovery of
astress function which satisfies both Eq.(2-41) andtheboundary con-
ditions isusually noteasy,andtherefore onlyafairly limited number of
problems havebeen solved bythistechnique. Forproblems withcom-
plicated geometry andloading systems itisusually necessary touse

Ageometrical discontinuity inabody, such asahole oranotch,
results inanonuniform stress distribution atthevicinity ofthediscon-
tinuity. Atsome region nearthediscontinuity thestress willbehigher
than theaverage stress atdistances removed from thediscontinuity.
Thus, astress concentration occurs atthediscontinuity, orstress raiser.

uniformly distributed overthecross section oftheplateand itwould be
equal totheloaddivided bythecross-sectional area oftheplate. With
thehole present, thedistribution issuch thattheaxial stress reaches a
highvalue attheedges oftheholeanddrops offrapidly with distance
away from thehole.
The stress concentration isexpressed byatheoretical stress-concen-
tration factor Kt. Generally Ktisdescribed astheratio ofthemaximum
stress tothenominal stress based onthenetsection, although some
workers useavalue ofnominal stress based ontheentire cross section

where aistheuniform tensile stress applied attheends oftheplate.
Thetheoretical stress-concentration factor foraplate withacircular hole
istherefore equal to3.Further study ofthese equations shows that
(To=—aforr—aand=0.Therefore, when atensile stress isapplied
totheplate, acompressive stress ofequal magnitude exists attheedge
ofthehole atpointBinadirection perpendicular totheaxis ofloading
intheplane oftheplate.
Another interesting case forwhich ananalytical solution forthestress
concentration isavailable^ isthecase ofasmall elliptical hole inaplate.
Figure 2-156 shows thegeometry ofthehole. Themaximum stress at
theends ofthehole isgiven bytheequation
K^+^O(2-45)
Note that, foracircular hole (a=b),theabove equation reduces to
Eq. (2-44). Equation (2-45) shows that thestress increases with the
ratio a/b. Therefore, averynarrow hole, such asacrack, normal tothe
tensile direction willresult inavery high stress concentration.
Mathematical complexities prevent thecalculation ofelastic stress-
concentration factors inallbutthesimplest geometrical cases. Much of
thiswork hasbeencompiled byNeuber,^ whohasmade calculations for
various types ofnotches. Stress-concentration factors forpractical prob-
lems areusually determined byexperimental methods.^ Photoelastic
analysis^ ofmodels isthemost widely used technique. Thismethod is
especially applicable toplane-stress problems, although itispossible to
make three-dimensional photoelastic analyses. Figure 2-16shows typical

elements thatwere obtained byphotoelastic methods. Much ofthe
information onstress concentrations inmachine parts hasbeen collected
byPeterson.1
The effect ofastress raiser ismuch more pronounced inabrittle
material than inaductile material. Inaductile material, plastic defor-
mation occurs when theyield stress isexceeded atthepoint ofmaximum
stress. Further increase inloadproduces alocal increase instrain atthe
critically stressed region with little increase instress. Because ofstrain
hardening, thestress increases inregions adjacent tothestress raiser,
until, ifthematerial issufficiently ductile, thestress distribution becomes
essentially uniform. Thus, aductile metal loaded statically willnot
develop thefulltheoretical stress-concentration factor. However, redis-
tribution ofstress willnotoccur toanyextent inabrittle material, and
therefore astress concentration ofclose tothetheoretical value will
result. Although stress raisers arenotusually dangerous inductile
materials subjected tostatic loads, appreciable stress-concentration
effects willoccur inductile materials under fatigue conditions ofalter-
nating stresses. Stress raisers areveryimportant inthefatigue failure
ofmetals and willbediscussed further inChap. 12.

Experiment shows thatmaterials canwithstand very large hydrostatic
pressures (spherical state ofstress) without undergoing plastic defor-

ELEMENTS OF
THETHEORY OFPLASTICITY
3-1 .Introduction
Thetheory ofplasticity deals with thebehavior ofmaterials inthe
region ofstrain beyond which Hooke's law isnolonger valid. The
mathematical description oftheplastic deformation ofmetals isnot
nearly sowelldeveloped asthedescription ofelastic deformation by
means ofthetheory ofelasticity because plastic deformation ismuch
more complicated than elastic deformation. Forexample, intheplastic
region ofstrain, there isnosimple relationship between stress andstrain
asthere isfor elastic deformation. Moreover, elastic deformation
depends onlyontheinitial and final states ofstress and isindependent
oftheloading path, butforplastic deformation theplastic strain depends
notonlyonthefinalloadbutalsoonthepathbywhich itwasreached.
Thetheory ofplasticity isconcerned with anumber ofdifferent types
ofproblems. From theviewpoint ofdesign, plasticity isconcerned with
predicting themaximum loadwhich canbeapplied toabody without
causing excessive yielding. The yield criterion^ must beexpressed in
terms ofstress insuch awaythat itisvalid forallstates ofstress. The
designer isalsoconcerned with plastic deformation inproblems where
thebody ispurposely stressed beyond theyield stress intotheplastic
region. Forexample, plasticity must beconsidered indesigning for
processes such asautofrettage, shrink fitting, andtheoverspeeding of
rotor disks. Theconsideration ofsmall plastic strains allows economies
inbuilding construction through theuseofthetheory oflimit design.
The analysis oflarge plastic strains isrequired inthemathematical
treatment oftheplastic forming ofmetals. This aspect ofplasticity
1Thedetermination oftheHmiting loadbetween elastic andplastic behavior isalso
generally covered instrength ofmaterials. However, because itisnecessary toadopt
ayield criterion inthetheories ofplasticity, thistopic iscovered inthechapter on

willbeconsidered inPart Four. Itisvery difficult todescribe, ina
rigorous analytical way, thebehavior ofametal under these conditions.
Therefore, certain simplifying assumptions areusually necessary toobtain
atractable mathematical solution.
Another aspect ofplasticity isconcerned withacquiring abetter under-
standing ofthemechanism oftheplastic deformation ofmetals. Interest
inthis field iscentered ontheimperfections incrystalline solids. The
effect ofmetallurgical variables, crystal structure, and lattice imperfec-
tions onthedeformation behavior areofchief concern. This aspect of
plasticity isconsidered inPartTwo.
3-2.TheFlow Curve
The stress-strain curve obtained byuniaxial loading, asintheordinary
tension test, isoffundamental interest inplasticity when thecurve is
plotted interms oftrue stress a-andtrue strain e.True stress isgiven
bytheloaddivided bytheinstantaneous cross-sectional area ofthespeci-
men. True strain isdiscussed inthenext section. Thepurpose ofthis
section' istodescribe typical stress-strain curves forrealmetals andto
compare them with thetheoretical flowcurves forideal materials.
Thetrue stress-strain curve foratypical ductile metal, such asalumi-
num, isillustrated inFig. 3-la. Hooke's law isfollowed uptosome yield

stress o-Q.(The value ofo-qwilldepend upon theaccuracy withwhich
strain ismeasured.) Beyond cro,themetal deforms plastically. Most
metals strain-harden inthis region, sothat increases instrain require
higher values ofstress than the initial yield stress cro.However, unlike
thesituation intheelastic region, thestress andstrain arenotrelated by

strain curve.

anysimple constant ofproportionality. Ifthemetal isstrained topoint
A,when theload isreleased thetotal strain willimmediately decrease
from €itoC2byanamount a/E. The strain decrease ei—eoisthe
recoverable elastic strain. However, thestrain remaining isnot allperma-
nent plastic strain. Depending upon themetal andthetemperature, a
smallamount oftheplastic strain €2—€3willdisappear with time. This
isknown asanelastic behavior.^Generally theanelastic strain isneg-
lected inmathematical theories ofplasticity.
Generally thestress-strain curve onunloading from aplastic strain
willnotbeexactly linear and parallel totheelastic portion ofthecurve
(Fig. 3-16). Moreover, onreloading thecurve willgenerally bend over
asthestress approaches theoriginal value ofstress fromwhich itwas
unloaded. With alittle additional plastic strain, thestress-strain curve
becomes acontinuation ofwhat itwould have beenhadnounloading
taken place. Thehysteresis behavior resulting fromunloading andload-
ingfrom aplastic strain isgenerally neglected inplasticity theories.
Atrue stress-strain curve isfrequently called aflow curve because it
gives thestress required tocause themetal toflow plastically toany
given strain. Many attempts havebeenmade tofitmathematical equa-
tions tothiscurve. Themostcommon isapower expression oftheform
a=Ke (3-1)
whereKisthestress ate=1.0and n,thestrain-hardening coefficient,
istheslope ofalog-log plot ofEq. (3-1). This equation canbevalid
onlyfrom thebeginning ofplastic flow tothemaximum load atwhich
thespecimen begins toneckdown.
Even thesimple mathematical expression fortheflowcurve that is
givenbyEq. (3-1) canresult inconsiderable mathematical complexity
when itisusedwiththeequations ofthetheory ofplasticity. Therefore,
inthis field itiscommon practice todevise idealized flowcurves which
simplify themathematics without deviating toofarfrom physical reality.
Figure 3-2ashows theflowcurve forarigid, perfectly plastic material.
For thisidealized material, atensile specimen iscompletely rigid (zero
elastic strain) until theaxial stress equals cro,whereupon thematerial
flows plastically ataconstant flow stress (zero strain hardening). This
type ofbehavior isapproached byaductile metal which isinahighly
cold-worked condition. Figure 3-26 illustrates theflow curve fora
perfectly plastic material with anelastic region. This behavior is
approached byamaterial such asplain-carbon steelwhich hasapro-
nounced yield-point elongation (seeSec. 5-5).Amore realistic approach
istoapproximate theflowcurve bytwostraight lines corresponding to
1Anelasticity isdiscussed ingreater detail inChap. 8.

andduring theextension thegagelength changes considerably. Ludwik^

ates this difficulty. Inthisdefinition ofstrain thechange inlength is

Thetwomeasurements ofstrain give nearly identical results upto

Because thevolume remains essentially constant during plastic defor-

This relationship isnotvalid fortheprincipal conventional strains.
Theadvantage ofusing true strain should beapparent from thefollow-
ingexample: Consider auniform cylinder which isextended totwice its
original length. The linear strain isthen e=(2Lo—Lo)/Lo =1.0,ora
strain of100percent. Toachieve thesameamount ofnegative linear
strain incompression, thecylinder would have tobesqueezed tozero
thickness. However, intuitively weshould expect that thestrain pro-
duced incompressing acylinder tohalf itsoriginal length would bethe
same as,although opposite insign to,thestrain produced byextending
thecylinder totwice itslength. Iftrue strain isused, equivalence is
obtained forthetwo cases. Forextension totwice theoriginal length,
e=In(2Lo/Lo) =In2.Forcompression tohalf theoriginal length,
€=In[(Lo/2)/Lo] =InM=-In2.
3-4. yielding Criteria forDuctile Metals
Theproblem ofdeducing mathematical relationships forpredicting
theconditions atwhich plastic yielding begins when amaterial issub-
jected toacomplex state ofstress isanimportant consideration inthe
field ofplasticity. Inuniaxial loading, plastic flowbegins attheyield
stress, and itistobeexpected that yielding under asituation ofcom-
bined stresses isrelated tosome particular combination oftheprinci-
pal stresses. Ayield criterion canbeexpressed inthegeneral form
F(ai,a2,(T3,ki, . ..)=0,butthere isatpresent notheoretical way ofcal-
culating therelationship between thestress components tocorrelate yield-
inginathree-dimensional state ofstress with yielding intheuniaxial
tension test. The yielding criteria aretherefore essentially empirical
relationships. Atpresent, there aretwogenerally accepted theories for
predicting theonset ofyielding inductile metals.
Maximum-shear-stress Theory
Themaximum-shear-stress theory, sometimes called theTresca, Cou-
lomb, orGuest yield criterion, states that yielding willoccurwhen the

According tothis criterion, yielding willoccur when thedifferences
between theprincipal stresses expressed bytheright-hand side ofthe
equation exceed theyield stress inuniaxial tension, ao.Thedevelop-
ment ofthisyield criterion isassociated with thenames ofVonMises,
Hencky, Maxwell, andHuber. VonMises proposed thiscriterion inthe
invariant form givenbyEq.(3-13) primarily because itwasmathemati-
cally simpler than theinvariant form ofthemaximum-shear-stress theory
given byEq. (3-11). Subsequent experiments showed thatEq. (3-13)
provides better over-all agreement withcombined stress-yielding data
than themaximum-shear-stress theory.

Anumber ofattempts have beenmade toprovide physical meaning
totheVonMises yield criterion. Onecommonly accepted concept is
that thisyield criterion expresses thestrain energy ofdistortion. Onthe
basis ofthedistortion-energy concept, yielding willoccurwhen thestrain
energy ofdistortion perunitvolume exceeds thestrain energy ofdistor-
tionperunitvolume foraspecimen strained totheyield stress inuniaxial
tension orcompression. Thederivation ofEq. (3-12) onthebasis of
distortion energy isgiven below. Another common physical interpreta-
tion ofEq.(3-12) isthat itrepresents thecritical value oftheoctahedral
shear stress (seeSec. 3-7).
The total elastic strain energy perunitvolume (seeSec.2-15) canbe
divided intotwocomponents, thestrain energy ofdistortion, Uq,andthe
strain energy ofvolume change, Uq.Toillustrate theresolution oftotal
strain energy into itscomponents, consider Fig. 3-3. This figure illus-
trates thepoint established inSec.2-14thatageneral three-dimensional
state ofstress canbeexpressed interms ofaspherical orhydrostatic
component ofstress, a",andastress deviator, a'.Because experiments
haveshown1thatuptorather large values ofhydrostatic pressure a
hydrostatic state ofstress hasnoeffect onyielding, itisvalid toassume
that only thestress deviator canproduce distortion. Therefore, the

yield stress fallsbetween 0.5and0.6ofthetensile yield stress, with the
average occurring close tothepredicted value. Itshould benoted that
themaximum-shear-stress theory predicts that tq=0.50(7o. Thebetter

Axial tension canbecombined with torsion togivevarious combinations

Aconvenient way ofcomparing yielding criteria foratwo-dimensional

shear-stress theory andthedistor-

yield stress forconditions ofuni-
axial stress andbalanced biaxial

vergence between thetwotheories

shown that forthis state ofstress

3-6.Octahedral Shear Stress andShear Strain
Theoctahedral stresses areaparticular setofstress functions which
areimportant inthetheory ofplasticity. They arethestresses acting
onthefaces ofathree-dimensional octahedron which hasthegeometric
property thatthefaces oftheplanes make equal angles witheach ofthe
three principal directions ofstress. Forsuchageometric body, theangle
between thenormal tooneofthefacesandthenearest principal axis is
54°44', andthecosine ofthisangle isl/-\/3.
The stress acting oneach face oftheoctahedron canberesolved^ into
anormal octahedral stress o-Qctandanoctahedral shear stress lying inthe
octahedral plane, Xoct.Thenormal octahedral stress isequal tothehydro-

Theoctahedral shear stress r„ct isgivenby

Since thenormal octahedral stress isahydrostatic stress, itcannot pro-
duce yielding insolid materials. Therefore, theoctahedral shear stress
isthecomponent ofstress responsible forplastic deformation. Inthis
respect, itisanalogous tothestress deviator.

3-7. Invariants ofStress and Strain
Itisfrequently useful tosimplify therepresentation ofacomplex state
ofstress orstrain bymeans ofinvariant functions ofstress and strain.
Iftheplastic stress-strain curve (theflowcurve) isplotted interms of
invariants ofstress and strain, approximately thesame curve willbe
obtained regardless ofthestate ofstress. Forexample, theflowcurves
obtained inauniaxial-tension testandabiaxial-torsion testofathintube
with internal pressure willcoincide when thecurves areplotted interms
ofinvariant stress andstrain functions.
Nadai^ hasshown thattheoctahedral shear stress andshear strain are
invariant functions which describe theflowcurve independent ofthetype
oftest. Other frequently used invariant functions arethe effective, or
significant, stress andstrain. These quantities aredefined bythefollow-
ingequations forthecasewhere thecoordinate axescorrespond tothe

3-8. Basis oftheTheories ofPlasticity
Thedevelopment ofageneralized theory ofplasticity, wnth thesame
wide applicability asthetheory ofelasticity, hasnotprogressed rapidly
because ofthecomplexity oftheproblem. Theinherent difficulty in
developing asimple mathematical description ofplasticity liesinthefact
that plastic deformation isessentially anirreversible process. While
elastic deformation depends onlyontheinitial and final states ofstress
orstrain andtherefore theresults areindependent ofthepath along
which theload isreached, inplastic deformation thetotal plastic strain
depends notonlyonthefinal loadbutalsoonthepathbywhich itwas
reached. Therefore, inplastic deformation, thetype ofload cycle deter-
mines thestrain increment. The finalvalue ofaplastic-strain component
isgiven bytheintegral oftheincrements oftheplastic-strain component
overtheloading history thatthematerial hasundergone.
Aparticular condition ofloading which simplifies theanalysis is'propor-
tional loading. Forproportional loading, thestress components increase
inconstant ratio toeach other.

68 Mechanical Fundamentals [Chap. 3
Mathematical theories ofplasticity canbedivided roughly intotwo
types. Deformation theories relate thestress tothestrain, while flow
theories relate thestress tothestrain rate, orthevelocity ofstrain.
Deformation theories utilize anaveraging process over theentire defor-
mation history andrelate thetotal plastic strain tothefinal stress. This
tj^pe oftheory isvalidwhen thematerial issubjected toproportional
loading, but itisnotgenerally considered tobereliable^ when thedirec-
tion ofloading ischanged during thetest. Flow theories consider asuc-
cession ofinfinitesimal increments ofdistortion inwhich theinstantaneous
stress isrelated totheincrement ofthestrain rate. Because aflowtheory
considers theinstantaneous deformation, itisbetter abletodescribe large
plastic deformations.
There areanumber ofgeneral assumptions which arecommon toall
plasticity theories. Themetal isconsidered tobecontinuous and iso-
tropic. The principal axes ofplastic stress and strain areassumed to
coincide atalltimes. Time effects areusually neglected, sothat visco-
elastic materials areexcluded from thetheories presented inthischapter.
Forthevalues ofstress usually encountered, itisaverygoodassumption
toconsider thatvolume remains constant. This alsoleads totheuseful
relation thatthesum oftheprincipal true strains isequal tozero.
61+€2+63=
Constancy ofvolume alsorequires thatPoisson's ratiomust increase from
itselastic value toavalue of0.5fortheplastic condition. Experiments
show that Poisson's ratio increases with progressive plastic strain tothis
limiting value, butfrequently theincorrect assumption ismade that
V=0.5forallvalues ofplastic strain.
Unfortunately, there isnosimple relationship between stress andstrain
intheplastic region such asexists with elastic deformation. Anobvious
simplification istoassume that plastic flowoccurs ataconstant value of
flow stress, i.e.,that there isnostrain hardening. Plasticity theory
based onideal plastic behavior hasbeendeveloped further than theories
which consider thestrain hardening ofthemetal. Onewaytotake strain
hardening intoconsideration istouseexperimental data plotted asinvari-
antstress-strain functions. Inanalyses offorming operations involving
large plastic strains, itiscommon practice toallow forstrain hardening
byusing anaverage value ofyield stress.
Theformation ofmany plasticity theories isbased onthepremise
thatthestress deviator isproportional tothestrain increment. This is
equivalent tosaying thatLode's stress andstrain parameters areequal,
^Arguments toshow thatdeformation theories ofplasticity should bevalid for
loading paths other than proportional loading have been given byB.Budiansky,
J.Appl. Mech., vol. 26,no. 2,pp.259-264, 1959.

Sec. 3-9] Elements oftheTheory ofPlasticity 69
n=V.Although deviations from Lode's relationship have beenshown
byexperiment, itappears thattheproportionality between stress devi-
atorandstrain increment isareasonably good approximation.
Toprovide additional simplification totheanalysis, itisoftenassumed
that thebody acts asarigid plastic material. With thisassumption,
allelastic strain isneglected, andthetotal strain isconsidered tobe
entirely plastic. This isasuitable assumption when theplastic strain is
large, sothattheelastic strains arenegligible bycomparison. However,
inmany problems thebody isstrained only slightly beyond theyield
stress, sothattheelastic andplastic strains areofcomparable magnitude.
Forthissituation, itisnecessary thattheelastic strains beconsidered in
theanalysis. The total strain isthen thesum oftheelastic and plastic
strain.

Hencky theory gives results inagreement with theincremental orflow
theory provided thattheprincipal axes ofstress andstrain remain coinci-
dentduring thestraining process andprovided thatproportional loading
ismaintained. TheHencky theory isnotsatisfactory forlarge defor-
mations, but itisoften used forsmall plastic strains because itoffers
certain mathematical conveniences.

dition ofylane strain. When aproblem istoodifficult foranexact three-
dimensional solution, agood indication ofthedeformation and forces
required canoften beobtained byconsideration oftheanalogous plane-
strain problem.
Since aplastic material tends todeform inalldirections, todevelop a
plane-strain condition itisnecessary toconstrain theflow inonedirec-
tion. Constraint canbeproduced byanexternal lubricated barrier, such
asadiewall (Fig. 3-7a),oritcanarisefrom asituation where onlypart
ofthematerial isdeformed andtherigid material outside theplastic
region prevents thespread ofdeformation (Fig. 3-7b).
Even though thestrain inoneoftheprincipal directions isequal to

zero forplane strain, itdoesnotfollow that there iszero stress inthis
direction. Itcanbeshown ^that forplane strain o-^=(a^+(Ty)/2 or
(Ts=(o-i+c7-2)/2. Ifthisvalue issubstituted intotheexpression forthe
VonMises criterion ofyielding, theyield criterion forplane strain becomes

(Ti—a2=—7=Co=1.15o-o (3-60)V3
Themaximum-shear-stress criterion ofyielding canbeexpressed by
(Ti—cTs=(To=2k.However, with theplane-strain condition defining
thevalue of0-3,theminimum principal stress willbe 0-2andtheshear-
stress criterion should bewritten
CTi—(72=CTo=2k (3-61)
InEq.(3-61) kistheyield stress inpure shear. However, based onthe
VonMises criterion ofyielding therelationship between thetensile yield
stress andtheyield stress inshear [Eq. (3-21)] isgiven byca=s/S k.
Therefore, Eq.(3-60) becomes o-i—0-2=2k.Thus, forplane-strain con-
ditions, thetwoyield criteria areequivalent, and itcanbeconsidered
thattwo-dimensional flow willoccur when theshear stress reaches a
critical value ofk.Equation (3-61) isequally validwhen written in
terms ofthestress deviator.

3-12. Slip-field Theory
Consider avolume element inplane strain within aplastic region ofa
body. Figure 3-8a represents thetwo-dimensional state ofstress with
respect toarbitrary cartesian coordinates. Itispossible todetermine
theprincipal planes suchthattheshear stresses vanish (Fig. 3-86). The
principal stresses aresimply functions ofthespherical component of
stress, a" ,andtheshearing stress k. fcisaconstant throughout the
plastic region ifstrain hardening isneglected, buta"varies from point to
point. Themaximum shear stress willoccur onplanes 45°tothedirec-
tion oftheprincipal stresses. Thus, thecritical shear stress kwill first
reach itsvalue onthese planes. This condition isshown inFig. 3-8c,
where itisseenthatthemaximum shear stress occurs intwoorthogonal
directions, designated aand ,8.These lines ofmaximum shear stress are
called slip lines. The sliplineshave theproperty thattheshear strain
isamaximum andthelinear strain iszerotangent totheir direction.
However, itshould becarefully noted thatthesliplines justreferred to

PLASTIC DEFORMATION
OFSINGLE CRYSTALS
4-1 .Introduction
Theprevious three chapters havebeenconcerned withthephenomeno-
logical description oftheelastic and plastic behavior ofmetals. Ithas
beenshown thatformal mathematical theories have been developed for
describing themechanical behavior ofmetals based upon thesimplifying
assumptions thatmetals arehomogeneous and isotropic. That this is
nottrueshould beobvious toanyone whohasexamined thestructure
ofmetals under amicroscope. However, forfine-grained metals sub-
jected tostatic loads within theelastic range thetheories areperfectly
adequate fordesign. Within theplastic range thetheories describe the
observed behavior, although notwith theprecision which isfrequently
desired. Forconditions ofdynamic andimpact loading weareforced,
ingeneral, torelyheavily onexperimentally determined data. Asthe
assumption thatwearedealing withanisotropic homogeneous medium
becomes lesstenable, ourability topredict thebehavior ofmetals under
stress bymeans ofthetheories ofelasticity andplasticity decreases.
Following thediscovery ofthediffraction ofXraysbymetallic crystals
byVonLaue in1912andtherealization thatmetals werefundamentally
composed ofatoms arranged inspecific geometric lattices therehavebeen
agreatmany investigations oftherelationships between atomic structure
andtheplastic behavior ofmetals. Much ofthefundamental work on
theplastic deformation ofmetals hasbeenperformed with single-crystal
specimens, soastoeliminate thecomplicating effects ofgrain boundaries
andtherestraints imposed byneighboring grains andsecond-phase parti-
cles. Techniques forpreparing single crystals have been described ina
number ofsources.^"*

discussed inthischapter. This subject willbeextended inthenextchap-
tertoaconsideration ofplastic deformation inpolycrystalline specimens.
Primary consideration willbegiven totensile deformation. Thefunda-
mental deformation behavior increep and fatigue willbecovered in
chapters specifically devoted tothese subjects. The dislocation theory,
which plays suchanimportant part inpresent-day concepts ofplastic
deformation, willbeintroduced inthischapter totheextent needed to
provide aqualitative understanding ofmodern concepts ofplastic defor-
mation. Amore detailed consideration ofdislocation theory willbe
found inChap. 6.This willbefollowed byachapter onthefunda-
mental aspects offracture andachapter oninternal friction andanelastic
effects.
4-2.Concepts oFCrystal Geometry
X-ray diffraction analysis shows thattheatoms inametal crystal are
arranged inaregular, repeated three-dimensional pattern. Theatom
arrangement ofmetals ismost simply portrayed byacrystal lattice in
which theatoms arevisualized ashard ballslocated atparticular locations
inageometrical arrangement.
Themost elementary crystal structure isthesimple cubic lattice (Fig.
4-1). This isthetype ofstructure cellfound forionic crystals, such as
NaCl and LiF, butnotforany oi'
themetals. Three mutually perpen-
dicular axes are arbitrarily placed
through oneofthecorners ofthe cell.
Crystallographic planes and direc-
tions willbespecified with respect to
these axes interms ofMiller indices.
Acrystallographic plane isspecified
interms ofthelength ofitsinter-
cepts onthethree axes, measured
from theorigin ofthecoordinate axes.
To simplify the crystallographic
formulas, thereciprocals ofthese in-
tercepts areused. They arereduced
toalowest common denominator togivetheMiller indices (hkl) ofthe
plane. Forexample, theplaneABCD inFig.4-1 isparallel tothexand
zaxesandintersects theyaxisatoneinteratomic distance ao.There-
fore,theindices oftheplane are1/oo,1/1,1/oo

Many ofthecommon metals have

oftheperfect lattice isadequate forexplaining thestructure-insensitive
properties ofmetals, forabetter understanding ofthestructure-sensitive
properties ithasbeen necessary toconsider anumber oftypes oflattice
defects. The description ofthe structure-sensitive properties then
reduces itself largely todescribing thebehavior ofthese defects.
Structure-insensitive Structure-sensitive
Elastic constants Electrical conductivity
Melting point Semiconductor properties
Density Yield stress
Specific heat Fracture strength
CoeflScient ofthermal expansion Creep strength
As issuggested bytheabove brief tabulation, practically allthe
mechanical properties arestructure-sensitive properties. Only since the
realization ofthis fact, inrelatively recent times, have really important
advances beenmade inunderstanding themechanical behavior of
materials.
Theterm defect, orimperfection, isgenerally used todescribe anydevi-
ation fromanorderly array oflattice points. When thedeviation from
theperiodic arrangement ofthelattice islocalized tothevicinity ofonly
afewatoms itiscalled apoint defect, orpoint imperfection. However,
ifthedefect extends through microscopic regions ofthecrystal, itis
called alattice imperfection. Lattice imperfections maybedivided into
linedefects andsurface, orplane, defects. Line defects obtain theirname
because theypropagate aslines orasatwo-dimensional netinthecrystal.
Theedgeandscrew dislocations thatarediscussed inthissection arethe
common linedefects encountered inmetals. Surface defects arisefrom
theclustering oflinedefects intoaplane. Low-angle boundaries and
grain boundaries aresurface defects (seeChap. 5).The stacking fault
between twoclose-packed regions ofthecrystal thathave alternate stack-
ingsequences (Sec. 4-10) isalsoasurface defect.

Notonly aredislocations important forex-
plaining the slipofcrystals, butthey arealsointimately connected with
nearly allother mechanical phenomena such asstrain hardening, the
yield point, creep, fatigue, and brittle fracture.
Thetwobasic types ofdislocations aretheedge dislocation andthe
screw dislocation. Thesimplest type ofdislocation, which wasoriginally
suggested byOrowan, Polanyi, andTaylor, iscalled theedge disloca-
tion, orTaylor-Orowan dislocation. Figure 4-7shows the slipthat
produces anedge dislocation foranelement ofcrystal having asimple

thepart ofthecrystal below theslipplane byanamount indicated by
theshaded area inFig. 4-7. Allpoints inthecrystal which were origi-
nally coincident across theslipplane havebeen displaced relative toeach

Burgers vector bofthedislocation. Forapureedge dislocation such asis
shown here, themagnitude oftheBurgers vector isequal totheatomic
spacing. Adefining characteristic ofanedge dislocation isthat its
Burgers vector isalways perpendicular tothedislocation line.
Although theexact arrangement ofatoms along AZ) isnotknown, itis
generally agreed that Fig.4-8closely represents theatomic arrangement

wehave traced thepath ofaright-

cuit ismade around thedislocation
line, theendpoint isdisplaced one

thelattice. Therefore, theatomic
planes arearranged around the
dislocation inaspiral staircase or

Slip inbccalpha ironhasbeen particularly wellstudied.^ Ithasbeen

Theshear modulus formetals isintherange 10®to10'^psi(10^^ to

able toexpect that thetheoretical shear strength ofmost metals lies
between G/10andG/50. This isstillatleast 100times greater than the
observed shear strengths ofmetal crystals. Itcanonlybeconcluded
thatamechanism other than thebodily shearing ofplanes ofatoms is

Theconcept ofthedislocation was firstintroduced toexplain thedis-
crepancy between theobserved andtheoretical shear strengths ofmetals.
Fortheconcept tobeuseful inthis field, itisnecessary todemonstrate
(1)that thepassage ofadislocation through acrystal lattice requires
farlessthan thetheoretical shear stress and (2)that themovement of
thedislocation through thelattice produces astep, orslipband, atthe
freesurface.

Toillustrate that thestress required tomove adislocation through a
crystal isverylowcompared with thetheoretical shear stress, weshall
useFig.4-16. Figure 4-16a represents theatoms intwoadjacent planes
inaperfect crystal lattice which does notcontain adislocation. The
topcurve ofthefigure represents schematically theenergy ofanatom in
thelower plane ofatoms asafunction ofitsposition relative totheupper
plane. Forthenormal arrangement ofaperfect crystal, alltheatoms
inthelower plane areatminimum positions intheenergy curve. There-
fore, ifthetoprowofatoms isdisplaced toward theright relative tothe
bottom row,eachatom encounters thesame force opposing thedisplace-
ment. This isthesituation described inSec. 4-5.Now consider the
situation when thecrystal contains adislocation (Fig. 4-166). This illus-
trates apositive edge dislocation, with theextra plane ofatoms between

Therefore, toafirstapproximation, thenetwork required toproduce

thedisplacement iszero,andthestress required tomove thedislocation
oneatomic distance isvery small.
The lattice offers essentially noresistance tothemotion ofadislocation
onlywhen thedislocation liesataposition ofsymmetry with respect to
theatoms intheslipplane. Ingeneral, asmall force, thePeierls-Nabarro
force, isneeded todrive adislocation through thelattice. While itis
well established that thevalue ofthePeierls-Nabarro force ismuch
smaller than thetheoretical shear stress foraperfect lattice, theaccu-
rate calculation ofthisforce isdifficult because itdepends strongly on
therelatively uncertain atomic arrangement atthecenter ofadislocation.
Figure 4-17, based ontheoriginal workbyTaylor,^ illustrates thatthe
movement ofadislocation results inasurface step, orslipband. The

Slip

Theextent ofslipinasingle crystal depends onthemagnitude ofthe
shearing stress produced byexternal loads, thegeometry ofthecrystal
structure, andtheorientation ofthe
active slipplanes with respect tothe
shearing stresses. Slip begins when
theshearing stress ontheslipplane in
the slip direction reaches athreshold
value called the critical resolved shear
stress. This value^isreally thesingle-
crystal equivalent oftheyield stress of
anordinary stress-strain curve. The
value ofthe critical resolved shear
stress depends chiefly oncomposition
andtemperature.
The factthat different tensile loads
arerequired toproduce slip insingle
crystals ofdifferent orientation canbe
rationalized byacritical resolved shear
stress; this w^as first recognized by

solved shear stress from asingle crystal

slipplane andthetensile axis is0,andtheangle which theslipdirec-
tionmakes with thetensile axis isX.Thearea oftheslipplane inclined
attheangle 4>willbeA/cos 0,andthecomponent oftheaxial load

Themagnitude ofthecritical resolved shear stress ofacrystal isdeter-
mined bytheinteraction ofitspopulation ofdislocations witheach other
andwith defects such asvacancies, interstitials, andimpurity atoms.
This stress is,ofcourse, greater than thestress required tomove asingle
dislocation, but itisappreciably lower than thestress required topro-
duce slipinaperfect lattice. Onthebasis ofthisreasoning, thecritical
resolved shear stress should decrease asthedensity ofdefects decreases,
provided thatthetotalnumber ofimperfections isnotzero.When the
lastdislocation iseliminated, thecritical resolved shear stress should rise
abruptly tothehigh value predicted fortheshear strength ofaperfect
crystal. Experimental evidence fortheeffect ofdecreasing defect den-
sity isshown bythefactthat the critical resolved shear stress ofsoft
metals canbereduced tolessthan one-third byincreasing thepurity. At
theother extreme, micron-diameter single-crystal filaments, orwhiskers,
canbegrown essentially dislocation-free. Tensile tests ^onthese fila-
ments have given strengths which areapproximately equal tothecalcu-
lated strength ofaperfect crystal.

method oftesting hastheadvantage that thecrystal canbeoriented
sothat themaximum shear stress occurs onanydesired slipsystem.

Theplane ofsymmetry between thetwoportions iscalled thetwinning

Inasimple lattice such asthis,eachatom inthetwinned region moves
byahomogeneous shear adistance proportional toitsdistance from the
twin plane. InFig.4-236, open circles represent atoms which have not
moved, dashed circles indicate theoriginal positions inthelattice ofatoms
which change position, and solid circles arethe final positions ofthese
atoms inthetwinned region. Note that thetwin isvisible onthe
polished surface because ofthechange inelevation produced bythe
deformation andbecause ofthedifference incrystallographic orientation
between thedeformed andundeformed regions. Ifthesurface were
polished down tosection AA,thedifference inelevation would beelimi-
nated butthetwinwould stillbevisible after etching because itpossesses
adifferent orientation from theuntwinned region.
Itshould benoted thattwinning differs from slip inseveral specific
respects. Inslip,theorientation ofthecrystal above andbelow theslip
plane isthesame after deformation asbefore, while twinning results in
anorientation difference across thetwin plane. Slip isusually considered
tooccur indiscrete multiples oftheatomic spacing, while intwinning

Twins may beproduced bymechanical deformation orastheresult

mechanical twins; thelatter arecalled annealing twins. Mechanical twins
areproduced inbccorhepmetals under conditions ofrapid rate ofload-
ing(shock loading) anddecreased temperature. Face-centered cubic
metals arenotordinarily considered todeform bymechanical twinning,
although gold-silver alloys twin fairly readily when deformed atlowtem-
perature, andmechanical twins havebeenproduced incopper bytensile

seconds, while forslipthere isadelay time ofseveral milliseconds before

more difficult toform stacking faults inabeelattice than intheclose-

X-ray diffraction." Stacking faults have been observed w^ith thin-film
electron microscopy incolumbium.^
Stacking faults occur most readily infeemetals, andtheyhave been

locations andthewider thestacking fault. Stacking-fault energies in
feemetals have been estimated ontheassumption that thestacking-
fault energy isequal totwice theenergy ofacoherent boundary ofan
annealing twin. Onthis basis, thestacking-fault energies forcopper,
nickel, andaluminum areapproximately 40,80,and200ergs/cm^. Since
thelower theenergy ofthetwinboundary, thegreater thetendency for
theformation ofannealing twins, theestimates ofstacking-fault energy
areinqualitative agreement withmetallographic observations ofthefre-
quency ofoccurrence ofannealing twins; e.g.,aluminum rarely shows
annealing twins. X-ray work hasshown that theenergy ofstacking
faults inbrass decreases with zinccontent, andthis isinagreement with
thefactthatalpha brass forms agreater number ofannealing twins than
copper.
Stacking faults enter intotheplastic deformation ofmetals inanumber
ofways. Metals withwide stacking faults strain-harden more rapidly,
twin easily onannealing, andshow adifferent temperature dependence
offlow stress from metals withnarrow stacking faults. Figure 4-26helps
toillustrate why cross slip ismore difficult inmetals withwide stacking-
fault ribbons. Because dislocations intheslipplane areextended, itis
notpossible forthem totransfer from one slipplane toanother except
atapoint where thepartial dislocations come together. Since itrequires
energy toproduce aconstriction inthestacking fault, theprocess ofcross
slip ismore difficult inametal withwide stacking faults than inametal
withnarrow stacking faults. Forexample, theactivation energy for
cross slip isabout 1evinaluminum andapproximately 10evincopper.
4-11. DeFormation Bands andKinkBands
Inhomogeneous deformation ofacrystal results inregions ofdifferent
orientation called deformation bands. When slipoccurs without restraint
inaperfectly homogeneous fashion, thesliplines areremoved bysubse-
quent polishing ofthesurface. Deformation bands, however, canbe
observed even after repeated polishing andetching because they repre-
sentregions ofdifferent crystallographic orientation. Insingle crystals,
deformation bands several millimeters widemay occur, while inpoly-
crystalline specimens microscopic observation isneeded toseethem.
Thetendency fortheformation ofdeformation bands isgreater inpoly-
crystalline specimens because therestraints imposed bythegrainbound-
ariesmake iteasy fororientation differences toarise inagrain during
deformation. Deformation bands generally appear irregular inshape
butareelongated inthedirection ofprincipal strain. The outline of
thebands isgenerally indistinct andpoorly defined, indicating ageneral

observed inboth feeandbeemetals, butnotinhepmetals.
Consideration oftheequation forcritical resolved shear stress shows
that itwillbedifficult todeform ahexagonal crystal when thebasal plane
isnearly parallel tothecrystal axis. Orowan^ found that ifacadmium

thatthey canbeconsidered tobeasimple type ofdeformation band.
Kink bands have alsobeen observed inzinc crystals tested intension,
where anonuniform distribution ofslipcanproduce abending moment
which cancause kink formation.
4-12. Strain Hardenins oFSinsle Crystals
One ofthechief characteristics oftheplastic deformation ofmetals
isthefactthat theshear stress required toproduce slipcontinuously
increases with increasing shear strain. Theincrease inthestress required
tocause slipbecause ofprevious plastic deformation isknown asstrain
hardening, orwork hardening. Anincrease inflow stress ofover 100per
centfrom strain hardening isnotunusual insingle crystals ofductile
metals.
Strain hardening iscaused bydislocations interacting witheach other
andwith barriers which impede theirmotion through thecrystal lattice.
Hardening duetodislocation interaction isacomplicated problem because
itinvolves large groups ofdislocations, and itisdifficult tospecify group
behavior inasimple mathematical way. Itisknown that thenumber
ofdislocations inacrystal increases with strain overthenumber present
intheannealed crystal. Thus, the firstrequirement forunderstanding
strain hardening wasthedevelopment ofalogical mechanism forthe
generation ofdislocations. F.C.Frank andW.T.Read conceived a

4-28, thecrystal isstrained topoint 0,unloaded, andthen reloaded in
thedirection opposite totheoriginal slipdirection. Note thatonreload-

This isbecause theback stress developed asaresult ofdislocations piling

mentwhen thedirection ofslip isreversed. Furthermore, when theslip
direction isreversed, dislocations ofopposite signcould becreated atthe
same sources thatproduced thedislocations responsible forstrain inthe
first slipdirection. Since dislocations ofopposite signattract andannihi-
lateeach other, theneteffect would beafurther softening ofthelattice.
This explains thefactthat theflowcurve inthereverse direction lies
below thecurve forcontinued flow intheoriginal direction. Thelower-
ingoftheyield stresswhen deformation inonedirection isfollowed by

after reversal ofdirection doesnot fallbelow theoriginal flowcurve for

Theexistence ofback stress and itsimportance tostrain hardening in
metals having been established, thenext step istoidentify thebarriers
todislocation motion insingle crystals. Microscopic precipitate parti-
clesandforeign atoms canserve asbarriers, butother barriers which are
effective inpure single crystals must befound. Such barriers arisefrom
thefactthat glide dislocations onintersecting slipplanes maycombine

withoneanother toproduce anewdislocation that isnotinaslipdirec-
tion. Thedislocation oflowmobility that isproduced byadislocation
reaction iscalled asessile dislocation. Since sessile dislocations donot lie
ontheslipplane oflowshear stress, they actasabarrier todislocation
motion until thestress isincreased toahighenough level tobreakdown
thebarrier. Themost important dislocation reaction, which leads to
theformation ofsessile dislocations, istheformation ofCottrell-Lomer
barriers infeemetals bysliponintersecting {111} planes.
Another mechanism ofstrain hardening, inaddition tothatduetothe
back stress resulting from dislocation pile-ups atbarriers, isbelieved to
occurwhen dislocations moving inthe slipplane cutthrough other dis-
locations intersecting theactive slipplane. The dislocations threading
through theactive slipplane areoften called adislocation forest, andthis
strain-hardening process isreferred toastheintersection ofaforest of
dislocations. Figure 4-29shows that theintersection ofdislocations
results intheformation ofjogs, oroffsets, inthedislocation line. The
jogsformed inthiscase areedge dislocations because their Burgers vec-
torsareperpendicular totheoriginal dislocation line.Anyfurther move-
ment ofthescrew dislocations along thelineAAwould require thenewly
formed edgecomponents tomove out oftheir slipplanes. Thus, the

formation ofjogs inscrew dislocations impedes their motion andmay
even lead totheformation ofvacancies and interstitials ifthejogs are
forced tomove nonconservatively. Jogs inedge dislocations donot
impede their motion. Allthese processes require anincreased expendi-
ture ofenergy, andtherefore they contribute tohardening.
Strain hardening duetoadislocation cutting process arises from short-
range forces occurring over distances lessthan 5to10interatomic dis-
tances. Thishardening canbeovercome atfinite temperatures with the

help ofthermal fluctuations, andtherefore itistemperature- andstrain-
rate-dependent. Ontheother hand, strain hardening arising from dis-
location pile-up atbarriers occurs overlonger distances, andtherefore it
isrelatively independent oftemperature and strain rate. Accordingly,
dataonthetemperature andstrain-rate dependence ofstrain hardening
canbeused^ todetermine therelative contribution ofthetwomechanisms.
When thestress-strain curves forsingle crystals areplotted asresolved
shear stress vs.shear strain, certain generalizations canbemade forall
feemetals. Following thenotation proposed bySeeger,^ theflowcurve
forpure-metal single crystals canbedivided intothree stages (Fig. 4-30).
Stage I,theregion ofeasy glide, isastage inwhich thecrystal undergoes
little strain hardening. During easy glide, thedislocations areable to
move over relatively large distances without encountering barriers. The
lowstrain hardening produced during thisstage implies thatmost ofthe
dislocations escape from thecrystal atthesurface. During easy glide,

slipalways occurs ononlyone slipsystem. Forthisreason, stage Islip
issometimes called laminar flow.
Stage IIisanearly linear part oftheflowcurve where strain hardening
increases r.apidly. Inthis stage, slipoccurs onmore than one setof
planes. The length oftheactive slip lines decreases with increasing
strain, which isconsistent with theformation ofagreater number of
Cottrell-Lomer barriers with increasing strain. During stage II,the
ratio ofthestrain-hardening coefficient (the slope ofthecurve) tothe
shear modulus isnearly independent ofstress andtemperature, and
approximately independent ofcrystal orientation andpurity. The fact
thattheslope oftheflowcurve instage IIisnearly independent oftem-
perature agrees with thetheory thatassumes thechief strain-hardening
mechanism tobepiled-up groups ofdislocations.
Stage III isaregion ofdecreasing rate ofstrain hardening. Theproc-
esses occurring during thisstage areoften called dynamical recovery. In
thisregion oftheflow curve, thestresses arehighenough sothat dis-
locations cantake part inprocesses thataresuppressed atlower stresses.
Cross slip isbelieved tobethemain process bywhich dislocations, piled
upatobstacles during stage II,canescape andreduce theinternal-strain
field. The stress atwhich stage IIIbegins, T3,isstrongly temperature-
dependent. Also, theflow stress ofacrystal strained intostage III is
more temperature-dependent than ifithadbeen strained only intostage
II.Thistemperature dependence suggests thattheintersection offorests
ofdislocations isthechief strain-hardening mechanism instage III.
Thecurve shown inFig.4-30 represents ageneral behavior forfee
metals. Certain deviations from athree-stage flow curve have been
observed. Forexample, metals with ahigh stacking-fault energy, like
aluminum, usually show only avery small stage IIregion atroom tem-
perature because theycandeform soeasily bycross slip. Theshape and
magnitude ofasingle-crystal flow curve, particularly during theearly
stages, depends upon thepurity ofthemetal, theorientation ofthe
crystal, thetemperature atwhich itistested, andtherate atwhich itis
strained. Theeasy-glide region ismuch more prominent inhepcrystals
than infeemetals. Aregion ofeasy glide intheflowcurve isfavored by
sliponasingle system, high purity, lowtemperature, absence ofsurface
oxide films, anorientation favorable forsimple slip,andamethod of
testing which minimizes extraneous bending stresses. Figure 4-31shows
that crystal orientation canhave avery strong eff"ect ontheflowcurve
offeesingle crystals. When thetensile axis isparallel toa(Oil) direc-
tion,one slipsystem iscarrying appreciably more shear stress thanany
other andtheflowcurve shows arelatively large region ofeasy glide.
When thetensile axis isclose toa(100) or(111) direction, thestress on
several slipsystems isnotvery different andtheflowcurves show rapid
rates ofstrain hardening.

PLASTIC DEFORMATION
OFPOLYCRYSTALLINE AGGREGATES
5-1.Introduction
Theprevious chapter considered theplastic deformation ofmetallic
single crystals interms ofthemovement ofdislocations andthebasic
deformation mechanisms ofslipandtwinning. Single-crystal specimens
represent themetal initsmost ideal condition. Thesimplification which
results from thesingle-crystal condition materially assists indescribing
thedeformation behavior interms ofcrystallography anddefect struc-
ture. However, with theexception ofelectronic andsemiconductor
devices, single crystals arerarely used forpractical purposes because of
limitations involving their strength, size,andproduction. Commercial
metal products areinvariably made upofatremendous number ofsmall
individual crystals orgrains. Theindividual grains ofthepolycrystalline
aggregate donotdeform inaccordance with therelatively simple laws
which describe plastic deformation insingle crystals because ofthe
restraining effect ofthesurrounding grains. Therefore, there isagap
between fundamental deformation mechanisms determined from single
crystals andtheprediction oftheplastic behavior ofapolycrystalline
aggregate from these basic concepts.
Grain boundaries exert aconsiderable influence ontheplastic-deforma-
tionbehavior ofpolycrystalline metals. Other factors which alsohave
animportant effect onmechanical properties arethepresence ofsub-
grain boundaries within the grains, solid-solution alloying additions,
and dispersion ofsecond-phase particles. These factors willeach
beconsidered inthis chapter, primarily interms ofhow they
influence thetensile-flow curve. Wherever possible, qualitative explana-
tions ofthese processes willbegiven interms ofdislocation theory.
Other topics covered inthischapter include yield-point behavior, strain
aging, coldwork, annealing, andthedevelopment ofpreferred orienta-
tions. Itwillbeappreciated thatnot allthese topics aresolely restricted
topolycrystalline materials. However, thebulk oftheexperimental
118

data onthese phenomena have been obtained from polycrystalHne
materials, andtherefore they areconsidered inthischapter.
5-2.Grain Boundaries andDeformation
Theboundaries between grains inapolycrystalline aggregate area
region ofdisturbed lattice only afewatomic diameters wide. Inthe
general case, thecrystallographic orientation changes abruptly inpassing
from onegrain tothenext across thegrain boundary. Theordinary
high-angle grainboundary represents aregion ofrandom misfit between
theadjoining crystal lattices.^ Asthedifference inorientation between
thegrains oneach side oftheboundary decreases, thestate oforder inthe
boundary increases. For thelimiting case ofalow-angle boundary
where theorientation difference across theboundary maybelessthan1°
(seeSec. 5-3),theboundary iscomposed ofaregular array ofdislocations.
Ordinary high-angle grain boundaries areboundaries ofrather high
surface energy. Forexample, agrain boundary incopper hasaninter-
facial surface energy ofabout 600ergs/cm^, while theenergy ofatwin
boundary isonlyabout 25ergs/cm^. Because oftheir highenergy, grain
boundaries serve aspreferential sites forsolid-state reactions such as
diffusion, phase transformations, and precipitation reactions. An
important point toconsider isthatthehighenergy ofagrainboundary
usually results inahigher concentration ofsolute atoms attheboundary
than intheinterior ofthegrain. Thismakes itdifficult toseparate the
puremechanical effect ofgrain boundaries onproperties fromaneffect
duetoimpurity segregation.
Grain boundaries may serve toeither strengthen orweaken ametal,
depending upon thetemperature, rate ofstrain, andthepurity ofthe
metal. Attemperatures below approximately one-half oftheabsolute
melting point, andforrelatively faststrain rates (sothatrecovery effects
arenotgreat), grain boundaries increase therate ofstrain hardening and
increase thestrength. Athightemperatures andslow strain rates (con-
ditions ofcreep deformation) deformation islocalized atthegrain
boundaries. Grain-boundary sliding andstress-induced migration can
occur, andeventually fracture takes place atthegrain boundary. The
fairly narrow temperature region inwhich thegrain boundaries become
weaker than theinterior ofthegrains, sothat fracture occurs inaninter-
granular rather than transgranular fashion, iscalled theequicohesive
temperature.
Theprincipal difference between theroom-temperature deformation of
single-crystal and polycrystalline specimens isthat polycrystalline

material exhibits ahigher rate ofstrain hardening. The stress-strain
curve forpolycrystaUine material shows nostage Ioreasy-glide region.
Only stage IIandstage IIIdeformation areobtained withpolycrystaUine
specimens. Associated with theincreased strain hardening isusually an
increase inyield stress andtensile strength. The effects ofgrainbound-
ariesonstrength areduetotwomain factors. The first isthefactthat

grain boundaries arebarriers toslip. Ofgreater importance isthefact
that therequirement forcontinuity between grains during deformation
introduces complex modes ofdeformation within theindividual grains.
Sliponmultiple-slip systems occurs very readily inpolycrystaUine
specimens.
Thefactthat sliplines stopatgrain boundaries canbereadily observed
with the light microscope. However, bymeans ofspecial etch-pit
techniques (Sec. 6-2)andhigh-magnification electron microscopy ofthin
films itispossible toestablish that dislocations pileupalong the slip
planes atthegrain boundaries (Fig. 5-1). Dislocation pile-ups produce
back stresses which oppose thegeneration ofnew dislocations atFrank-
Read sources within thegrains. With increasing applied stress moreand
more dislocations pileupatgrain boundaries. High shear stresses are
developed atthehead ofadislocation pile-up, andeventually thisbecomes
highenough toproduce dislocation movement intheneighboring grain
across theboundary. This willreduce thedislocation pile-up andmini-
mize hardening from this effect. Hardening duetodislocation pile-up

atgrain boundaries istherefore important intheearly stages ofdeforma-
tion,butnotatlarge strains. Itwillbemore effective inanhepmetal,
with only oneeasy slipplane, than infeeorbeemetals, withmany
equivalent slipplanes. Forthelatter case,nograin canbeveryunfavor-
ably oriented with respect totheapplied stress, sothat, ontheaverage,
slipcanbeinitiated inaneighboring grain atonly alittle higher stress
thanwasrequired toinitiate slipinthemost favorably oriented grains.
However, forhepmetals, theremaybeavery unfavorable orientation
difference between neighboring grains sothatanappreciably higher stress
isrequired toinitiate slip intheneighboring grain. Therefore, poly-
crystalline hepmetals show averymuch higher rate ofstrain hardening
compared with single crystals. Infeeandbccmetals thedifference inthe
flowcurve between polycrystals andsingle crystals isnotnearly sogreat.
The effect ofcrystal orientation ontheflowcurve offeesingle crystals
wasillustrated inFig.4-31. Orientations which produce many favorably
oriented slipsystems readily deform bymultiple slip. Multiple slip
always results inahigh rate ofstrain hardening. From purely geometri-
calconsiderations thegrains ofapolycrystalline metal must remain in
contact during deformation. Taylor^ hasshown that fiveindependent
slipsystems must operate ineach grain inorder tomaintain continuity.
Since slipononlytwoorthree systems, depending onorientation, occurs
formultiple slip insingle crystals, slip inpolycrystals ismore complex
than insingle crystals oriented formultiple slip. Greater strain harden-
ing isusually observed inpolycrystals than canbeaccounted foronthe
basis ofmultiple slipinsingle crystals andbygrain-boundary barriers.^
Grain sizehasameasurable effect onmost mechanical properties. For
example, atroom temperature, hardness, yield strength, tensile strength,
fatigue strength, andimpact resistance allincrease with decreasing grain
size. The effect ofgrain size islargest onproperties which arerelated to
theearly stages ofdeformation, for itisatthisstage thatgrain-boundary
barriers aremost effective. Thus, yield stress ismore dependent on
grain sizethan tensile strength. Forthelater stages ofdeformation the
strength iscontrolled chiefly bycomplex dislocation interactions occurring
within thegrains, andgrain size isnotacontrolling variable.

Theproblem ofdetermining theflowcurve ofpolycrystalline material
from single-crystal data isdifficult. Theanalyses ofthisproblem which
havebeenmade^ consist essentially inaveraging thesingle-crystal curves

Theveining inferrite grains isawell-known example ofasubstructure
resulting from theinternal stresses ac-
companying aphase transformation.
Perhaps themost general method of
producing asubstructure network is
byintroducing asmallamount ofde-
formation (from about 1to10per
cent prestrain) andfollowing thiswith
anannealing treatment torearrange
thedislocations intosubgrain bound-
aries. Theamount ofdeformation
andtemperature must belowenough
toprevent theformation ofnewgrains
byrecrystallization (see Sec. 5-12).
This process hasbeen called recrystal-
lization insitu, orpolygonization.
Theterm polygonization wasused
originally todescribe thesituation that
occurs when asingle crystal isbent to
arelatively small radius ofcurvature
andthen annealed. Bending results
intheintroduction ofanexcess number ofdislocations ofone sign.
These dislocations aredistributed along thebent-glide planes asshown
inFig. 5-5a.When thecrystal isheated, thedislocations group them-
selves intothelower-energy configuration ofalow-angle boundary by
dislocation climb. The resulting structure isapolygonlike network of
low-angle grain boundaries (Fig. 5-56).

5-4. Solid-solution Hardening
Theintroduction ofsolute atoms into solid solution inthesolvent-
atom lattice invariably produces analloywhich isstronger than thepure
metal. There aretwotypes ofsolid solutions. Ifthesolute- andsolvent
atoms areroughly similar, thesolute atoms willoccupy lattice points in
thecrystal lattice ofthesolvent atoms. This iscalled substitutional
solid solution. Ifthesolute atoms aremuch smaller than thesolvent
atoms, theyoccupy interstitial positions inthesolvent lattice. Carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, andboron aretheelements which commonly
form interstitial solid solutions.
Thefactors which control thetendency fortheformation ofsubstitu-
tional solid solutions have beenuncovered chiefly through thework of
Hume-Rothery. Ifthesizes ofthetwoatoms, asapproximately indi-
cated bythelattice parameter, differbylessthan 15percent, thesize
factor isfavorable forsolid-solution formation. When thesizefactor is
greater than 15percent, theextent ofsolid solubility isusually restricted
tolessthan 1percent. Metals which donothave astrong chemical
affinity foreachother tend toform solid solutions, while metals which are
farapart ontheelectromotive series tend toform intermetallic com-
pounds. Therelative valence ofthesolute andsolvent also isimportant.
Thesolubility ofametal withhigher valence inasolvent oflower valence
ismore extensive than forthereverse situation. Forexample, zinc is
muchmore soluble incopper than iscopper inzinc. This relative-valence
effect canberationalized toacertain extent interms oftheelectron-atom
ratio.^For certain solvent metals, thelimit ofsolubility occurs at
approximately thesame value ofelectron-atom ratio forsolute atoms of
different valence. Finally, forcomplete solid solubility over theentire
range ofcomposition thesolute andsolvent atoms must have thesame
crystal structure.
Theacquisition offundamental information about thecauses ofsolid-
solution hardening hasbeen aslow process. Early studies'' oftheincrease

ness increase varies directly with thedifference inthesize ofthesohite
andsolvent atoms, orwith thechange inlattice parameter resulting
from thesolute addition. However, itisapparent that sizefactor alone
cannot explain solid-solution hardening. Animprovement incorrelation
ofdata' results when therelative valence ofthesolute andsolvent are
considered inaddition tothelattice-parameter distortion. Theimpor-
tance ofvalence isshown inFig. 5-8,where theyield stress ofcopper
alloys ofconstant lattice parameter is
plotted against the electron-atom
ratio.'- Further results^ show that
alloys with equal grain size, lattice
parameter, and electron-atom ratio
have thesame initial yield stress, but
theflowcurves differ atlarger strains.
Systemic studies ofthe effect of
solid-solution alloying additions on
theflowcurve intension have been
made foriron,* copper,^ aluminum,^
and nickel.^ Forthecase ofironthe
solid-solution-strengthened alloy isa
power function ofthealloy addition.
Figure 5-9shows theincrease inten-
silestrength duetoalloying additions
iniron. Foragiven atomic percent ofsolute theincrease instrength
varies inversely with thelimit ofsolubility.
The distribution ofsolute atoms inasolvent lattice isnotusually
completely random. There isgrowing evidence that solute atoms group
preferentially atdislocations, stacking faults, low-angle boundaries, and
grain boundaries. However, even inaperfect lattice theatoms would
notbecompletely random. Forasolid solution ofAandBatoms, ifB
atoms tend togroup themselves preferentially around otherBatoms, thp
situation iscalled clustering. However, ifagivenBatom ispreferentially
surrounded byAatoms, the solid solution exhibits short-range order.
Thetendency forclustering orshort-range order increases with increasing
solute additions.

Itislikely that solid-solution hardening isnotsimply theresult of

willmove through thelattice almost aseasily asthrough thelattice ofa
pure metal.
Following theideas ofCottrell,^ itisgenerally held thathardening
from solute atoms results from theinteraction ofsolute atoms, inthe
form of"atmospheres," with dislocations. Since theatoms inthe
region above apositive edge dislocation arecompressed andbelow the
slipplane arestretched, thestrain energy ofdistortion canbereduced by
largeatoms collecting intheexpanded region andsmall atoms collecting
inthecompressed region. Interstitial atoms collect intheexpanded

region below the slipplane ofapositive edge dislocation. Because the
localenergy islowerwhen adislocation issurrounded byasolute atmos-
phere, ahigher stress isrequired tomake thedislocation move thanwould
berequired ifthere werenointeraction between thedislocation andthe
solute atoms. Ifthestress becomes highenough, thedislocation canbe
tornaway from itsatmosphere. When thishappens, thedislocation is
freetomove atalower stress.
Thebest-known case ofdislocation interaction wj^^h asolute-atom
atmosphere istheexistence ofanupper andlower yield point inironand
other metals. Theoccurrence ofayield point iniron isknown tobe
associated with interstitial solute atoms (seeSec. 5-5). Theupper yield
point corresponds tothestress required totear dislocations away from
theiratmospheres ofinterstitial atoms.
Anumber oftypes ofsolute-atom interaction must beconsidered in
explaining solid-solution strengthening.^ Cottrell locking duetoelastic
interaction between thesolute atoms andthedislocations, such asis
described above forinterstitial atoms, iscertainly animportant factor in
solid-solution strengthening. Inview ofthevalency effects observed in
solid solutions, electrical interaction must alsobeconsidered. However,
estimates show that electrical interaction isonlyabout one-third toone-
seventh asstrong aselastic interaction. Suzuki- haspointed outthe
existence ofathird type ofinteraction. Thermodynamic reasoning
shows that theconcentration ofsolute atoms atastacking fault willbe
greater than theaverage bulk concentration. Thus, there isa"chemical
interaction" between these regions and dislocations. While formost
alloys thischemical interaction isweaker than theinteraction force due
toCottrell locking, theforceduetochemical interaction doesnotdecrease
with increasing temperature nearly somuch asinthecase ofCottrell
locking. Fisher^ haspointed outthattheexistence ofshort-range order
orclustering inanalloy willproduce astrengthening effect. Slip ina
puremetal doesnotchange theinternal energy ofthelattice, because the
configuration ofatoms across theslipplane isthesame after slipasbefore.
Thesame situation would exist foracompletely random solid solution,
but inanalloy with short-range order slip will partially destroy the

pattern oforder across theslipplane. Aninternal surface ofincreased
energy isproduced atthe slipplane, and this results inanincrease in
thestress required toproduce slip. Thechemical interaction ofSuzuki
would beexpected topredominate over short-range order indilute solu-
tions, where thestacking-fault energy decreases rapidly withconcentra-
tion. Inconcentrated solid solutions strengthening from short-range
order should predominate.
Inabinary alloy with long-range order each oftheconstituent atoms
occupies special sites inthelattice. Ineffect, thisresults inasuperlattice
with alarger unit cellandanew crystal structure. Theinteraction of
dislocations with long-range order^ results inastrengthening effect. An
ordered crystal willcontain domains within which theorder isperfect,
butwhich areoutofstepwith theorder intheneighboring domains.
Since thedomain boundaries areahigh-energy interface, there isan
interaction between dislocations andthese antiphase boundaries. The
stress required toproduce slipvaries inversely with thedistance between
domain boundaries. Because moredomain boundaries areproduced as
slipcontinues, therate ofstrain hardening ishigher intheordered condi-
tionthan inthedisordered state. Ordered alloys with afinedomain size
(approximately 50A)arestronger than thedisordered state. Ordered
alloys with alargedomain sizegenerally have ayield stress lower than
that ofthedisordered state. This arises from thefactthatthedisloca-
tions inawell-ordered alloy aregrouped into pairs, each pairhaving a
Burgers vector twice aslarge asthat forthedisordered lattice.
5-5. Yield-point Phenomenon
Many metals, particularly low-carbon steel,show alocalized, hetero-
geneous type oftransition from elastic toplastic deformation which
produces ayield point inthestress-strain curve. Rather thanhaving a
flowcurve with agradual transition from elastic toplastic behavior, such
aswasshown inFig. 3-1,metals withayield point have aflowcurve or,
what isequivalent, aload-elongation diagram similar toFig. 5-10. The
load increases steadily with elastic strain, drops suddenly, fluctuates
about some approximately constant value ofload,andthen riseswith
further strain. Theload atwhich thesudden drop occurs iscalled the
upper yield point. Theconstant load iscalled thelower yield point, and
theelongation which occurs atconstant load iscalled theyield-point
elongation. Thedeformation occurring throughout theyield-point elon-

deformed metal, often readily visible with theeye,appears atastress
concentration such asafillet,andcoincident with theformation ofthe
band theloaddrops tothelower yield point. Theband thenpropagates
along thelength ofthespecimen, causing theyield-point elongation.
Intheusual caseseveral bands will
form atseveral points ofstress
concentration. These bands are
generally atapproximately 45°to
thetensile axis. They areusually
called Luders hands, Hartmann
lines, orstretcher strains, and this
type ofdeformation issometimes
referred toasthePiobert effect.
When several Liiders bands are
formed, theflowcurve during the
yield-point elongation willbeir-
regular, each jogcorresponding
totheformation ofanew Liiders band. After theLiiders bands have
propagated tocover theentire length ofthespecimen test section, the
flow willincrease with strain intheusual manner. Thismarks theend
oftheyield-point elongation.
Theyield-point phenomenon wasfound originally inlow-carbon steel.
Apronounced upper andlower yield pointandayield-point elongation of
over 10percentcanbeobtained wdth thismaterial under proper condi-
tions. More recently theyield point hascome tobeaccepted asageneral
phenomenon, since ithasbeenobserved inanumber ofother metals and
alloys. Inaddition toironand steel, yield points havebeenobserved in
polycrystalline molybdenum, titanium, andaluminum afloys and in
single crystals ofiron,cadmium, zinc, alpha andbeta brass, andalumi-
num. Usually theyield point canbeassociated with small amounts of
interstitial orsubstitutional impurities. Forexample, ithasbeenshown^
thatalmost complete removal ofcarbon andnitrogen from low-carbon
steelbywet-hydrogen treatment willremove theyield point. However,
onlyabout 0.001 percent ofeither ofthese elements isrequired fora
reappearance oftheyield point.
Anumber ofexperimental factors affect theattainment ofasharp
upper yield point. Asharp upper yield point ispromoted bytheuseof
anelastically rigid (hard) testing machine, very careful axial alignment
ofthespecimen, theuseofspecimens freefrom stress concentrations, high
rate ofloading, and, frequently, testing atsubambient temperatures.
If,through careful avoidance ofstress concentrations, the first Liiders

yield point canberoughly twice thelower yield point. However, itis
more usual toobtain anupper yield point 10to20percentgreater than
thelower yield point.
Cottrell's concept thattheyield point isduetotheinteraction ofsolute
atoms with dislocations wasintroduced intheprevious section. Solute
atoms diffuse todislocations because thislowers thestrain energy ofthe
crystal. Thedislocations arethenanchored inposition byanatmosphere
ofsolute atoms. Theoriginal theory^ considered that solute atoms would
segregate only toedge dislocations, because ascrew dislocation ordinarily
hasnotensile component. More recently thetheory hasbeen modified
toshow that there isastrong interaction between interstitial atoms and
screw dislocations when thelattice isnonsymmetrically deformed bythe
solute atoms sothatatensile component ofstress isdeveloped.-

interaction energy hasavalue between 0.5and 1.0ev.Asthetempera-
ture decreases, thesolute atmosphere becomes more concentrated and
below acritical temperature theatmosphere condenses into aline of
solute atoms. These atoms occupy aposition ofmaximum interaction
energy justbelow thecenter ofapositive edge dislocation running parallel
tothelength ofthedislocation.
Theshear stress required totearaway adislocation from itsatmosphere
goesthrough amaximum when plotted against displacement. Therefore,
adislocation willtend toreturn toitsatmosphere forsmall displacements,
butwhen acertain breakaway stress hasbeen reached, movement of
thedislocation becomes easier with increasing distance from theatmos-
phere. The stress atwhich thedislocations break away from their
atmosphere corresponds totheupper yield point. This releases an
avalanche ofdislocations intothe slipplane, andthese pileupatthe

tions inthat grain, and inthiswayaLiiders band propagates overthe

since thedislocations havebeen tornaway from theatmosphere ofcarbon

Yandunloaded. Ifitisreloaded after aging forseveral days atroom
temperature orseveral hours atanaging temperature like300°F, the
yield point willreappear. Moreover, theyield point willbeincreased
bytheaging treatment fromFtoZ.Thereappearance oftheyield
point isdue tothediffusion ofcarbon andnitrogen atoms tothedis-
locations during theaging period toformnewatmospheres ofinterstitials
anchoring thedislocations. Support forthismechanism isfound inthe
factthat theactivation energy forthereturn oftheyield point onaging
isingoodagreement withtheactivation energy forthediffusion ofcarbon
inalpha iron.

Nitrogen plaj^s amore important role inthestrain aging ofironthan
carbon because ithasahigher solubihty and diffusion coefficient and
produces lesscomplete precipitation during slow cooling. From a
practical standpoint itisimportant toeliminate strain aging indeep-
drawing steel because thereappearance oftheyield point canlead to
difficulties with surface markings or"stretcher strains" duetothelocal-
izedheterogeneous deformation. Tocontrol strain aging, itisusually
desirable tolower theamount ofcarbon andnitrogen insolution by
adding elements which willtake part oftheinterstitials outofsolution
intheform ofstable carbides ornitrides. Aluminum, vanadium,
titanium, columbium, andboron have been added forthispurpose.
While acertain amount ofcontrol over strain aging canbeachieved,
there isnocommercial low-carbon steelwhich iscompletely non-strain
aging. Theusual industrial solution tothisproblem istodeform the
metal topointXbyroller leveling oraskin-pass rolling operation anduse
itimmediately before itcanage.
Justastheexistence ofayield point hasbecome recognized asageneral
metallurgical phenomenon, sotheexistence ofstrain aging hascome to
berecognized inmetals other thanlow-carbon steel. Inaddition tothe
return oftheyield point andanincrease intheyield point after aging,
ithasbeen suggested^ thataserrated flowcurve andaminimum inthe
variation ofstrain-rate sensitivity withtemperature arecharacteristics
ofstrain aging. Thestrain-rate sensitivity isthechange instress required
toproduce acertain change instrain rate atconstant temperature (see
Chap. 9).The occurrence ofserrations inthestress-strain curve is
known asdiscontinuous, orrepeated, yielding. Itisalso called the
Portevin-Le Chdtelier effect. Thisphenomenon isdue tosuccessive
yielding andaging while thespecimen isbeing tested. This results from
thefactthat intherange oftemperature inwhich itoccurs thetime
required forthediffusion ofsolute atoms todislocations ismuch less
than thetime required foranordinary tension test. Discontinuous
yielding isobserved inaluminum-3 percentmagnesium alloys, duralumin,
alpha brass, andplain-carbon steel.
Forplain-carbon steeldiscontinuous yielding occurs inthetemperature
region of450to700°F. Thistemperature region isknown astheblue
brittle region because steel heated inthistemperature region shows a
decreased tensile ductility and decreased notched-impact resistance.
Thistemperature range isalsotheregion inwhich steelsshow aminimum

these facts point totherealization that blue brittleness isnotaseparate
phenomenon but isjustanaccelerated strain aging.
Thephenomenon ofstrain aging should bedistinguished from aprocess

Sec. 5-7] Plastic Deformation ofPolycrystalline Aggregates 137
known asquench aging, which occurs inlow-carbon steels. Quench
aging isatype oftrueprecipitation hardening thatoccurs onquenching
from thetemperature ofmaximum solubility ofcarbon andnitrogen in
ferrite. Subsequent aging atroom temperature, orsomewhat above,
produces anincrease inhardness andyield stress, asintheagehardening
ofaluminum alloys. Plastic deformation isnotnecessary toproduce
quench aging.
5-7. Strengthening fromSecond-phase Particles
Only arelatively smallnumber ofalloy systems permit extensive solid
solubility between two ormore elements, andonly arelatively small
hardening effect canbeproduced inmost alloy systems bysolid-solution
additions. Therefore, most commercial alloys contain aheterogeneous
microstructure consisting oftwoormore metallurgical phases. Anum-
berofdifferent conditions maybeencountered.^ Thetwophases may
beductile andpresent inthemicrostructure inrelatively massive form,
asinalpha-beta brass. Ontheother hand, thestructure may consist
ofahard, brittle phase inaductile matrix, asinspheroidized steel or
WC particles inacobalt matrix inacemented carbide cutting tool.
Thestrengthening produced bysecond-phase particles isusually addi-
tive tothesolid-solution strengthening produced inthematrix. For
two-phase alloys produced byequilibrium methods, theexistence ofa
second phase ensures maximum solid-solution hardening because its
presence resulted from supersaturation ofthecontinuous phase. More-
over, thepresence ofsecond-phase particles inthecontinuous matrix
phase results inlocalized internal stresses which modify the plastic
properties ofthecontinuous phase. Many factors must beconsidered
foracomplete understanding ofstrengthening from second-phase par-
ticles. These factors include the size, shape, number, anddistribution
ofthesecond-phase particles, thestrength, ductility, andstrain-hardening
behavior ofthematrix andsecond phase, thecrystallographic fitbetween
thephases, andtheinterfacial energy and interfacial bonding between
thephases. Itisalmost impossible tovary these factors independently
inexperiments, and itisvery difficult tomeasure many ofthese quantities
withanydegree ofprecision. Therefore, ourexisting knowledge ofthe
effect ofsecond phases onmechanical properties ismainly empirical and
incomplete.
Inamultiphase alloy, each phase contributes certain things tothe
over-all properties oftheaggregate. Ifthecontributions from each

example, thedensity ofatwo-phase alloy willbeequal tothesum ofthe
volimie fraction ofeach phase times itsdensity. However, forthe
structure-sensitive mechanical properties theproperties oftheaggregate
aregenerally influenced byinteraction between thetwophases. Two
simple hypotheses maybeused tocalculate theproperties ofatwo-phase
alloyfrom theproperties oftheindividual phases. Ititisassumed that

approximations, andthestrengths ofalloys containing twoductile phases

phase ispresent, most ofthedeformation willcontinue inthesofter phase.
Atlarge deformations flow ofthematrix willoccur around theparticles
oftheharder phase. Ifthevolume fraction oftheharder phase isless
than about 0.3,thesoftphase deforms more than thehard phase for
reductions ofupto60percent. Atgreater reductions thetwophases
deform more uniformly. When thephases arepresent inabout equal
amounts, theydeform toabout thesame extent.^
Themechanical properties ofanalloy consisting ofaductile phase and
ahard brittle phase willdepend onhowthebrittle phase isdistributed in
themicrostructure. Ifthebrittle phase ispresent asagrain-boundary
envelope, asinoxygen-free copper-bismuth alloys orhypereutectoid
steel, thealloy isbrittle. Ifthebrittle phase isintheform ofdiscon-
tinuous particles atgrain boundaries, aswhen oxygen isadded tocopper-
bismuth alloys orwith internally oxidized copper and nickel, thebrittle-
ness ofthealloy isreduced somewhat. When thebrittle phase ispresent
asafinedispersion uniformly distributed throughout thesofter matrix,
acondition ofoptimum strength andductility isobtained. This isthe
situation inheat-treated steelwithatempered martensitic structure.
Thestrengthening produced byafinely dispersed insoluble second
phase inametallic matrix isknown asdispersion hardening. Avery
similar strengthening phenomenon, precipitation hardening, orageharden-
ing, isproduced bysolution treating andquenching analloy inwhich a
second phase isinsolid solution attheelevated temperature butprecipi-
tates upon quenching andaging atalower temperature. The age-
hardening aluminum alloys andcopper-beryllium alloys arecommon
examples. Forprecipitation hardening tooccur, thesecond phase must
besoluble atanelevated temperature butmust exhibit decreasing
solubility with decreasing temperature. Bycontrast, thesecond phase
indispersion-hardening systems hasvery little solubility inthematrix,
even atelevated temperatures. Usually there isatomic matching, or
coherency, between thelattices oftheprecipitate andthematrix, while in
dispersion-hardened systems there generally isnocoherency between the
second-phase particles andthematrix. Therequirement ofadecreasing
solubility withtemperature places alimitation onthenumber ofuseful
precipitation-hardening alloy systems. Ontheother hand, itisatleast
theoretically possible toproduce analmost infinite number ofdispersion-
hardened systems bymixing finely divided metallic powders andsecond-
phase particles (oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, etc.)andconsolidating
thembypowder metallurgy techniques. Advantage hasbeen taken of
thismethod toproduce dispersion-hardened systems which arethermally
stable atveryhightemperatures. Because ofthefinely dispersed second-
phase particles these alloys aremuch more resistant torecrystallization

andgrain growth than single-phase alloys. Because there isvery little
solubility ofthesecond-phase constituent inthematrix, theparticles
resist growth oroveraging toamuch greater extent than thesecond-
phase particles inaprecipitation-hardening system.
Theformation ofacoherent precipitate inaprecipitation-hardening
system, such asAl-Cu, occurs inanumber ofsteps. After quenching
from solid solution thealloy contains regions ofsolute segregation, or
clustering. Guiner andPreston firstdetected this local clustering with
special X-ray techniques, andtherefore thisstructure isknown asaGP
zone. The clustering mayproduce local strain, sothatthehardness of
GP[1] ishigher than forthesolid
solution. With additional aging

herent precipitate produces anin-
creased strain field inthematrix andafurther increase inhardness.
With stillfurther aging theequilibrium phase CUAI2, or0,isformed from
thetransition lattice Q'.These particles arenolonger coherent with the
matrix, and therefore thehardness islow^er than atthestage when
coherent Q'was present. Formost precipitation-hardening alloys the
resolution with thelight microscope ofthe first precipitate occurs after
theparticles arenolonger coherent with thematrix. Continued aging
beyond thisstage produces particle growth andfurther decrease inhard-
ness. Figure 5-13 illustrates theway inwhich strength varies withaging
time orparticle size. Thesequence ofevents intheAl-Cu system is
particularly complicated. Although other precipitation-hardening sys-
temsmay nothave somany stages, itisquitecommon foracoherent
precipitate toformandthen losecoherency when theparticle grows toa
critical size.
Metallographic observations ofdeformation mechanisms inprecipita-
tion-hardening systems require very careful techniques.^ Inthe as-
quenched condition slipbands arebroad andwidely spaced. Asaging
continues, the slipbands become finerandmore closely spaced. As
GP[2] zones formandthealloy proceeds toward peak hardness, fewer
andfewer slipbands canbeobserved with theelectron microscope.

When thealloy begins tooverage andcoherency breaks down, theslip
lines oncemore canbeobserved. Electron-microscope studies have
shown that dislocation motion isimpeded byfullyandpartially coherent
precipitates, buteventually thedislocations shear Ihrouj^h theparticles.
Foranoncoherent precipitate the slip lines donotcutthrough the
particles. Instead, thedislocation linesbend toavoid the particles,
probably byaprocess ofcross slip.^
Thedegree ofstrengthening resulting from second-phase dispersions
depends upon thedistribution ofparticles inthesoftmatrix. Inaddi-
tiontoshape, thesecond-phase dispersion canbedescribed byspecifying
thevolume fraction, average particle diameter, andmean interparticle
spacing. These factors are allinterrelated sothatonefactor cannot be
changed without affecting theothers (seeProb. 5-5). Forexample, for
agiven volume fraction ofsecond phase, reducing theparticle size
decreases theaverage distance between particles. Foragiven size
particle, thedistance between particles decreases withanincrease in
thevolume fraction ofsecond phase. Quantitative relationships between
strength andthegeometrical factors have notbeen determined toany
extent forreal alloys.
However, thequalitative aspects ofdispersion hardening canbecon-
sidered, thecommon situation ofcarbide particles inferrite being used as
anexample. Ingeneral, thehardness andstrength increase withcarbon
content orvolume fraction ofthecarbide phase. Further, foragiven
carbon content, thestrength willbehigher forafinecarbide spacing
thanwithacoarse interparticle spacing. Particle shape hasalessimpor-
tant effect ontensile properties, although foragiven volume fraction of
carbides lamellar carbides willbestronger than spheroidized carbides.
Particle shape isofgreater importance innotched impact, where a
spheroidized structure willbetougher than alamellar structure.
Detailed quantitative metallography onsteels heat-treated toprovide
different interparticle spacings hasshown the relationship between
strength andstructure. Gensamer andcoworkers- found that theflow
stress, atatrue strain of0.2,wasinversely proportional tothelogarithm

Orowan's relationship between strength and particle spacing hasbeen
experimentally confirmed formost systems containing overaged ornon-
coherent particles. TheFisher, Hart, andPryequation forthecontribu-
tion tostrain hardening from dispersed particles alsoappears tobe
approximately verified. According toEq.(5-10) theshear strength ofa
dispersion-hardened alloy willhave amaximum valuewhenAhasavalue
thatmakes ite(}ually likely that dislocations willpassbetween the
particles orcutthrough them. Asthedistance between particles is
increased, the critical radius ofcurvature isincreased and thestress
required tobend thedislocation line isdecreased. When thedistance
between particles isdecreased, thedislocation linebecomes more rigid.
Itisdifficult forthedislocation line tobend sharply enough topass
between theparticles, andsoitshears through them instead. There are
indications that intheregion ofsmall particle spacing theyield stress isa
direct function oftheradius oftheparticles.
5-8.Hardening Due toPoint Defects
Vacancies and interstitials areproduced bythebombardment ofa
metal with high-energy nuclear particles. Thebombardment ofthe
lattice with fastneutrons having energies upto2million evknocks atoms
into interstitial positions inthe lattice, andvacancies are leftbehind.
Neutron irradiation increases thehardness and yield strength ofmost
metals. Incopper single crystals adose of10'^neutrons perscjuare
centimenter increases theyield strength byafactor of10andchanges
thedeformation characteristics sothatthey aresimilar toalpha brass.'
Inmetals which show aductile-to-brittle transition, such assteel, pro-
longed neutron irradiation canappreciably raise thetransition tempera-
ture. Thestructural changes producing radiation hardening andradia-
tiondamage aredifficult tostudy indetail because atleasttwopoint
defects areacting simultaneously. Interstitials areevenmore mobile
than vacancies, sothat quite lowtemperatures arerequired toprevent
them from interacting with other lattice defects.
Asituation inwhich theonly point defects arevacancios canbe
produced byrapidly quenching apure metal (sothat there canbeno

point. Atroom temperature orbelow themetal contains asuper-
saturated solution ofmost ofthevacancies that existed inequilibrium at
thehigher temperature. Vacancy concentrations ofuptoabout 10~^
canbeachieved byquenching. Softmetals, such asaluminum, copper,
and zinc,canbehardened byintroducing arandomly distributed popula-
tion ofvacancies inthisway. Quench hardening results inanincrease
inyield stress andadecrease intherate ofstrain hardening, just asis
produced byradiation hardening. Therefore, adispersion ofpoint
defects canproduce hardening, byanalogy with thehardening produced
byadispersion ofsecond-phase particles. Themechanism bywhich this
occurs isnotyetestablished. There issome evidence that atthisstage
the single vacancies have migrated into clusters. Agreater quench
hardening results ifanaging treatment isinterposed between thequench
andthemeasurement ofthetensile properties. Itislikely thattheaging
permits thevacancies tomigrate todislocations, where they interact and
impede themovement ofdislocations (seeSec. 6-12). Much remains to
belearned about theinteraction ofpoint defects witheachotherandwith
linedefects andhowthese interactions affect themechanical properties.
Plastic deformation produces point defects, chiefly vacancies. These
point defects arecreated bytheintersection ofdislocations, andtherefore,
adiscussion ofthistopic willbedeferred untilChap. 6.Vacancy forma-
tionappears tobeparticularly important inthefatigue ofmetals, and it

peratures vacancies become veryimportant incontrolling diffusion andin

creep ofmetals, andthey willbeconsidered ingreater detail inChap. 13.
5-9. Strain Hardening andColdWork
InChap. 4strain hardening wasattributed totheinteraction ofdis-
locations with other dislocations andwith other barriers totheirmotion
through thelattice. Solong assliptakes place ononly asingle setof
parallel planes, aswith single crystals ofhepmetals, onlyasmallamount
ofstrain hardening occurs. However, evenwith single crystals extensive
easy glide isnotageneral phenomenon, andwith polycrystalline speci-
mens itisnotobserved. Because ofthemutual interference ofadjacent
grains inapolycrystalline specimen multiple slipoccurs readily, andthere
isappreciable strain hardening. Plastic deformation which iscarried out
inatemperature region andover atime interval such that thestrain
hardening isnotrelieved iscalled coldwork.
Plastic deformation produces anincrease inthenumber ofdislocations,

>ec.5-9] Plastic Deformation ofPolycrystallinc Asgregates 147
which byvirtue oftheir interaction results inahigher state ofinternal
stress. Anannealed metal contains about 10®to10^dislocations per
square centimeter, while aseverely plastically deformed metal contains
about 10^^dislocations persquare centimeter. Strain hardening orcold
work canbereadily detected byX-ray diffraction, although detailed
analysis oftheX-ray patterns interms ofthestructure ofthecold-worked
state isnotusually possible. InLaue patterns coldwork produces a

method andmore widespread application ofthetechnique willresult in
better understanding ofthestructure ofcold-worked metal.

opedfrommicrobeam X-ray studies^ andfrom electron microscopy of

energy isstored inthelattice asanincrease ininternal energy. Reported
values ofstored energy^ range fromabout 0.01to1.0cal/g ofmetal. The
magnitude ofthestored energy increases with themelting point ofthe
metal andwith solute additions. Foragiven metal theamount ofstored
energy depends onthetype ofdeformation process, e.g.,wiredrawing vs.
tension. Thestored energy increases with strain uptoalimiting value
corresponding tosaturation. Itincreases with, decreasing temperature of
deformation. Very careful calorimeter measurements arerequired to
measure thesmallamounts ofenergy stored bycoldworking.
Themajor part ofthestored energy isduetothegeneration andinter-
action ofdislocations during coldworking. Vacancies account forpart
ofthestored energy formetals deformed atverylowtemperature. How-
ever, vacancies aresomuch more mobile than dislocations thatthey
readily escape frommost metals deformed atroom temperature. Stack-
ingfaults andtwin faults areprobably responsible forasmall fraction of
thestored energy. Areduction inshort-range order during thedeforma-
tion ofsolid solutions may alsocontribute tostored energy. Elastic
strain energy accounts foronly aminor part ofthemeasured stored
energy.
Strain hardening orcoldworking isanimportant industrial process that
isused toharden metals oralloys thatdonotrespond toheattreatment.

parameters with increasing amount ofcoldwork. Since inmost cold-
working processes oneortwodimensions ofthemetal arereduced atthe
expense ofanincrease intheother dimensions, coldwork produces
elongation ofthegrains intheprincipal direction ofworking. Severe
deformation produces areorientation ofthegrains into apreferred
orientation (Sec. 5-11). Inaddition tothechanges intensile properties
shown inFig.5-18, coldworking produces changes inother physical prop-
erties. There isusually asmall decrease indensity oftheorder ofafew
tenths ofapercent,anappreciable decrease inelectrical conductivity due
toanincreased number ofscattering centers, andasmall increase inthe
thermal coefficient ofexpansion. Because oftheincreased internal energy
ofthecold-worked state chemical reactivity isincreased. This leads toa
general decrease incorrosion resistance and incertain alloys introduces
thepossibility ofstress-corrosion cracking.
5-10. Bauschinger Effect
Inanearlier discussion ofthestrain hardening ofsingle crystals itwas
shown thatgenerally alower stress isrequired toreverse thedirection of
sliponacertain slipplane than to
continue slipintheoriginal direction.
Thedirectionality ofstrain hardening
iscalled theBauschinger effect. Fig-
ure5-19 isanexample ofthetype
ofstress-strain curve that isobtained
when the Bauschinger effect is
considered.
The initial yield stress ofthema-
terial intension isA. Ifthesame
ductile material were tested incom-
pression, theyield strength would be
approximately thesame, pointBon
thedashed curve. Now, consider
that anew specimen isloaded in
tension past thetensile yield stress to
Calong thepathOAC. Ifthespeci-
men isthenunloaded, itwillfollow the
pathCD, small elastic-hysteresis effects being neglected. Ifnow a
compressive stress isapplied, plastic flow willbegin atthestress corre-
sponding topoint E,which isappreciably lower thantheoriginal compres-
sive yield stress ofthematerial. While theyield stress intension was
increased bystrain hardening fromAtoC,theyield stress incompression
was decreased. This istheBauschinger effect. Thephenomenon isFig.5-19.Bauschinger effect andhys-
teresis loop.

150 Metallurgical Fundamentals [Chap. 5
reversible, forhadthespecimen originally been stressed plastically in
compression, theyield stress intension would have been decreased.
Oneway ofdescribing theamount ofBauschinger effect isbytheBau-
schinger strain 13(Fig. 5-19). This isthedifference instrain between the
tension andcompression curves atagiven stress.
Iftheloading cycle inFig.5-19 iscompleted byloading further in
compression topoint F,then unloading, andreloading intension, a
mechanical-hysteresis loop isobtained. Theareaunder theloop will
depend upon theinitial overstrain beyond theyield stress andthenumber
oftimes thecycle isrepeated. Ifthecycle isrepeated many times, failure
byfatigue islikely tooccur.
Orowan^ haspointed outthat, iftheBauschinger effect isduesolely to
theeffect ofback stresses, theflowcurve after reversal ofstrain ought
always tobesofter than theflowcurve fortheoriginal direction ofstrain.
However, not allmetals show apermanent softening after strain reversal,
andthose which doshow only asmall effect. Therefore, Orowan con-
siders thattheBauschinger effect canbeexplained bythesamemecha-
nismwhich heproposed fordispersion hardening (Sec. 5-7). Obstacles
todislocation motion areconsidered tobeother dislocations, inclusions,
precipitate particles, etc.The stress required tomove adislocation
through these obstacles isgiven approximately byEq. (5-10). Fora
given shear stress adislocation line willmove over theslipplane until it
meets arow ofobstacles that arestrong enough toresist shearing and
closeenough toresist thedislocation loopfrom squeezing between them.
Now,when theload isremoved, thedislocation linewillnotmove appreci-
ably unless there areveryhighback stresses. However, when thedirec-
tion ofloading isreversed, thedislocation linecanmove anappreciable
distance atalowshear stress because theobstacles totherear ofthedis-
location arenotlikely tobesostrong andclosely packed asthoseimme-
diately infront ofthedislocation. Asthedislocation linemoves, it
encounters, ontheaverage, stronger and closer obstacles, sothat the
shear stress continuously increases with strain. This isinagreement
with thetype offlowcurve usually observed fortheBauschinger effect.
5-11. Preferred Orientation
Ametal which hasundergone asevere amount ofdeformation, asin
rolling orwiredrawing, willdevelop apreferred orientation, ortexture, in
which certain crystallographic planes tend toorient themselves inapre-
ferred manner with respect tothedirection ofmaximum strain. The
tendency fortheslipplanes inasingle crystal torotate parallel totheaxis

ofprincipal strain wasconsidered intheprevious chapter. Thesame
situation exists inapolycrystalline aggregate, butthecomplex inter-
actions between themultiple slipsystems makes analysis ofthepoly-
crystalline situation much more difficult. Since theindividual grains in
apolycrystalline aggregate cannot rotate freely, lattice bending and
fragmentation willoccur.
Preferred orientations aredetermined byX-ray methods. TheX-ray
pattern ofafine-grained randomly oriented metal willshow rings corre-
sponding todifferent planes where theangles satisfy thecondition for
Bragg reflections. Ifthegrains arerandomly oriented, theintensity of
therings willbeuniform for allangles, but ifapreferred orientation
exists, therings willbebroken upintoshort arcs, orspots. Thedense
areas oftheX-ray photograph indicate theorientation ofthepoles ofthe
planes corresponding tothediffraction ring inquestion. Theorientation
ofthegrains ofaparticular crystallographic orientation with respect to
theprincipal directions ofworking isbestshown bymeans ofapole
figure. Foradescription ofthemethods ofdetermining pole figures and
acompilation ofpole figures describing thedeformation textures inmany
metals, thereader isreferred toBarrett.^ Thecurrent useofGeiger-
counter X-ray diffractometer techniques'- hasmade itpossible todeter-
mine pole figures with greater accuracy and lesslabor than with older
filmmethods.
Apreferred orientation canbedetected withXrays afterabout a20to
30percentreduction incross-sectional areabycoldworking. Atthis
stage ofreduction there isappreciable scatter intheorientation ofindi-
vidual crystals about theideal orientation. The scatter decreases with
increasing reduction, until atabout 80to90percentreduction thepre-
ferred orientation isessentially complete. Thetype ofpreferred orienta-
tion, ordeformation texture, which isdeveloped depends primarily on
thenumber andtype ofslipsystems available andontheprincipal
strains. Other factors whichmaybeimportant arethetemperature of
deformation andthetype oftexture present prior todeformation.
Thesimplest deformation texture isproduced bythedrawing orrolling
ofawire orrod. This isoften referred toasafiber texture because ofits
similarity tothearrangement innaturally fibrous materials. Itis
important tonotethatadistinction should bemade between thecrystal-

fibering areimportant factors inproducing directional mechanical
properties ofplastically worked metal shapes such assheet and rods.
This willbediscussed further inChap. 9.
Inanideal wire texture adefinite crystallographic direction lies
parallel tothewire axis,andthetexture issymmetrical around thewireor
fiber axis. Several types ofdeviations from theideal texture areobserved.
Inface-centered cubic metals adouble fiber texture isusually observed.
Thegrains have either (111) or(100) parallel tothewire axisandhave
random orientations around theaxis.^Body-centered cubic metals have a
simple (110)wire texture. Thewiretexture inhepmetals isnotsosimple.
Formoderate amounts ofdeformation thehexagonal axis(0001) ofzinc is
parallel tothefiber axis,while forsevere deformation thehexagonal axis is
about 20°from thewire axis. Formagnesium and itsalloys (1010) is
parallel tothewire axis fordeformation below 450°C,while above this
temperature (2110) isparallel tothefiber axis.
Thedeformation texture ofasheet produced byrolling isdescribed by
thecrystallographic planes parallel tothesurface ofthesheet aswellas
thecrystallographic directions parallel tothedirection ofrolling. There
isoften considerable deviation from theideal texture, sothatpole figures
areuseful fordescribing thedegree ofpreferred orientation.^ Precision
determination oftherolling texture infeemetals hasshown that the
texture maybedescribed bestbythe{123} planes lying parallel tothe
plane ofthesheet withthe(112) direction parallel totherolling direction.^
Thistexture changes tothemorecommon {110} (112) texture bytheaddi-
tion ofsolid-solution alloying elements. Inbccmetals the{100} planes
tend tobeoriented parallel totheplane ofthesheet with the(110) direc-
tionwithin afewdegrees oftherolling direction. Forhepmetals the
basal plane tends tobeparallel with therolling plane with (2110) aligned
intherolling direction.
The preferred orientation resulting from deformation isstrongly
dependent ontheslipandtwinning systems available fordeformation, but
itisnotgenerally affected byprocessing variables such asdieangle, roll
diameter, rollspeed, andreduction perpass. Thedirection offlow isthe
most important process variable. Forexample, thesame deformation
texture isproduced whether arod ismadebyrolling, drawing, orswaging.

anisotropy inmechanical properties. Although theindividual grains ofa
metal areanisotropic with respect tomechanical properties, when these
grains arecombined inarandom fashion intoapolycrystalline aggregate
themechanical properties oftheaggregate tend tobeisotropic. How-
ever, thegrain alignment that accounts forthepreferred orientation
again introduces ananisotropy inmechanical properties. Different
mechanical properties indifferent directions canresult inuneven response
ofthematerial during forming andfabrication operations.

undeformed metal. Therefore, there isatendency forstrain-hardened

metal torevert tothestrain-free condition. With increasing temperature
thecold-worked statebecomes moreandmore unstable. Eventually the
metal softens andreverts toastrain-free condition. Theover-all process
bywhich thisoccurs isknown asannealing.' Annealing isveryimpor-
tantcommercially because itrestores theductility toametal thathas
been severely strain-hardened. Therefore, byinterposing annealing
operations after severe deformation itispossible todeform most metals to
avery great extent.
Theover-all process ofannealing canbedivided intothree fairly distinct
processes, recovery, recrystallization, andgrain growth. Figure 5-20 will
help todistinguish between these processes. Recovery isusually defined
astherestoration ofthephysical properties ofthecold-worked metal
without any observable change inmicrostructure. Electrical con-

andlattice strain, asmeasured withXrays, isappreciably reduced. The

recrystallization. Recrystallization isthereplacement ofthe cold-
worked structure byanew setofstrain-free grains. Recrystallization is
readily detected bymetallographic methods and isevidenced bya
decrease inhardness orstrength andanincrease inductility. Thedensity
ofdislocations decreases considerably onrecrystallization, and alleffects
ofstrain hardening areeliminated. Thestored energy ofcoldwork isthe

progression from acold-worked microstructure toafine recrystallized

Recrystallization isthereversion bythermal activation ofthecold-
worked structure toitsoriginal strain-free condition. Asthetemperature
isincreased, thedislocation networks tend tocontract andtheregions
ofinitially lowdislocation density begin togrow. The fraction ofthe

Sixmain variables influence recrystallization behavior. They are
(1)amount ofprior deformation, (2)temperature, (3)time, (4)initial
grain size, (5)composition, and (6)amount ofrecovery orpolygonization
prior tothestart ofrecrystallization. Because thetemperature atwhich
recrystallization occurs depends ontheabove variables, itisnotafixed
temperature inthesense ofamelting temperature. Forpractical con-
siderations arecrystallization temperature canbedefined asthetem-
perature atwhich agiven alloy inahighly cold-worked state completely
recrystallizes in1hr.The relationship oftheabove variables tothe
recrystallization process canbesummarized^ asfollows.
1.
Aminimum amount ofdeformation isneeded tocause recrystalliza-
tion.
2.Thesmaller thedegree ofdeformation, thehigher thetemperature
required tocause recrystallization.
3.Increasing theannealing time decreases the recrystallization
temperature. However, temperature isfarmore important than time.
Doubling theannealing time isapproximately equivalent toincreasing
theannealing temperature 10°C.
4.The finalgrain sizedepends chiefly onthedegree ofdeformation and
toalesser extent ontheannealing temperature. Thegreater thedegree
ofdeformation andthelower theannealing temperature, thesmaller the
recrystallized grain size.
5.The larger theoriginal grain size, thegreater theamount ofcold
work recjuired toproduce anequivalent recrystallization temperature.
6.The recrystallization temperature decreases with increasing purity
ofthemetal. Solid-solution alloying additions always raise therecrystal-
lization temperature.
7.Theamount ofdeformation required toproduce equivalent recrystal-
lization behavior increases with increased temperature ofworking.
8.Foragiven reduction incross section, different metalworking proc-
esses, such asrolling, drawing, etc.,produce somewhat different effective

deformations. Therefore, identical recrystallization behavior maynotbe
obtained.
Because thedriving force forgrain growth isappreciably lower than
thedriving force forrecrystallization, atatemperature atwhich recrystal-
lization occurs readily grain growth willoccur slowly. However, grain
growth isstrongly temperature-dependent, andagrain-coarsening region
willsoon bereached inwhich thegrains increase insizevery rapidly.
Grain growth isinhibited considerably bythepresence ofafinedispersion
ofsecond-phase particles, which restricts grain-boundary movement.
Fortheusual type ofgrain growth, where thegrains increase insizeuni-
formly, theory predicts that atagiven temperature thegrain size Z>ata

However, most experimental data agree bestwithanequation
where nvaries from about 0.2to0.5,depending onthemetal andthe
temperature.
Under certain conditions, some ofthegrains ofafine-grained recrystal-
lizedmetal willbegin togrow rapidly attheexpense oftheother grains
when heated atahigher temperature. Thisphenomenon isknown as
exaggerated, orabnormal, grain growth. Thedriving force forexaggerated
grain growth isthedecrease insurface energy, notstored energy, but
because thephenomenon shows kinetics similar tothose ofrecrystalliza-
tion itisoften called secondary recrystallization.
5-13.Annealing Textures
The recrystallization ofacold-worked metalmayproduce apreferred
orientation which isdifferent from that existing inthedeformed metal.
This iscalled anannealing texture, orrecrystallization texture. Anout-
standing example isthecube texture incopper, where the {100}plane lies
parallel totherolling plane with a(001) direction parallel tothedirection
ofrolling. The existence ofarecrystallization texture depends ona
preferential orientation ofthenuclei oftherecrystallized grains. Anneal-
ing-texture formation depends onanumber ofprocessing variables, the
amount andtype ofdeformation preceding annealing, thecomposition of
thealloy, thegrain size, theannealing temperature andtime, andthe
preferred orientation produced bythedeformation.
Generally thefactors which favor theformation ofafinerecrystallized
grain sizealsofavor theformation ofanessentially random orientation of
recrystallized grains. Moderate cold reductions andlowannealing

temperatures arebeneficial. Agoodway ofminimizing arecrystalliza-
tiontexture isfirsttoproduce astrong preferred orientation byaheavy
initial reduction andthen useahighanneaUng temperature. This isfol-
lowed byenough added coldreduction tobreak upthisorientation and
produce afinerecrystallized grain sizeatalowtemperature.
Sometimes theformation ofastrong recrj stallization texture isbene-
ficial. Thebestexample iscube-oriented silicon-iron transformer sheet,
where thegrains areoriented intheeasy direction ofmagnetization. To
obtain anearly perfect recrystallization texture, itisnecessary toproduce
ahighdegree ofpreferred orientation inthecold-worked metal. This is
followed bylongannealing atahightemperature toallow selective grain
growth toproduce astrong texture.

DISLOCATION THEORY
6-1. Introduction
Adislocation isthelinear lattice defect that isresponsible fornearly
allaspects ofthe plastic deformation ofmetals. This concept was
introduced inChap. 4,where thegeometry ofedgeandscrew dislocations
waspresented forthecase ofasimple cubic lattice. Itwasshown that
theexistence ofadislocationlike defect isnecessary toexplain thelow
values ofyield stress observed inreal crystals. Ageneral picture has
beengiven oftheinteraction ofdislocations with foreign atoms, precipitate
particles, andother dislocations. Thishasbeenused togiveaqualitative
picture ofthestrain hardening ofsingle crystals and, inChap. 5,tohelp
explain solid-solution hardening, dispersed-phase hardening, yield-point
behavior, andstrain aging.
Thischapter isintended topresent amore complete andsomewhat more
rigorous treatment ofdislocation theory. Therapidly improving tech-
niques fordetecting dislocations inrealmetals areconsidered, andexperi-
mental evidence tosupport thetheory isgiven wherever possible insub-
sequent portions ofthechapter. The effect ondislocation behavior of
considering real fee,bcc, orhepcrystal structures isconsidered. Inter-
action ofdislocations with other dislocations, vacancies, and foreign
atoms isdiscussed insome detail. Theimportant problem ofdislocation
multiplication bymeans oftheFrank-Read source isgiven particular
attention.
6-2.Methods ofDetectins Dislocations
Theconcept ofthedislocation wasproposed independently byTaylor,
Orowan, andPolan^d^ in1934, buttheidea layrelatively undeveloped
until theendofWorldWar IIThere followed aperiod ofapproximately
10years inwhich thetheory ofdislocation behavior wasdeveloped

extensively andapplied topractically every aspect oftheplastic deforma-
tion ofmetals. Because there werenoreally reliable methods fordetect-
ingdislocations inrealmaterials, itwasnecessary tobuildmuch ofthis
theory onthebasis ofindirect observations ofdislocation behavior.
Fortunately, since 1955improved techniques havemade itpossible to
observe dislocations asthey actually exist inmany materials. Today,
there isnoquestion astotheexistence oflattice defects with properties
similar tothose ascribed tothedislocation. Many ofthetheoretical
predictions havebeenconfirmed byexperiment, while others havehadto
bemodified andsome abandoned. Undoubtedly, better experimental
techniques, applicable toawider variety ofmaterials, willbedeveloped
inthefuture. Asmore information isobtained ondislocation behavior in
realmaterials, there certainly willbeother changes incurrent concepts of
dislocation theory.
Theresolving power ofthebestelectron microscope would have tobe
improved byafactor of5to10inorder toobserve directly thedistortion
oftheindividual lattice planes around adislocation inametal crystal.^
Practically alltheexperimental techniques fordetecting dislocations
utilize thestrain fieldaround adislocation toincrease itseffective size.
These experimental techniques canberoughly classified intotwo cate-
gories, those involving chemical reactions with thedislocation, andthose
utilizing thephysical changes atthe site ofadislocation.- Chemical
methods include etch-pit techniques andprecipitation techniques. Meth-
odsbased onthephysical structure atadislocation siteinclude trans-
mission electron microscopy ofthinfilmsandX-ray diffraction techniques.
Thesimplest chemical technique istheuseofanetchant which forms
apitatthepoint where adislocation intersects thesurface. Etch pits
areformed atdislocation sitesbecause thestrain fieldsurrounding the
dislocation causes preferential chemical attack. Agreat deal ofinforma-
tionabout dislocation behavior intheionic crystal LiFhasbeenobtained
inthiswaybyOilman and Johnston.'^ Important information about

tortion inanorganic crystal ofplatinum phthalocyanine, which hasavery large lattice
spacing (12A)[J.W.Menter, Proc. Roy. Soc.(London), vol.236A, p.119, 1956]. An
indication ofthelattice distortion atadislocation inmetals hasbeen obtained by
making useofthemagnification resulting from moire patterns produced byelectron
transmission through twothinoverlapping crystals with slightly different orienta-
tions orlattice spacings. SeeG.A.Bassett, J.W.Menter, andD.W.Pashley, Proc.
Roy. Soc.(London), vol.246A, p.345, 1958.

consequently preferential etching occurs atthedislocation. Figure 5-4
shows anetch-pit structure inaniron-silicon alloywhich wasmade visible

useful because theycanbeusedwithbulk samples. However, caremust

alldislocations intersecting thesurface arerevealed.
Asimilar method ofdetecting dislocations istoform avisible precipitate

often called "decoration" ofdislocations. Thistechnique was firstused

work hasbeen done along these lines with theAl-Cu precipitation-
hardening system andwith silicon crystals.
Themost powerful method available today forthedetection ofdis-
locations inmetals istransmission electron microscopy ofthin foils.*
Thin sheet, lessthan 1mmthick, isthinned afterdeformation byelectro-
polishing toathickness ofabout 1,000 A.Atthisthickness thespecimen
istransparent toelectrons intheelectron microscope. Although the
crystal lattice cannot beresolved, individual dislocation lines canbe
observed because theintensity ofthediffracted electron beam isaltered
bythestrain field ofthedislocation. Bymeans ofthistechnique ithas
been possible toobserve dislocation networks (Fig. 6-3), stacking faults,
dislocation pile-up atgrain boundaries (Fig. 5-1),Cottrell-Lomer barriers,
andmany other structural features ofdislocation theory. Dislocation

resolved intoedgeandscrew components. Forexample, inFig. 6-4,the
dislocation loop ispurescrew atpointAandpureedge atpoint B,while
along most ofitslength ithasmixed edgeandscrew components. Note,
however, thattheBurgers vector isthesame along theentire dislocation

the crystal and thiswould mean
thatanother dislocation linewould
runacross theslipped region.
Aconvenient way ofdefining the
Burgers vector ofadislocation isby
means oftheBurgers circuit. Con-
sider Fig. 4-8,which shows the
atomic arrangement around anedge
dislocation. Starting atalattice
point, imagine apath traced from
atom toatom, anequal distance in
each direction, always inthedirec-
tion ofoneofthevectors oftheunit
cell. Iftheregion enclosed bythepath does notcontain adislocation,
theBurgers circuit will close. However, ifthepath encloses adisloca-
tion,theBurgers circuit willnotclose. Theclosure failure oftheBurgers
circuit istheBurgers vector b.The closure failure ofaBurgers circuit

vectors.
Because adislocation represents theboundary between theslipped and
unslipped region ofacrystal, topographic considerations demand that it
either must beaclosed loop orelsemust endatthefreesurface ofthe
crystal. Ingeneral, adislocation linecannot end inside ofacrystal.
Theexception isatanode,where three orfour dislocation linesmeet. A

combining toproduce aresultant dislocation bs.Thevector bsisgiven
bythevector sum ofbiand b2.
Since theperiodic force field ofthecrystal lattice requires thatatoms
mustmove from oneequilibrium position toanother, itfollows thatthe
Burgers vector must always connect oneequilibrium lattice position with
another. Therefore, thecrystal structure willdetermine thepossible
Burgers vectors. Adislocation withaBurgers vector equal toonelattice
.spacing issaid tobeadislocation ofunit strength. Because ofenergy

164 Metallurgical Fundamentals [Chap. 6
considerations dislocations with strengths larger than unity aregenerally
unstable anddissociate intotwoormore dislocations oflower strength.
The criterion fordeciding whether ornotdissociation willoccur isbased^
onthefactthatthestrain energy ofadislocation isproportional tothe
square ofitsBurgers vector. Therefore, the dissociation reaction
bi—^b2+bswilloccurwhen br^>hi^+63^,butnot if61"<62^+63^.
Dislocations with strengths lessthanunity arepossible inclose-packed
lattices where theequilibrium positions arenottheedges ofthestructure

axes ofthecrystallographic structure cell. Thus, theBurgers vector for

generally written, b=(ao/2) [110]. The strength ofadislocation
with Burgers vector aaluvw] is\h\—ao[w^+w^+w'^Y'-. Forexample,
themagnitude oftheBurgers vector given above is\h\=ao/\/2.
Adislocation ofunitstrength, orunit dislocation, hasaminimum energy
when itsBurgers vector isparallel toadirection ofclosest atomic packing
inthe lattice. This agrees with theexperimental observation that
crystals almost always slipintheclose-packed directions. Aunit dis-
location ofthistype isalsosaidtobeaperfect dislocation because transla-
tionequal tooneBurgers vector produces anidentity translation. Fora
perfect dislocation there isperfect alignment ofatom planes above and
below theslipplane within thedislocation loop.Aunit dislocation par-
allel totheslipdirection cannot dissociate further unless itbecomes an
imperfect dislocation, where atranslation ofoneBurgers vector doesnot
result inanidentity translation. Astacking fault isproduced bythe
dissociation ofaunit dislocation intotwoimperfect dislocations. Fora

must begreater than theincrease ininterfacial energy ofthefaulted
region.

The shortest lattice vector is(ao/2) [110], which connects anatom ata

However, consideration oftheatomic arrangement onthe{111} slip

Acharacteristic ofthefeelattice isthatanyBurgers vector iscommon

These ideas areborne outbyelectron-microscope transmission studies
ofdislocation networks inthin foils.^Stacking faults canbereadily
detected inthese thin films. Thenature ofthedislocation network infee
metals changes withthestacking-fault energy. Austenitic stainless steel,

Frank' pointed outthatanother type ofpartial dislocation canexist in
thefeelattice. Figure 6-7illustrates asetof(111) planes viewed from
theedge. Thecenter part ofthemiddle Aplane ismissing. Anedge
dislocation isformed inthisregion with aBurgers vector (ao/3)[lll].
This iscalled aFrank partial dislocation. ItsBurgers vector isper-
pendicular tothecentral stacking fault. Since glidemust berestricted
totheplane ofthestacking faultandtheBurgers vector isnormal to
thisplane, theFrank partial dislocation cannot movebyglide. Forthis
reason itiscalled asessile dislocation. Asessile dislocation canmove only
bythediffusion ofatoms orvacancies toorfrom thefault, i.e.,bythe
process ofclimb. Because climb isnotalikely process atordinary
temperatures, sessile dislocations provide obstacles tothemovement of
other dislocations. Dislocations which glide freely over the slipplane,
such asperfect dislocations orShockley partials, arecalled glissile. A
method bywhich amissing row ofatoms canbecreated inthe(111)
plane isbythecondensation ofadisk ofvacancies onthat plane. Evi-
dence forthecollapse ofdisks ofvacancies inaluminum hasbeenobtained
bytransmission electron microscopy.-
Sessile dislocations areproduced inthefeelattice bytheglide ofdis-
locations onintersecting (111) planes. These sessile dislocations are

Since allthree dislocations must beparallel

Theplane (001) contains both theBurgers

thedislocation formed from Lomer's reac-
tionshould notglide freely. However, itisnotatrue sessile disloca-

Cottrell-Lomer reaction forms anisosceles triangle which islocked
rigidly inplace andcannot glide. Therefore, Cottrell-Lomer locking
provides aneffective barrier toslip. Studies bytransmission electron
microscopy ofdislocation interaction inthin foilshave confirmed the
existence ofinteraction that isinagreement with themodel ofCottrell-
Lomer locking.1
Cottrell-Lomer barriers canbeovercome athigh stresses and/or
temperatures. Amathematical analysis ofthestress required tobreak

However, ithasbeen shown'' that fortheimportant case ofscrew disloca-
tions piled upatCottrell-Lomer barriers thescrew dislocations can
generally escape thepile-up bycross slipbefore thestress ishighenough

Asdiscussed above, both thepartial dislocations formed bythisreaction
arepure screw, andbecause ofthegeometry ofthesituation, they arenot
completely confined tothe(112) slipplane. Ananalysis^ oftheatomic
positions giving risetostacking faults on{112} planes shows that there
aretwotypes whichmay result. While theexistence ofstacking faults
inthebcclattice hasbeendemonstrated byX-ray diffraction, detailed
studies ofthedislocation reactions discussed inthisparagraph have not
yetbeenmade.
CottrelP hassuggested another dislocation reaction, which appears to
lead totheformation ofimmobile dislocations inthebcc lattice. This
dislocation reaction maybeimportant tothebrittle fracture ofbccmetals.

6-7. Stress Field ofaDislocation
Adislocation issurrounded byanelastic stress field thatproduces
forces onother dislocations andresults ininteraction between dislocations
andsolute atoms. Forthecase ofaperfect dislocation agood approxi-
mation ofthestress fieldcanbeobtained from themathematical theory
ofelasticity forcontinuous media. However, theequations obtained
arenotvalid close tothecore ofthedislocation line. Theequations
given below apply tostraight edgeandscrew dislocations inanisotropic
crystal.1The stress around astraight dislocation willbeagood approxi-
mation tothataround acurved dislocation atdistances that aresmall
compared with theradius ofcurvature. Appreciably greater complexity
results from theconsideration ofacrystal with anisotropic elastic
constants.^

When anexternal force ofsufficient magnitude isapplied toacrystal,
thedislocations move andproduce slip. Thus, there isaforce acting on

This force isnormal tothedislocation lineatevery point along itslength
and isdirected toward theunslipped part oftheglide plane.
Because thestrain energy ofadislocation line isproportional toits
length, workmust beperformed toincrease itslength. Therefore, itis
convenient toconsider that adislocation possesses alinetension which
attempts tominimize itsenergy byshortening itslength. The lineten-

mation ofthelinetension. Anapproximation often used isF~0.5Gb^.
This isobtained from Eq. (6-13) when typical values ri=1,000Aand
ro=2Aareused.
6-9. Forces between Dislocations
Dislocations ofopposite signonthesame slipplane willattract each
other, runtogether, andannihilate each other. Thiscanbeseen readily
forthecase ofanedge dislocation (Fig. 4-8),where thesuperposition of
apositive andnegative dislocation onthesame slipplane would elimi-
nate theextra plane ofatoms andtherefore thedislocation would dis-
appear. Conversely, dislocations oflikesignonthesame slipplane will
repel each other.
The simplest situation toconsider istheforce between two parallel
screw dislocations. Since thestress field ofascrew dislocation isradially
symmetrical, theforce between them isacentral force which depends
onlyonthedistance thatthey areapart.
Fr=re.h=^(6-16)
The force isattractive fordislocations ofopposite sign (antiparallel
screws) andrepulsive fordislocations ofthesame sign (parallel screws).
Consider now theforces between two parallel edge dislocations with
thesame Burgers vectors. Referring toFig. 6-10, theedge dislocations
areatPand Q,parallel tothezaxis, with their Burgers vectors along
theXaxis. The force between them isnotacentral force, andsoitis

The situation oftwo parallel dislocations with different Burgers vec-
torscanberationalized byconsidering their relative energies.' This

fusion occurs bythemovement ofvacancies, thisimplies that dislocation

There isnorequirement thatadislocation must beconfined toasingle
plane. When adislocation moves from one slipplane toanother, itcre-
atesastep, orjog,inthedislocation line. Jogscanbeproduced bythe
intersection ofdislocations, aswasshown earlier, inFig. 4-29, orajog
canbeproduced during climb owing tothefailure ofclimb tooccur along
theentire length oftheextra halfplane ofatoms.
The intersection oftwoedge dislocations isillustrated inFig. 6-14.

ments. Itisfound thatabout halftheincreased resistivity duetocold
work anneals outover well-defined temperature ranges andwith acti-
vation energies which generally agree with thetemperatures and acti-
vation energies observed fortheannealing ofquenched andirradiated
samples. Moreover, thechanges inresistivity areaccomplished with
littlechange inmechanical strength, indicating that dislocations arenot
responsible fortheresistivity changes. Thegeneration ofpoint defects
duetodeformation hasbeendemonstrated inionic crystals bymeasure-
ments ofconductivity anddensity andbytheobservation ofcolor centers.
Jogs indislocation linescanactassources andsinks forpoint defects.
Because ofthereentrant corner atajog, itisafavorable center forthe
absorption andannihilation ofvacancies. Itisalsogenerally considered
thatvacancies canbegenerated atjogs. Theusual mechanism^ involves
thejogsformed bytheintersection ofscrew dislocations. Aswaspointed
outintheprevious section, motion ofascrew dislocation containing jogs
inadirection normal toitsaxiscanoccur onlybyclimb. Asthejog
climbs, itgenerates vacancies. However, twopoints ofdoubt havebeen
raised about thismechanism. Friedel^ haspointed outthat there isno
reason whyajogshould notglide along ascrew dislocation without pro-
ducing vacancies solong asitcanshortly attach itself toanedgecom-
ponent ofthedislocation line. Cottrell^ hasshown thatthejogsformed
byintersecting screw dislocations willgenerally produce interstitials, not
vacancies. However, annealing experiments show thatvacancies rather
than interstitials arethepredominant point defect incold-worked metals.
Other mechanisms forthegeneration ofvacancies byjogsondislocations
have been proposed byFriedel, Mott, and Cottrell.^ While theexact
details forthemechanism ofvacancy formation during coldwork have
notbeen established, there islittle question that jogformation dueto
theintersection ofdislocations isinvolved.
Anattractive force exists between vacancies anddislocations. There-

down andallowing theatmosphere tointeract once again with the
dislocations.
6-14. Dislocation Sources
Thelowyield strength ofpure crystals leads totheconclusion that
dislocation sources must exist incompletely annealed crystals and in
crystals carefully solidified from themelt. The lineenergy ofadisloca-
tion issohigh astomake itvery unlikely that stresses ofreasonable
magnitude cancreate new dislocations inaregion ofacrystal where no
dislocations exist, evenwith theassistance ofthermal fluctuations. This
results inanimportant difference between linedefects andpoint defects.
Thedensity ofdislocations inthermal equilibrium withacrystal isvanish-
ingly small. There isnogeneral relationship between dislocation density
andtemperature such asexists with vacancies. Since dislocations are
notaffected bythermal fluctuations attemperatures below which recrys-
tallization occurs, ametal canhave widely different dislocation densities
depending upon processing conditions. Completely annealed material
willcontain about 10^to10*dislocation lines persquare centimeter,
while heavily cold-worked metal willhave adislocation density ofabout
10'^dislocation lines persquare centimeter.
Itisgenerally believed that allmetals, with theexception oftiny
whiskers, initially contain anappreciable number ofdislocations, pro-
duced astheresult ofthegrowth ofthecrystal from themelt orthe
vapor phase. Experimental evidence fordislocations incrystals solidi-
fiedunder carefully controlled conditions hasbeen obtained byetch-pit
studies andbyX-ray diffraction methods. Forcrystals grown byvapor

deposition ithasbeenshown that nucleation ofthesoUd phase occurs
around screw dislocations emerging from thesurface ofthesolid substrate.
Ample evidence oftheexistence ofthree-dimensional dislocation net-
works inannealed ionic crystals hasbeen provided bydislocation deco-
ration techniques. Inannealed metals, dislocation loops have been
observed bytransmission-electron microscopy ofthin films.^These
loops arebelieved tooriginate from thecollapse ofdisks ofvacancies
andcorrespond toprismatic dislocations. There issome evidence to
indicate that these loops cangrowandjoinuptoform dislocation net-
works inannealed, unworked crystals. There isalsosome evidence to
suggest thatsome ofthecondensed vacancies form voids, which arethen
responsible fortheformation ofdislocations. While there islittledoubt
thatdislocations exist inannealed orcarefully solidified metal, much more
information isneeded about themechanism, bywhich they areproduced
andtheway inwhich they arearranged inthemetal.
6-15.Multiplication ofDislocations—Frank-Read Source
One oftheoriginal stumbling blocks inthedevelopment ofdislocation
theory wastheformulation ofareasonable mechanism bywhich sources
originally present inthemetal could produce new dislocations bythe
process ofslip. Such amechanism isrequired when itisrealized that
thesurface displacement ataslipband isduetothemovement ofabout
1,000 dislocations over theslipplane. Thus, thenumber ofdislocation
sources initially present inametal could notaccount fortheobserved
slip-band spacing anddisplacement unless there weresomeway inwhich
each source could produce largeamounts ofslipbefore itbecame immobi-
lized. Moreover, ifthere werenosource generating dislocations, cold
work should decrease, rather than increase, thedensity ofdislocations in
asingle crystal. Thus, theremust beamethod ofgenerating dislocations
orofmultiplying thenumber initially present toproduce thehigh dis-
location density found incold-worked metal. Thescheme bywhich dis-
locations could begenerated from existing dislocations wasproposed by
Frank andRead^ and iscommonly called aFrank-Read source.
Consider adislocation lineDD'lying inaslipplane (Fig. 6-15a).The
plane ofthefigure istheslipplane. Thedislocation lineleaves theslip

FRACTURE
7-1 .Introduction
Fracture istheseparation, orfragmentation, ofasolidbody intotwo
ormore parts under theaction ofstress. Theprocess offracture canbe
considered tobemade upoftwocomponents, crack initiation andcrack
propagation. Fractures canbeclassified intotwogeneral categories,
ductile fracture and brittle fracture. Aductile fracture ischaracterized
byappreciable plastic deformation prior toandduring thepropagation
ofthecrack. Anappreciable amount ofgross deformation isusually
present atthefracture surfaces. Brittle fracture inmetals ischaracter-
izedbyarapid rate ofcrack propagation, withnogross deformation and
very little microdeformation. Itisakin tocleavage inionic crystals.
Thetendency forbrittle fracture isincreased with decreasing temper-
ature, increasing strain rate,and triaxial stress conditions (usually pro-
duced byanotch). Brittle fracture istobeavoided atallcost,because
itoccurs without warning andusually produces disastrous consequences.
This chapter willpresent abroad picture ofthefundamentals ofthe
fracture ofmetals. Since most oftheresearch hasbeen concentrated
ontheproblem ofbrittle fracture, thistopic willbegiven considerable
prominence. The engineering aspects ofbrittle fracture willbecon-
sidered ingreater detail inChap. 14.Fracture occurs incharacteristic
ways, depending onthestate ofstress, therate ofapplication ofstress,
andthetemperature. Unless otherwise stated, itwillbeassumed inthis
chapter that fracture isproduced byasingle application ofauniaxial
tensile stress. Fracture luider more complex conditions willbecon-
sidered inlater chapters. Typical examples arefracture duetotorsion
(Chap. 10),fatigue (Chap. 12),andcreep (Chap. 13)andlow-temper-
ature brittle fracture, temper embrittlement, orhydrogen embrittlement
(Chap. 14).
7-2.Types ofFracture inMetals
Metals canexhibit many different types offracture, depending onthe
material, temperature, state ofstress, and rate ofloading. Thetwo
190

broad categories ofductile and brittle fracture have already been con-
sidered. Figure 7-1schematically illustrates some ofthetypes oftensile
fractures which canoccur inmetals. Abrittle fracture (Fig. 7-la) is
characterized byseparation normal tothe tensile stress. Outwardly
there isnoevidence ofdeformation, although withX-ray diffraction
analysis itispossible todetect a
thin layer ofdeformed metal atthe
fracture surface. Brittle fractures
have been observed inbccandhep
metals, butnotinfeemetals unless
there are factors contributing to
grain-boundary embrittlement.
Ductile fractures cantake several
forms. Single crystals ofhepmetals

shear (Fig. 7-16). Polycrystalline
specimens ofvery ductile metals, like
gold orlead,may actually bedrawn
down toapoint before theyrupture
(Fig. 7-lc). Inthetensile fracture
ofmoderately ductile metals the
plastic deformation eventually produces anecked region (Fig. 7-Id).
Fracture begins atthecenter ofthespecimen andthen extends bya
shear separation along thedashed lines inFig.7-Id. This results inthe
familiar "cup-and-cone" fracture.
Fractures areclassified with respect toseveral characteristics, such as
strain tofracture, crystallographic mode offracture, andtheappearance
ofthefracture. Gensamer^ hassummarized theterms commonly used
todescribe fractures asfollows:

cleavage fracture appears bright orgranular, owing toreflection oflight
from the flatcleavage surfaces. Fracture surfaces frequently consist of
amixture offibrous andgranular fracture, and itiscustomary toreport
thepercentage ofthesurface arearepresented byoneofthese categories.
Based onmetallographic examination, fractures inpolycrystalline sam-
plesareclassified aseither transgranular (thecrack propagates through
thegrains) orintergranular (thecrack propagates along thegrainbound-
aries). Aductile fracture isonewhich exhibits aconsiderable degree of
deformation. Theboundary between aductile and brittle fracture is
arbitrary anddepends onthesituation being considered. Forexample,
nodular castiron isductile when compared with ordinary gray iron; yet
itwould beconsidered brittle when compared with mild steel. Asa
further example, adeeply notched tensile specimen willexhibit little
gross deformation; yetthefracture could occurbyashear mode.
7-3. Theoretical Cohesive Strength oFMetals
Metals areofgreat technological value, primarily because oftheir high
strength combined with acertain measure ofplasticity. Inthemost
basic terms thestrength isdueto
thecohesive forces between atoms.
Ingeneral, high cohesive forces are
related tolarge elastic constants,
highmelting points, andsmall coeffi-
cients ofthermal expansion. Figure
7-2shows thevariation ofthecohe-
sive force between twoatoms asa
function oftheseparation between
these atoms. This curve isthere-
sultant oftheattractive andrepul-
siveforces between theatoms. The
interatomic spacing oftheatoms in
theunstrained condition isindicated
byao. Ifthecrystal issubjected toatensile load, theseparation between
atoms willbeincreased. Therepulsive force decreases more rapidly with
increased separation than theattractive force, sothatanetforcebetween
atoms balances thetensile load. Asthetensile load isincreased still
further, therepulsive force continues todecrease. Apoint isreached
where therepulsive force isnegligible andtheattractive force isdecreas-
ingbecause oftheincreased separation oftheatoms. This corresponds
tothemaximum inthecurve, which isequal tothetheoretical cohesive

than theobserved fracture strengths ofmetals. Only thefracture

cohesive strength.
7-4. Griffith Theory ofBrittle Fracture
The firstexplanation ofthediscrepancy between theobserved fracture
strength ofcrystals andthetheoretical cohesive strength wasproposed
byGriffith.^ Griffith's theory initsoriginal form isapplicable only to
aperfectly brittle material such asglass. However, while itcannot be
applied directly tometals, Griffith's ideas havehadgreat influence on
thethinking about thefracture ofmetals.
Griffith proposed thatabrittle material contains apopulation offine
cracks which produce astress concentration ofsufficient magnitude so
thatthetheoretical cohesive strength isreached
inlocalized regions atanominal stress which is
wellbelow thetheoretical value. When oneof
thecracks spreads intoabrittle fracture, itpro-

Within theaccuracy oftheestimate, thisequation predicts thesame

Griffith's theory satisfactorily predicts thefracture strength ofacom-
pletely brittle material such asglass.^Inglass, reasonable values of
crack length ofabout 1narecalculated from Eq. (7-11). Forzinc, the
theory predicts acrack length ofseveral millimeters. This average
crack length could easily begreater than thethickness ofthespecimen,
andtherefore thetheory cannot apply.
Early experiments onthefracture ofglass fibers showed thatstrengths
close tothetheoretical fracture strength could beobtained with fibers
freshly drawn from themelt. Thehighest fracture strengths werefound
withthesmallest-diameter fibers, sinceontheaverage these fibers would
have theshortest microcracks. However, other factors besides diam-
eter, such asmethod ofpreparation, temperature ofthemelt, and
amount andrate ofdrawing from themelt, canaffect strength. Recent
results^ indicate that there isnodependence ofstrength ondiameter
when different-size glass fibers areprepared under nearly identical con-
ditions. Experiments onmetal whiskers* have alsodemonstrated frac-
ture strengths close tothetheoretical value. Thestrength ofametal
whisker varies inversely with itsdiameter. This isthetype ofsize

pheric attack, decrease toalowvalue within afewhours ofbeing drawn

Joffe^ showed that thefracture strength ofNaCl crystals could be
greatly increased when the testwas carried outunder water. This
Joffe effect hasbeen attributed tothehealing ofsurface cracks bythe
solution ofthesaltcrystal inthewater. Thefracture behavior ofother
ionic crystals hasbeenshown todepend ontheenvironment incontact
with thesurface. However, theJoffe effect inthese crystals cannot
always beexplained simply bysurface dissolution.

Metals which fracture inabrittle manner show evidence ofathinlayer
ofplastically deformed metal when thefracture surface isexamined by
X-ray diffraction.- Other indications that brittle fracture inmetals is
always preceded byasmallamount ofplastic deformation, onamicro-
scopic scale, aregiven inSec. 7-7. Therefore, itappears that Griffith's
theory, initsoriginal form, should notbeexpected toapply tothebrittle
fracture ofmetals.
Orowan' suggested that theGriffith equation could bemade more
compatible with brittle fracture inmetals bytheinclusion ofaterm p

ture willthen occur by"shearing off" (Fig. 7-16). More usually, slip
willoccur onsystems other than thebasal plane, sothat thecrystal

change inorientation ofonlyabout 2°.
7-7.Metallosraphic Aspects ofBrittle Fracture
Because oftheprominence oftheGriffith theory, ithasbeen natural
formetallurgists tousetheir microscopes inasearch forGriffith cracks in
metals. However, based onobservations uptothemagnifications avail-
ablewith theelectron microscope, there isnoreliable evidence that
Griffith cracks exist inmetals intheunstressed condition. There is,
however, agrowing amount ofexperimental evidence toshow that
microcracks canbeproduced byplastic deformation.
Metallographic evidence oftheformation ofmicrocracks atnonmetallic
inclusions insteel asaresult ofplastic deformation hasexisted foranum-
berofyears. These microcracks donotnecessarily produce brittle frac-
ture. However, theydocontribute totheobserved anisotropy inthe
ductile-fracture strength. The factthatvacuum-melted steel, which is
verylowininclusions, shows areduction inthefracture anisotropy sup-
ports theidea ofmicrocracks being formed atsecond-phase particles.
Anexcellent correlation between plastic deformation, microcracks, and
brittle fracture wasmade byLow.^ Heshowed that formild steel ofa

tility transition temperature Td.Theexistence ofatransition temper-
ature isindicated bythedrop inthereduction ofarea atthefracture

thefracture stress. Thepercentage ofgrains containing microcracks
increases rapidly inregion Cjustbelow Td.However, microcracks are

because theyield stress isincreasing with decreasing temperature. In
regionEcleavage fracture occurs abruptly before there istime fordis-
continuous yielding. Presumably fracture occurs atthe first spot to
undergo discontinuous yielding. Finally, atverylowtemperatures in

present shows that theconditions fortheinitiation ofacrack arenot
necessarily thesame asconditions forthepropagation ofacrack. The
process ofcleavage fracture should beconsidered tobemade upof
three steps, (1)plastic deformation, (2)crack initiation, and (3)crack
propagation.
Most brittle fractures occur inatransgranular manner. However, if
thegrain boundaries contain afilm ofbrittle constituent, asinsensitized7^^

austenitic stainless steel ormolybdenum alloys containing oxygen, nitro-
gen,orcarbon, thefracture willoccur inanintergranular manner. Inter-
granular failure canalsooccur without thepresence ofamicroscopically
visible precipitate atthegrain boundaries. Apparently, segregation at
thegrain boundaries canlower thesurface energy sufficiently tocause
intergranular failure. Theembrittlement produced bytheaddition of
antimony tocopper andoxygen toironandthetemper embrittlement
ofalloy steels aregood examples.
Sometimes aconsiderable amount ofinformation canbeobtained by
examining thesurfaces ofthefracture atfairly highmagnifications. This
type ofexamination isknown asfractography.^ Athigh magnification,
transgranular-cleavage surfaces usually contain alargenumber ofcleav-
agestepsanda"river pattern" ofbranching cracks (Fig. 7-6). These
areindications oftheabsorption ofenergy bylocal deformation. The

general absence ofcleavage steps. From theappearance ofthefracture
surface, theenergy absorbed inanintergranular fracture ismuch lower
than fortransgranular cleavage.
7-8. Dislocation Theories ofFracture
Theideathatthehigh stresses produced atthehead ofadislocation
pile-up could produce fracture was firstadvanced byZener.^ Theshear
stress acting onthe slipplane squeezes thedislocations together. At
some critical value ofstress thedislocations atthehead ofthepile-up
arepushed soclose together thatthey coalesce intoanembryonic crack
orcavity dislocation. After analyzing thestresses atadislocation pile-up
andmaking useoftheGriffith criterion, Stroh^ hasproposed thatacleav-
agecrack canformwhen ndislocations piledupunder theaction ofa

This equation isvery similar totheequation expressing thegrain-size

This similarity istobeexpected inview ofthefactthat yielding and
brittle fracture areclosely related. Inboth equations aiisthefrictional
stress resisting themotion ofanunlocked dislocation. This term
increases with decreasing temperature oftesting. Theconstant Kin
thefracture equation isgiven approximately byEq. (7-22). Thecon-
stantKyintheyield-strength equation isameasure ofthelocalized stress
needed tounlock dislocations heldupatagrain boundary sothat yield-
ingcanbetransmitted tothenext grainbythepropagation ofaLiiders
band. Thisquantity isimportant incurrent theories offracture.
The factthat brittle fracture canoccur insingle crystals suggests that
therole ofgrain boundaries asbarriers fordislocation pile-up maybe
overemphasized incurrent theories. Also, itisquestionable that the
necessary stress concentration canbeproduced atthehead ofapile-up
before slipoccurs intheneighboring grains torelieve thehigh localized
stresses. Itispossible thatdeformation twinsmay actasbarriers for
dislocation pile-up. Forexample, thestrong orientation dependence of
thebrittle fracture ofiron single crystals canbeexplained' onthis basis.
While there isexperimental evidence toindicate thattwin intersections
may initiate brittle fracture,- there isalsoevidence toshow that brittle
fracture canbeproduced intheabsence ofmechanical twins. Another
mechanism bywhich cracks canform istheglide ofdislocations oninter-
secting slipplanes according tothehypothesis ofCottrelP (seeSec.6-6
and Fig. 6-9). Thismechanism isenergetically favorable forabccand
hepmetal, butnotforanfeelattice, inagreement with thefactthat
feemetals donotundergo brittle fracture.
Aconsideration oftheknown facts offracture hasledCottrell and
Fetch independently toconclude thatthegrowth ofamicrocrack intoa
self-propagating fracture isamore difficult stepthan thenucleation of
microcracks from glide dislocations. Support forthisviewpoint isfound
inthefactthatmany nonpropagating microcracks areobserved. More-
over, crack nucleation bydislocation coalescence should depend onlyon
theshear stress, notthehydrostatic component ofstress. Butthere is
ample experimental evidence that fracture isstrongly influenced bythe
hydrostatic component ofstress (seeSec. 7-16). Ifthepropagation of
microcracks, according toaGriffith-type criterion, isthecontrolling step
infracture, thestress normal tothecrack would beanimportant factor.

High values ofsurface energy tend topromote ductile fracture.
Unfortunately, this isnotafactor which isreadily increased, although
various environmental andmetallurgical conditions maylower thesur-
face energy. Theembrittlement ofsteel due tohydrogen hasbeen
attributed tothis factor. Intergranular fracture duetoanembrittling
filmmay alsobeexplained inthisway.
Itiswellknown that thepresence ofanotch greatly increases the
tendency forbrittle fracture. Thecomplicated effects ofanotch willbe

The factthat brittle fracture occurs when plastic deformation fails to
keep thestress below acritical value indicates that there should bea
connection between delayed yielding and brittle fracture. Thedelay
time isquite temperature-dependent, andsoisbrittle fracture. Inthe
temperature region where brittle fracture iscaused byanavalanche of
dislocations breaking away from abarrier andrunning together toform
acrack, delayed yielding probably plays theimportant role oflocalizing
the slipbypreventing nearby dislocation sources from operating. At
temperatures where themetal fractures inaductile manner thedelay
time issoshort that slipoccurs around thepile-ups andthehigh localized
stresses aredissipated byplastic deformation. Thisagreement issup-
ported bythefactthatmetals which have aductile-to-brittle fracture
transition alsohave adelayed yieldphenomenon.

bydislocation pile-ups atgrain boundaries. However, itisextremely
unlikely that dislocation pile-ups large enough toproduce cavity dis-
locations canbeproduced inductile feemetals likealuminum andcopper.
Instead, voids inthese metals appear tobenucleated atforeign particles
such asoxide particles, impurity phases, orsecond-phase particles.
Under tensile strain either themetal separates from theinclusion, or
theinclusion itself fractures. ^Even inmetals forwhich nocrack-
nucleating second-phase particles canbeobserved, itappears that
fracture-nucleating elements arepresent before deformation. This is
borne outbythefactthatthefracture stress andreduction inareacan
beappreciably lower when tested inadirection perpendicular tothe
original rolling orextrusion direction thanwhen tested inthedirection
ofworking, eventhough allmicrostructural evidence ofworking hasbeen
removed byheat treatment and there isnostrong crystallographic
texture. Itmust beassumed thatworking elongates these "sites" so
thattheyopen intovoids more readily when thetensile stress isapplied

7-12.Notch Effect inFracture
Thechanges produced bytheintroduction ofanotch have important
implications forthefracture ofmetals. Thepresence ofanotch will
veryappreciably increase thetemperature atwhich asteelchanges from
ductile tobrittle fracture. Theintroduction ofanotch results inastress
concentration attheroot ofthenotch. Figure 7-10shows thenon-
uniform distribution ofthelongitudinal tensile stress inanotched tensile
bar.When yielding occurs attheroot ofthenotch, thestress concen-
tration isreduced. However, transverse and radial stresses aresetup
inthevicinity ofthenotch (Fig. 7-10). The radial stress <triszero at
thefreesurface attheroot ofthenotch, but itrises toahighvalue in
theinterior ofthespecimen andthen drops offagain. Thetransverse
stress (ttacts inthecircumferential direction ofacylindrical specimen.
This stress drops from ahigh value atthenotch root toalower value
atthespecimen axis.
Theoccurrence ofthis state ofstress canbeexplained bythecon-
straints toplastic flowwhich anotch setsup.Foranequilibrium of

forces tobemaintained inthenotched bar, itisnecessary thatnostresses
actnormal tothefreesurfaces ofthenotch. Allthetensile loadmust be
taken bythemetal inthecore ofthenotch. Therefore, arelatively large
mass ofunstressed metal exists around acentral core ofhighly stressed
material. The central core tries tocontract laterally because ofthePois-
soneffect, but itisrestrained bywhatamounts
toahoop ofunstressed material around it.
The resistance oftheunstressed mass ofma-
terial tothedeformation ofthecentral core
produces radial andtransverse stresses.
The existence ofradial and transverse
stresses (triaxial stress state) raises thevalue
oflongitudinal stress atwhich yielding occurs.
For simplification, consider that yielding oc-
curs atacritical shear stress Tc.Foranun-
notched tension specimen this critical value is
givenby
Tc-2
Foranotched tension specimen thisbecomes

thesame forboth cases, itisapparent from
these equations that theexistence oftrans-
verse stresses requires ahigher longitudinal
stress toproduce yielding. The entire flow
curve ofanotched specimen israised over
that foranunnotched specimen because ofthis effect. Theamount by
which theflowcurve israised because ofthenotch canbeexpressed bya
plastic-constraint factor q.
Plastic constraint differs from elastic-stress concentration inabasic
way. From elastic considerations thestress concentration attheroot of
anotch canbemade extremely high astheradius attheroot of
thenotch approaches zero.When plastic deformation occurs attheroot
ofthenotch, theelastic-stress concentration isreduced toalowvalue.
However, plastic deformation produces plastic constraint attheroot of
thenotch. Incontrast toelastic-stress concentrations, nomatter how
sharp thenotch theplastic-constraint factor^ cannot exceed avalue of
about 3.

Athird important contribution ofanotch istoproduce anincrease in
thelocal strain rate. While thenotch isstillloaded intheelastic region,
thestress atapoint nearthenotch israpidly increasing withtimebecause
ofthesharp gradients. Since stress isproportional tostrain, there isa
high local elastic strain rate.When yielding occurs, theplastic flow
tends torelieve thestresses. The stress picture changes from one of
high elastic stresses toalower plastic constraint, and insodoing ahigh
plastic strain ratedevelops near thenotch.

arefortheordinary tensile fracture ofaductile metal inwhich ashear
type offracture takes place. Theseparation between thetwofracture
curves andtheir relative height willbedifferent forother conditions of
fracture.
Inprinciple, apoint onthefracture curve isobtained byplastically
straining aspecimen toagiven point ontheflowcurve andthen intro-
ducing embrittling parameters (lowtemperature oranotch) sothatthe
specimen isstressed tofailure without added strain. Byrepeating this
process with different specimens stressed todifferent values ofplastic
strain itwould bepossible toconstruct theentire fracture curve. How-
ever, since theembrittling effect ofanotch islimited toaplastic-con-
straint factor ofabout 3,itisgenerally more effective toattempt to
resist anyfurther deformation bycarrying outthetestataverylow
temperature. Actually, withmost metals this isnotpossible since a
slightamount ofdeformation invariably results onstraining atlowtem-
perature. Inview oftheevidence that fracture isinitiated byplastic
deformation, itwould appear that thefracture stress measured bythis
technique doesnotmeasure thetrue resistance ofthemetal tofracture.
Further, thefracture stress forductile fracture isvery difficult tomeas-
ureaccurately because theductile fracture isinitiated attheinterior of
thespecimen, andthestress distribution iscomplicated bynecking ofthe
tensile specimen. Therefore, there isnoreliable method fordetermining
thefracture curve ofmetals. However, thisdoesnotprohibit using the
concept ofthefracture stress, inaqualitative sense, where itisuseful
fordescribing certain aspects offracture.
7-14. Classical Theory oftheDuctile-to-Brittle Transition
Brittle fracture ispromoted bythreemain factors, (1)atriaxial state
ofstress, (2)alowtemperature, and (3)ahigh strain rate. Intheprevi-
oussection itwasshown thatthepresence ofanotch provides condition 1
andcontributes tocondition 3.Temperature hasastrong effect onthe
basic flowandfracture properties ofthemetal. For allmetals theyield
stress orflow stress increases with decreasing temperature. With fee
metals, where there isnoductile-to-brittle transition, theincrease inyield
stress ongoing fromroom temperature toliquid-nitrogen temperature
(—196°C) isabout afactor of2.Inbccmetals, which show aductile-
to-brittle transition, theyield stress increases byafactor of3to8over
thesame temperature range. Figure 7-5illustrates thetrends infrac-
ture stress and yield stress with temperature. Italsoshows that the
reduction ofarea atfracture inatensile specimen drops offrapidly over
anarrow temperature interval. Thetemperature range atwhich this
transition occurs iscalled thetransition temperature.

Sec.7-14] Hracture 217
tThe so-called classical theory oftheductile-to-brittle transition was
suggested byDavidenkov andWittman.^ According tothisconcept,
theexistence ofatransition temperature isduetothedifference inthe
waytheresistances toshearandcleavage change withtemperature. The
relative values ofthese twoparameters determine whether thefracture
willbeductile orbrittle. Above thetransition temperature theflow
stress isreached before thefracture
stress, while below thetransition
temperature thefracture stress is
reached first. Factors which in-
crease the critical shear stress for
slipwithout atthesame time raising
thefracture stress willfavor brittle
fracture. Decreasing thetempera-
tureand increasing thestrain rate
bothhave this effect. InFig. 7-13,
thecurve marked ctogives thetem-
perature dependence ofyield stress
forsimple tension. The ciu've qao,
where q«3,isthetemperature de-
pendence oftheyield stress inthe
presence oftheplastic constraint at

Inagreement with available data, itisdrawn asalesssensitive func-
tion oftemperature than theyield stress. Atransition temperature
occurs when acurve offlow stress intersects thecleavage strength. For
anunnotched tension specimen thisoccurs ataquite lowtemperature,
butforanotched testthetransition temperature ismuch closer toroom
temperature.
While thispicture oftheductile-to-brittle transition doesnotprovide
forthestructural details embodied inthedislocation theory, itdoes give
aneasily grasped working model ofthephenomenon. Asoriginally pro-
posed, this classical theory ascribes nomajor effect totherole ofstrain
rate; yetrecent experiments have indicated that strain ratemaybemore
important than plastic constraint inproducing brittle fracture. Using
sharp cleavage cracks asnotches, Felbeck andOrowan^ were unable to
produce cleavage fracture insteel plates unless thecrack reached ahigh
velocity. Extensive plastic deformation waspresent atthebase ofthe
crack inallcases. These experiments could beinterpreted onlybycon-

sidering thatthejaeld stress israised tothevalue ofthefracture stress,
notbyplastic constraint, butbytheeffect ofhigh strain rateonincreas-
ingtheyield stress. Itisdifficult toseparate these two effects, and
additional experiments would beveryworthwhile. However, itisinter-
esting tonote that theyield stress ofmild steel isvery sensitive to
strain rate. Also, thelarge increase intransition temperature that is
brought about byusing anotched-impact testcanbeunderstood onthis
basiswhen itisconsidered thatthestrain rate intheimpact test isabout
10^times greater than intheordinary tension test.
7-15.Fracture under Combined Stresses
Thephenomenological approach tofracture isconcerned withuncover-
ingthegeneral macroscopic lawswhich describe thefracture ofmetals
under allpossible states ofstress. Thissameapproach wasdiscussed in
Chap. 3with regard totheprediction ofyielding under complex states
ofstress. Theproblem ofdetermining general laws forthefracture
strength ofmetals isquite difficult because fracture issosensitive to
prior plastic straining andtemperature. Inprinciple wecanconceive of
athree-dimensional fracture surface interms ofthethree principal stresses
(Ti, 0-2,and 0-3.Foranycombination ofprincipal stresses themetal will
fracture when thelimiting surface isreached. Enough experimentation
hasbeendone torealize that thefracture surface cannot berigid but
must beconsidered asaflexible membrane which changes shape with
changes instress andstrain history.
Most experimentation inthis fieldhasbeenwith biaxial states ofstress
where oneoftheprincipal stresses iszero. Tubular specimens inwhich
anaxial tensile orcompressive load issuperimposed onthecircumfer-
ential stress produced byinternal pressure areordinarily used forthis
type ofwork. Foraccurate results bulging ornecking during thelater
stages ofthetestmust beavoided. Thismakes itdifficult toobtain
good data forvery ductile metals.
Figure 7-14 illustrates thefracture criteria which have beenmost fre-
quently proposed forfracture under abiaxial state ofstress. The
maximum-shear-stress criterion andtheVonMises, ordistortion-energy,
criterion have already been considered previously inthediscussion of
yielding criteria. Themaximum-normal-stress criterion proposes that
fracture iscontrolled onlybythemagnitude ofthegreatest principal
stress. Available dataonductile metals such asaluminum andmag-
nesium alloys^ andsteel^ indicate thatthemaximum-shear-stress criterion

forfracture results inthebestagreement. Agreement between experi-
mentandtheory isnotnearly sogood asforthecase ofyielding criteria.
Thefracture criterion forabrittle cast iron^ isshown inFig.7-15. Note'
that thenormal stress criterion isfollowed inthetension-tension region
andthatthefracture strength increases significantly asoneoftheprinci-
palstresses becomes compressive. Two theories--^ which consider the

static pressure thanwhen tested withsimple uniaxial loading. Materials
which arecompletely brittle under ordinary conditions, likelimestone or
rock salt,actually necked downwhen pulled intension withsuperimposed
hydrostatic pressure. Itwasalsofound that, ifatensile specimen was
loaded withsuperimposed pressure toapoint short offracture andthen
tested atatmospheric pressure, itrequired further deformation before
fracturing, even iftheelongation under pressure wasgreater than the
metal could v/ithstand when ordinarily tested atatmospheric pressure.
Further, theamount ofdeformation required toproduce fracture after
removal ofthehydrostatic pressure increases withanincrease inthe
magnitude ofthepressure. These facts indicate that, ingeneral, frac-
ture isnotdetermined completely bytheinstantaneous state ofstress or
strain. Bridgman was able tofindnosimple stress function which
described hisresults.

INTERNAL FRICTION
8-1 .Introduction
The ability ofavibrating solidwhich iscompletely isolated from its
surroundings toconvert itsmechanical energy ofvibration intoheat is
called internal friction, ordamping capacity. Theformer term ispre-
ferred byphysicists, andthelatter isgenerally used inengineering. If
metals behaved asperfectly elastic materials atstresses below thenominal
elastic limit, therewould benointernal friction. However, thefactthat
damping effects canbeobserved atstress levels farbelow themacroscopic
elastic limit indicates thatmetals have averylowtrue elastic limit, if,
indeed, one exists atall. Internal-friction, ordamping, effects corre-
spond toaphase lagbetween theapplied stress andtheresulting strain.
Thismaybeduesimply toplastic deformation atahigh stress level,
oratlow stress levels itmaybeduetothermal, magnetic, oratomic
rearrangements.
Animportant division ofthe field ofnonelastic behavior iscalled
anelasticity .This subject isconcerned with internal-friction effects which
areindependent oftheamplitude ofvibration. Anelastic behavior can
beduetothermal diffusion, atomic diffusion, stress relaxation across
grain boundaries, stress-induced ordering, andmagnetic interactions.
Certain static effects such astheelastic-aftereffect areconcerned with
anelastic behavior. Internal friction resulting from coldwork isstrongly
amplitude-dependent and, therefore, isnotananelastic phenomenon.
Much ofourpresent knowledge ofthemechanisms which contribute to
anelasticity isduetoZener^ and hiscoworkers.
Studies ofinternal friction areprimarily concerned with usingdamping
asatool forstudying internal structure andatommovements insolids.
Themethod hasprovided information ondiffusion, ordering, and solu-
bilities ofinterstitial elements andhasbeenused forestimating theden-
sityofdislocations. Thevibration amplitudes employed inthistype of

aspect ofthis field isthedetermination ofengineering dataonthedissi-
pation ofenergy invibrating members. Thiswork isusually concerned
with determining thedamping capacity ofamaterial attherelatively
large amplitudes encountered inengineering practice.
Internal friction ismeasured byanumber oftechniques.^ Thesim-
plest device isatorsional pendulum foruseinthelow-frequency region

excited byanelectromagnetic drive, apiezoelectric crystal, orultrasonic

arefrequently mentioned. Both models consider thatthematerial has
anelastic component coupled with aviscous component. Thebehavior
ofamaterial, with theproperties attributed toitbythetheory, canbe
duplicated byamechanical model composed ofsprings (elastic com-
ponent) anddashpots (viscous component). Figure 8-2illustrates the
composition ofaVoight andMaxwell solid, together with theequations
which themodels predict. For realmetals thefrequency dependence
ofinternal friction does notagree with theequations predicted bythe
models. Further, themodels donotaccount forthedependence of
dynamic modulus oninternal friction, which isobserved with realmetals.
Various modifications ofthemodels have been useful instudying the
mechanical properties ofpolymers, butthey areoflimited usefulness in
dealing with metals.

mine therelaxation spectrum byholding coconstant andvarying the
relaxation time r.Inmany materials, including metals, rvaries expo-

r=TOexp^(8-14)
Therefore, todetermine therelaxation spectrum, allthat isnecessary is
tomeasure aasafunction oftemperature forconstant angular frequency.
Internal-friction measurements arewell suited forstudying the dif-
fusion ofinterstitial atoms inbccmetals. Relaxation peaks ariseowing
todiffusion ofinterstitial atoms tominimum-energy positions inthe

8-4. Relaxation Spectrum
Anumber ofrelaxation processes with different relaxation times can
occur inmetals. Each willoccur inadifferent frequency region, sothat
anumber ofinternal-friction peaks canbefound ifawide range offre-
quency isinvestigated. Provided that thepeaks aresufficiently sepa-
rated, thebehavior ofthemetal intheregion ofthepeakcanbeexpressed
byEq. (8-10) with suitably determined constants. This variation of
internal friction withfrequency canbeconsidered asarelaxation spec-
trum which ischaracteristic ofaparticular material.
Theapplication ofstress toasubstitutional solid solution canproduce
ordering inanotherwise random distribution ofatoms. Analternating
stress cangive risetorelaxation between pairs ofsolute atoms.
Alargeandbroad internal-friction peak isproduced inpolycrystalline
specimens bytherelaxation ofshear stress across grain boundaries.
Work inthisareahasledtotheconclusion thatgrain boundaries behave
insomeways likeaviscous material. This interesting aspect ofinternal
friction isdiscussed inmore detail inthenext section.
Themovement oflow-energy twinboundaries duetostress isbelieved
toproduce relaxation effects.' Thistype ofdeformation isalsoresponsi-
bleforanelastic effects found inconjunction withdomain-boundary
movement inferromagnetic materials. Since twin interfaces arecrys-
tallographically coherent boundaries, theinternal friction cannot bedue
totheviscous slipassociated with incoherent boundaries.
Therelaxation peakduetopreferential ordering ofinterstitial atoms
inthelattice fromanapplied stress isoneofthebest-understood relax-
ation processes. Studies ofthisrelaxation process have provided data
onthesolubility anddiffusion ofinterstitial atoms. Thistype ofinternal
friction isconsidered inSec. 8-6. Relaxation produced bythermal fluctu-
ations willbeconsidered inSec. 8-7.

Animportant source ofinternal friction inmetals isstress relaxation
along grain boundaries. Ke- firstdemonstrated thestrong internal-
friction peakduetograin-boundary relaxation byexperiments onhigh-
purity aluminum wires. Atthelowtorsional strains used inthiswork the
strain wascompletely recoverable, and allinternal-friction effects were
independent ofamplitude. Kefound that abroad peak occurred inthe

crystalline specimen which wasnotfound withthesingle-crystal specimen

8-6.TheSnock Effect
Internal friction resulting from preferential ordering ofinterstitial
atoms under applied stress was firstexplained bySnoek' and isknown as
theSnoek effect. This type ofrelaxation hasbeen most extensively
studied inironcontaining smallamounts ofeither carbon ornitrogen in
solid solution. Interstitial carbon atoms inbccironoccupy theocta-
hedral holes inthelattice. Even though noexternal forces areapplied,
thecrystal willhave tetragonal symmetry because ofthedistortion pro-
duced bytheinterstitial atoms. Aslong asnostress isapplied, the
distribution ofatoms among theoctahedral sites israndom andthe
tetragonal axes oftheunit cellsarerandomly oriented with respect tothe
specimen axes. However, ifastress isapplied along theyaxis,theinter-
stitial atoms willmigrate tooctahedral positions which tend togive a
preferred alignment intheydirection. When thestress isremoved, the
atoms willmigrate toward arandom distribution. Under theoscillating
stresses imposed byaninternal-friction apparatus theinterstitial atoms
willbeincontinuous motion, either tending toward ortending away from
apreferred orientation. Astrong relaxation peak results. Asimilar but
weaker relaxation peak canbeobserved due toshort-range order in
substitutional solid solutions.
8-7. Thermoelastic Internal Friction
Thethermal andthemechanical behavior ofmaterials areinterrelated.
Theapplication ofasmall stress toametal willproduce aninstantaneous
strain, and this strain willbeaccompanied byasmall change intem-
perature. Anextension ofthespecimen willresult inadecrease intem-
perature, while acontraction produces atemperature rise. Thisbehavior
iscalled thethermoelastic effect. Iftheapplied stress isnotuniform
throughout thespecimen, atemperature gradient willbesetupandaddi-
tional nonelastic strain will result. Ifthenonuniform stress varies
periodically with time, afluctuating temperature gradient isproduced.
When thestress fluctuations occur ataveryhighfrequency, sothatthere
isnottime forappreciable heat flowtotake place during astress cycle, the
process isadiabatic. Noenergy lossordamping occurs under adiabatic
conditions. Ontheother hand, atverylowfrequencies there isadequate
time forheat flow,andanequilibrium temperature ismaintained inthe
specimen. This isanisothermal process, andnoenergy orheat islost.
Intheregion ofintermediate frequencies theconversion ofenergy into
heat isnotreversible, andinternal-friction effects areobserved.
Nonuniform stress canresult inmacroscopic thermal currents which

produce internal-friction peaks. Arectangular barwhich isvibrated
transversely behaves likeastandard linear solid (single relaxation time).
Thecompression side ofthespecimen willincrease intemperature, and
thetension side willundergo adecrease intemperature. Therefore, an
alternating temperature gradient isproduced across thethickness ofthe
bar.Arelaxation process occurs, provided that thefrequency issuch
that there isenough time forthermal currents toflowbackandforth
and effect apartial neutralization ofthetemperature gradient. Zener^

Thefrequency atwhich thisrelaxation peak occurs canbedetermined
from therelationship w^=1.Forspecimens ofordinary thickness, the
peakwould occur intheregion of1to100cps. Itistheoretically possi-
bleforaspecimen vibrated inalongitudinal mode toshow relaxation
from macroscopic thermal currents. However, thefrequency region
where thepeakwould occur would beoftheorder 10^"to10^^cps,which
iswellbeyond therange ofnormal observations. Norelaxation from
macroscopic thermal currents occurs inaspecimen subjected totorsional
vibration, because shearing stresses arenotaccompanied byachange in
temperature.
Apolycrystalline specimen which issubjected tocompletely uniform
stress canshow relaxation duetointergranular thermal currents arising
from thefluctuations instress from grain tograin. The localized stress
differences from grain tograin areduetotheelastic anisotropy ofindi-
vidual grains. The relaxation peak duetointergranular thermal cur-
rents willnotoccur atasharp frequency and, therefore, represent asingle
relaxation time. Thefrequency atwhich therelaxation willoccur is
related tothegrain size ofthemetal. Internal friction duetointer-
granular thermal currents canoccur for alltypes ofstressing. Itis
important that effects from thissource beconsidered inexperiments
where theprime interest isindamping from other sources.

Theinternal friction ofmetals isquite sensitive toplastic deformation.
The effects areverycomplex anddepend onvariables such astheamount

duced intothemetal, thepurity ofthemetal, thefrequency ofvibration,
andthetimebetween thedeformation andthemeasurement ofinternal
friction. Read^ demonstrated that internal friction arising from cold
work isstrongly amplitude-dependent, even forstrain amplitudes as
small as10^^.
Afreshly cold-worked metal hasarelatively high internal friction which
anneals outvery rapidly attemperatures wellbelow those required for
recrystallization. Thehighdamping isalsoaccompanied byadecrease
inthedynamic modulus. Astheinternal friction anneals out, the
dynamic modulus returns toitssteady-state value. The decrease in
modulus duetocoldwork which canbeeliminated byannealing atrela-
tively lowtemperatures iscalled themodulus defect, ortheKoster effect.^
Mott hasproposed adislocation modeP forthemodulus defect which is
based onthebowing outunder stress ofanetwork ofdislocation lines
anchored atnodes andimpurities. Thetheory predicts thatthemodulus
defect isproportional totheproducts ofthedislocation length percubic
centimeter andthesquare oftheeffective loop length ofadislocation
segment,

Inacold-worked metal typical values ofA^"^^10'andLc^10~^cmwould
leadtovalues ofI\E/E of10percent, inagreement withobserved results.
Thedislocation mechanism fortheinternal-friction effects observed in
cold-worked metals isnotwellestablished. Thetheory duetoKoehler*
andGranato andLiicke^ assumes thatamplitude-dependent internal fric-
tion isduetoastress-strain hysteresis arising from theirreversibility of
dislocation linesbreaking away from pinning impurity atoms. However,
amplitude-independent internal friction isassumed toresult from a
viscouslike damping force acting onthebowed-out segments ofthedis-
location lines.
The only relaxation process which gives aninternal peak that is
definitely ascribable todislocations istheBordoni peak^ found infee
metals atverylowtemperatures intheregion of30to100°K. There
areindications that theBordoni peak isduetosome intrinsic property
ofdislocations and isnotinvolved with theinteraction ofdislocations
withimpurity atoms andother dislocations.

8-9.Dampins Capacity
This section isconcerned with theengineering aspects ofinternal fric-
tion. Thedamping capacity ofstructures andmachine elements iscon-
cerned with theinternal friction ofmaterials atstrain amplitudes and
stresses which aremuch greater than thevalues usually considered in
internal-friction experiments. Ahighdamping capacity isofpractical
engineering importance inlimiting theamplitude ofvibration atreso-
nance conditions andthereby reducing thelikelihood offatigue failure.
Turbine blades, crankshafts, and aircraft propellers aretypical applica-
tionswhere damping capacity isimportant.
Damping capacity canbedefined astheamount ofwork dissipated
intoheat perunitvolume ofmaterial percycle ofcompletely reversed
stress. Thedamping properties ofmaterials arefrequently expressed in

Values ofthesedamping parameters depend notonlyonthecondition of
thematerial butalsoontheshape and stress distribution ofthespeci-
mens. Since these conditions areoften notspecified, there isconsidera-

ingproperties ofmaterials. Theproposal hasbeenmade toexpress the
engineering damping properties ofmaterials hythe specific damping

Methods ofconverting logarithmic decrement anddamping capacity to
specific damping energy havebeen published.^
Engineering damping-capacity measurements arenotverydependent
upon frequency ofvibration. They are,however, strongly dependent on
thestress orstrain amplitude. Specific damping energy isapproximately

withnumber ofcycles ofstress reversal, themagnitude ofthe effect
increasing with stress level. Thedamping capacity foragiven metal

linear strain, which isobtained bydividing theelongation ofthegage
length ofthespecimen, 8,byitsoriginal length.
Since both thestress andthestrain areobtained bydividing theloadand
elongation byconstant factors, theload-elongation curve willhave the
same shape astheengineering stress-strain curve. Thetwocurves are
frequently used interchangeably.
Theshape andmagnitude ofthestress-strain curve ofametal will
depend onitscomposition, heattreatment, prior history ofplastic defor-
mation, andthestrain rate, temperature, and state ofstress imposed
during thetesting. Theparameters which areused todescribe thestress-
strain curve ofametal arethe tensile strength, yield strength oryield
point, percentelongation, andreduction ofarea. The firsttwoarestrength
parameters; thelasttwoindicate ductility.
Tensile Strengthr
The tensile strength, orultimate tensile strength (UTS), isthemaxi-
mum loaddivided bytheoriginal cross-sectional area ofthespecimen.
au=^(9-3)
The tensile strength isthevalue most often quoted from theresults ofa
tension test; yetinreality itisavalue oflittlefundamental significance
with regard tothestrength ofametal. Forductile metals thetensile
strength should beregarded asameasure ofthemaximum loadwhich a
metal canwithstand under thevery restrictive conditions ofuniaxial
loading. Itwillbeshown that thisvalue bears little relation totheuseful
strength ofthemetal under themore complex conditions ofstress which
areusually encountered. Formany years itwascustomary tobase the
strength ofmembers onthetensile strength, suitably reduced byafactor
ofsafety. Thecurrent trend istothemore rational approach ofbasing
the static design ofductile metals ontheyield strength. However,
because ofthelong practice ofusing thetensile strength todetermine
thestrength ofmaterials, ithasbecome avery familiar property, andas
such itisavery useful identification ofamaterial inthesame sense that
thechemical composition serves toidentify ametal oralloy. Further,
because thetensile strength iseasy todetermine and isaquite repro-
ducible property, itisuseful forthepurposes ofspecifications and for
quality control ofaproduct. Extensive empirical correlations between
tensile strength andproperties such ashardness andfatigue strength are

often quite useful. For brittle materials, thetensile strength isavalid
criterion fordesign.
Yield Strength
Theyield strength istheloadcorresponding toasmall specified plastic
strain divided bytheoriginal cross-sectional area ofthespecimen.
^6=0.002 ,p,..
c^o=—2(9-4)
Because ofthepractical difficulties ofmeasuring theelastic limit orpro-
portional limit, theyield strength and yield point arethepreferred
engineering parameters forexpressing thestart ofplastic deformation.
When thedesign ofaductile metal requires that plastic deformation
beprevented, theyield strength istheappropriate criterion ofthe
strength ofthemetal. Animportant feature oftheyield strength is
thatthevalue determined from thetension testcanbeused topredict
theconditions forstatic yielding under other, morecomplex conditions of
stress bymeans ofthedistortion-energy yielding criterion (Sec. 3-4).
Anexample ofthis isthedetermination oftheelastic-breakdown pressure
ofthick-wall tubes subjected tointernal pressure from theresults ofa
tension test.^ The yield strength and yield point aremore sensitive
than thetensile strength todifferences inheattreatment andmethod of
testing.
Percentage Elongation
Thepercentage elongation istheratio oftheincrease inthelength of
thegage section ofthespecimen toitsoriginal length, expressed inper
cent.
%elongation =-^ =e/ (9-5)
where L/=gage length atfracture
Lo=original gage length
€f=conventional strain atfracture
Thenumerator inEq. (9-5) issimply thetotalmeasured elongation of
thespecimen. This value isinfluenced bythedeformation during the
necking ofthespecimen, andhence thevalue ofpercent elongation
depends somewhat onthespecimen gage length. Theelongation ofthe
specimen isuniform along thegage length uptothepoint ofmaximum
load. Beyond thispoint necking begins, andthedeformation isnolonger
uniform along thelength ofthespecimen. Thisuniform strain isofmore
fundamental importance than total strain tofracture, and itisalso of

some practical useinpredicting theformability ofsheet metal. How-
ever, theuniform elongation isnotusually determined inaroutine ten-
sion test, sothat, unless specifically stated, thepercentage elongation ifi
always based onthetotal elongation. Itisdetermined byputting the
broken tensile specimen together andmeasuring thechange ingage
length. The original gage length should always begiven inreporting
percentage elongation values.
Reduction ofArea
Thepercentage reduction ofarea istheratio ofthedecrease inthecross-
sectional area ofthetensile specimen after fracture totheoriginal area,
expressed inpercent.
An—AtReduction ofarea=q— ^ (9-6)
Thedetermination ofthereduction ofarea inthin sheet specimens is
difficult, and forthisreason itisusually notmeasured inthistype of
specimen. Forthicker, flat,rectangular tensile specimens, thearea after
fracture maybeapproximated by
A=^{a^2d) (9-7)
where h,=width ofspecimen
a=thickness atcenter ofspecimen
d=thickness atends ofcross section ofspecimen
Theelongation andreduction ofarea areusually notdirectly useful to
thedesigner. There appear tobenoquantitative methods fordetermin-
ingtheminimum elongation orreduction ofareawhich amaterial must
have foraparticular design application. However, aqualitative indica-
tion offormability ofametal cansometimes beobtained from these
values. Ahigh reduction ofarea indicates theability ofthemetal to
deform extensively without fracture (seeProb. 9.4).
The reduction ofarea isthemost structure-sensitive parameter
that ismeasured inthetension test. Therefore, itsmost important
aspect isthat itisused asanindication ofmaterial quality. Adecrease
inreduction ofareafrom aspecified level forwhich experience has
shown thatgood service performance willresult isawarning thatquality
issubstandard.
Modulus ofElasticity
Theslope oftheinitial linear portion ofthestress-strain curve isthe
modulus ofelasticity, orYoung's modulus. Themodulus ofelasticity
isameasure ofthestiffness ofthematerial. Thegreater themodulus.

thesmaller theelastic strain resulting from theapplication ofagiven
stress. Since themodulus ofelasticity isneeded forcomputing deflec-
tions ofbeams andother members, itisanimportant design value.
Themodulus ofelasticity isdetermined bythebinding forces between
atoms. Since these forces cannot bechanged without changing thebasic
nature ofthematerial, itfollows thatthemodulus ofelasticity isoneof
themost structure-insensitive ofthemechanical properties. Itisonly
slightly affected byalloying additions, heat treatment, orcoldwork.^
However, increasing thetemperature decreases themodulus ofelasticity.
Themodulus isusually measured atelevated temperatures byadynamic
method^ which measures themode andperiod ofvibration ofametal
specimen. Typical values ofthemodulus ofelasticity forcommon engi-
neering metals atdifferent temperatures aregiven inTable 9-1.

Allthese relations areonlyapproximations totheareaunder thestress-
strain curves. Further, thecurves donotrepresent thetruebehavior in
theplastic range, since they are allbased ontheoriginal area ofthe
specimen.
9-2. True-stress-True-strain Curve
Theengineering stress-strain curve doesnotgiveatrue indication of
thedeformation characteristics ofametal because itisbased entirely on
theoriginal dimensions ofthespecimen, andthese dimensions change
continuously during the test. Also, ductile metal which ispulled in
tension becomes unstable andnecksdown during thecourse ofthetest.
Because thecross-sectional area ofthespecimen isdecreasing rapidly at
thisstage inthetest,theloadrequired tocontinue deformation falls off.
Theaverage stress based onoriginal area likewise decreases, and this
produces thefall-ofT inthestress-strain curve beyond thepoint ofmaxi-
mum load. Actually, themetal continues tostrain-harden alltheway
uptofracture, sothatthestress required toproduce further deformation
should alsoincrease. Ifthetrue stress, based ontheactual cross-sectional
area ofthespecimen, isused, itisfound that thestress-strain curve
increases continuously uptofracture. Ifthestrain measurement isalso
based oninstantaneous measurements, thecurve which isobtained is
known asatrue-stress-true-strain curve. This isalsoknown asaflow
curve (Sec. 3-2) since itrepresents thebasic plastic-flow characteristics
ofthematerial. Anypoint ontheflowcurve canbeconsidered asthe
yield stress forametal strained intension bytheamount shown onthe
curve. Thus, iftheload isremoved atthispointandthen reapplied, the
material willbehave elastically throughout theentire range ofreloading.
Thetrue stress istheload atanyinstant divided bythecross-sectional
area ofthespecimen atthat instant.

strain curve islinear from themaximum load tofracture, while inother
cases itsslope continuously decreases uptofracture. Little significance
should beattached tothislinear region oftheflow curve. When neck-
ingoccurs, thetriaxial state ofstress that iscreated inthisregion increases
theaverage longitudinal stress needed tocontinue plastic flow. There-

ontherate ofdevelopment oftheneck. Thiscanbedifferent formate-

Thefollowing parameters areusually determined from thetrue stress-

True stress andstrainmay alsobedetermined from theconventional

equations implies that theaxial strain isuniformly distributed over the
gage length ofthespecimen, since their derivation isbased onthecon-

these equations areaccurate uptothebeginning ofnecking, butbeyond
thisstage themajor portion ofthestrain islocalized attheneckandthe

than the stress which would be

elongation along thelength ofatensile specimen. Theexact distribu-
tion ofstrain willdepend upon the
metal, thegage length, and the
shape ofthecross section ofthe
testsection. Ingeneral, thesofter
andmore ductile themetal, the
greater theamount ofdeformation
away from thenecked region.
Also, theshorter thegage length,
thegreater theinfluence oflocal-
izeddeformation attheneckonthe
total elongation ofthegage length.
Therefore, foragiven material, the
shorter thegage length, thegreater
thepercentage elongation. Itis
forthisreason that thespecimen gage length should always bereported
with thepercentage elongation.
Itisgenerally recognized that inorder tocompare elongation measure-
ments ofdifferent-sized specimens, thespecimens must begeometrically
similar; i.e.,theratio ofgage length todiameter must beconstant. In
theUnited States thestandard tensile specimen hasa0.505-in. diameter

Theuniform elongation isnotaffected byspecimen geometry, since
uptomaximum load thespecimen elongates andcontracts indiameter

thisreason theuniform elongation isamore fundamental measure of
ductility than theconventional percentage elongation.

stress andthestrain rate isdifficult because ofthemany experimental
problems associated withmeasuring tensile properties atvery rapid rates
ofdeformation. Among theexperimental problems isthatanadiabatic
condition iscreated athigh strain rates, causing thetemperature ofthe
specimen toincrease; there isnotenough time fortheheat ofplastic
deformation tobedissipated. Tests inwhich thespecimen ispulled at
aconstant true strain rate arenotreadily performed onconventional
testing machines. Although itisfairly easy tomaintain aconstant rate
ofcrosshead movement, thisdoesnotensure aconstant rate ofstrain in
thespecimen since therate ofstraining inthespecimen increases with
load, particularly during necking.
Nadai^ haspresented amathematical analysis oftheconditions exist-

crosshead velocity isy=dL/dt. The strain rateexpressed interms of

Because ofthecommercial importance offerrous materials, agreat deal
ofwork hasbeendone incorrelating their tensile properties withcomposi-
tionandmicrostructure. Ithasbeen clearly demonstrated thatmicro-
structure isthechief metallurgical variable which controls thetensile
properties ofsteels. Because ofthewide variety ofmicrostructures which
arepossible withchanges incomposition andheattreatment, this isavery
interesting, yetsomewhat complex, subject.
The tensile properties ofannealed andnormalized steels arecontrolled
bytheflowandfracture characteristics oftheferrite andbytheamount,
shape, anddistribution ofthecementite. Thestrength oftheferrite
depends ontheamount ofalloying elements insolid solution (seeFig.5-9)
andtheferrite grain size. Thecarbon content hasavery strong effect
because itcontrols theamount ofcementite present either aspearlite or
asspheroidite. The strength increases and ductility decreases with
increasing carbon content because oftheincreased amount ofcementite
inthemicrostructure. Anormalized steel willhave higher strength than
anannealed steel because themore rapid rate ofcooling used inthe
normalizing treatment causes thetransformation topearlite tooccur ata
lower temperature, andafiner pearlite spacing results. Differences in
tensile properties duetotheshape ofthecementite particles areshown in
Fig. 9-16, where thetensile properties ofaspheroidized structure are
compared with apearlitic structure forasteel with thesame carbon
content. Empirical correlations havebeenworked out^between composi-
tionandcooling rate forpredicting thetensile properties ofsteels with
pearlitic structures.

Hardenahility, theproperty ofasteelwhich determines thedepth and
distribution ofhardness induced byquenching, should bedifferentiated
from hardness, which istheproperty ofamaterial which represents its
resistance toindentation ordeformation. (This subject isdiscussed in
Chap. 11.) Hardness isassociated with strength, while hardenability
isconnected with thetransformation characteristics ofasteel. Harden-
ability maybeincreased byaltering thetransformation kinetics bythe
addition ofalloying elements, while thehardness ofasteel with given
transformation kinetics iscontrolled primarily bythecarbon content.

ature isincreased, thedeviation intheproperties ofslack-quenched steel
from those oftempered martensite becomes smaller. Insteels with suf-
ficient hardenability toform 100percentmartensite itisfrequently found
that not alltheaustenite istransformed tomartensite onquenching.
Studies' haveshown that thegreatest effect ofretained austenite on
tensile properties isindecreasing theyield strength.
9-1 1.Anisotropy ofTensile Properties
Itisfrequently found that thetensile properties ofwrought-metal
products arenotthesame inalldirections. Thedependence ofproper-
tiesonorientation iscalled anisotropy. Two general types ofanisotropy
arefound inmetals. Crystallographic anisotropy results from thepre-
ferred orientation ofthegrains which isproduced bysevere deformation.
Since thestrength ofasingle crystal ishighly anisotropic, asevere plastic
deformation which produces astrong preferred orientation willcause a
polycrystalline specimen toapproach theanisotropy ofasingle crystal.
The yield strength, and toalesser extent thetensile strength, arethe
properties most affected. The yield strength inthedirection perpen-
dicular tothemain (longitudinal) direction ofworking maybegreater
orlessthan theyield strength inthelongitudinal direction, depending
upon thetype ofpreferred orientation which exists. This type ofani-
sotropy ismost frequently found innonferrous metals, especially when
theyhavebeen severely worked into sheet. Crystallographic anisotropy
canbeeliminated byrecrystallization, although theformation ofa
recrystallization texture cancause thereappearance ofadifferent type
ofanisotropy. Apractical manifestation ofcrystallographic anisotropy
istheformation of"ears," ornonuniform deformation indeep-drawn
cups. Crystallographic anisotropy may alsoresult intheelliptical defor-
mation ofatensile specimen.
Mechanical fihering isduetothepreferred alignment ofstructural dis-
continuities such asinclusions, voids, segregation, andsecond phases in
thedirection ofworking. Thistype ofanisotropy isimportant inforg-
ingsand plates. The principal direction ofworking isdefined asthe
longitudinal direction. This isthelong axis ofabarortherolling direc-
tion inasheet orplate. Two transverse directions must beconsidered.
The short-transverse direction istheminimum dimension oftheproduct,

Inaround orsquare, both these transverse directions areequivalent,
while inasheet theproperties intheshort-transverse direction cannot be

palcause ofdirectional properties. Measures ofductility likereduction

from acup-and-cone fracture toafracture ona45°plane. Ifthespeci-
mens were twisted tothis strain andthen untwisted, there was little
effect ofthetorsional deformation onthefracture stress, ductility, or
type offracture. Ininterpreting these results itwassuggested^ thatthe
twisting produced apreferred orientation ofinitially randomly oriented
microcracks. Thecracks werepresumed tobecome oriented along the
helical surface, which isincompression during twisting (see Fig. 10-4).
Separation occurs along this45°planewhen axial tension isapplied. The
cracks wereassumed tobecome reoriented inthelongitudinal direction
ofthebarwhen itwasuntwisted, andwith thisorientation theywould
have little effect onthetensile properties. Although therewasnoreal
experimental evidence fortheexistence ofmicrocracks, itwasconsidered
that they could beinitiated atinclusions andsecond-phase particles.
However, similar experiments^ withOFHC copper, inwhich there were
nosecond-phase particles andnopreferred orientation, confirmed and
extended Swift's observations. Themechanical anisotropy which was
observed wasexplained ontheassumption that themetal contained a
fibrous flaw structure, which hasthecharacteristics ofsubmicroscopic
cracks. There issome indication that these cracks originate during
solidification oftheingot andperhaps during plastic deformation, when
they areoriented intheprincipal working direction.

THETORSION TEST
10-1. Introduction
The torsion testhasnotmetwith thewide acceptance andtheuse
thathave been given thetension test. However, itisuseful inmany
engineering applications and also intheoretical studies ofplastic flow.
Torsion tests aremade onmaterials todetermine such properties asthe
modulus ofelasticity inshear, thetorsional yield strength, andthe
modulus ofrupture. Torsion tests alsomaybecarried outonfull-sized
parts, such asshafts, axles, andtwist drills, which aresubjected totor-
sional loading inservice. Itisfrequently used fortesting brittle mate-
rials, such astool steels, andhasbeen used intheform ofahigh-tem-
perature twist testtoevaluate theforgeability ofmaterials. Thetorsion
testhasnotbeen standardized tothesame extent asthetension test
and israrely required inmaterials specifications.
Torsion-testing equipment consists ofatwisting head, with achuck for
gripping thespecimen andforapplying thetwisting moment tothespeci-
men,andaweighing head, which grips theother end ofthespecimen
andmeasures thetwisting moment, ortorque. Thedeformation ofthe
specimen ismeasured byatwist-measuring device called atroptometer.
Determination ismade oftheangular displacement ofapoint nearone
end ofthetestsection ofthespecimen with respect toapoint onthe
same longitudinal element attheopposite end.Atorsion specimen
generally hasacircular cross section, since thisrepresents thesimplest
geometry forthecalculation ofthe stress. Since intheelastic range
theshear stress varies linearly from avalue ofzero atthecenter ofthe
bartoamaximum value atthesurface, itisfrequently desirable totest
athin-walled tubular specimen. This results inanearly uniform shear
stress over thecross section ofthespecimen.

stress corresponding tothetwisting moment from theappropriate equa-
tions given above. Atubular specimen isusually required foraprecision
measurement ofthetorsional elastic limit oryield strength. Because of
thestress gradient across thediameter ofasolidbarthesurface fibers are
restrained from yielding bythelesshighly stressed inner fibers. Thus,
the first onset ofyielding isgenerally notreadily apparent with the
instruments ordinarily used formeasuring theangle oftwist. Theuse
ofathin-walled tubular specimen minimizes this effect because thestress
gradient ispractically eliminated. Care should betaken, however, that
thewallthickness isnotreduced toogreatly, orthespecimen will failby
buckling rather than torsion. Experience hasshown that fordetermi-
nations oftheshearing yield strength andmodulus ofelasticity theratio
ofthelength ofthereduced testsection totheoutside diameter should be
about 10andthediameter-thickness ratio should beabout 8to10.
Once thetorsional yield strength hasbeen exceeded theshear-stress
distribution from thecenter tothesurface ofthespecimen isnolonger
linear andEq. (10-3) or(10-4) does not strictly apply. However, an
ultimate torsional shearing strength, ormodulus ofrupture, isfrequently
determined bysubstituting themaximum measured torque into these

276 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 10
equations. The results obtained bythisprocedure overestimate the
ultimate shear stress. Amore precise method ofcalculating thisvalue
willbediscussed inthenext section. Although theprocedure just
described results inconsiderable error, forthepurpose ofcomparing and
selecting materials itisgenerally sufficiently accurate. Forthedetermi-
nation ofthemodulus ofrupture with tubular specimens, theratio of
gage length todiameter should beabout 0.5andthediameter-thickness
ratioabout 10to12.

Torsion failures aredifferent from tensile failures inthat there islittle
localized reduction ofarea orelongation. Aductile metal failsbyshear
along oneoftheplanes ofmaximum shear stress. Generally theplane
ofthefracture isnormal tothelongitudinal axis (see Fig. 10-5a). A
brittle material fails intorsion along aplane perpendicular tothedirec-
tion ofthemaximum tensile stress. Since thisplane bisects theangle
between thetwoplanes ofmaximum shear stress andmakes anangle of
45°with thelongitidunal andtransverse directions, itresults inahelical
fracture (Fig. 10-56). Fractures aresometimes observed inwhich the

started onaplane ofmaximum shear stress parallel with theaxis ofthe
specimen. Astudy oftorsion failures inatool steel asafunction of
hardness^ showed thatfracture started onplanes ofmaximum shear stress
uptoaVickers hardness of720andthatabove thishardness tensile
stresses were responsible forstarting fracture.
10-5. Torsion Test vs.Tension Test
Agood casecanbemade fortheposition advanced bySauveur^ that
thetorsion testprovides amore fundamental measure oftheplasticity
ofametal than thetension test. Foronething, thetorsion testyields
directly ashear-stress-shear-strain curve. Thistype ofcurve hasmore
fundamental significance incharacterizing plastic behavior than astress-
strain curve determined intension. Large values ofstrain canbe
obtained intorsion without complications such asnecking intension or
barreling due tofrictional end effects incompression. Moreover, in
torsion, tests canbemade fairly easily atconstant orhigh strain rates.
Ontheother hand, considerable labor isinvolved inconverting torque-
angle-of-twist data intoshear-stress-strain curves. Furthermore, unless
atubular specimen isused, there willbeasteep stress gradient across
thespecimen. This willmake itdifficult tomake accurate measure-
ments oftheyield strength.

considered that plastic deformation occurs onreaching acritical value of

opportunity forductile behavior isgreater intorsion than intension.

The tensile stress-strain curve canbederived from thecurve fortor-

When both curves areplotted interms ofsignificant stress and signifi-
cant strain (thetension curve isunchanged), thetwocurves superimpose
within fairly close limits. Anumber ofexamples ofthiscanbefound in
theliterature.*'^ Also, astraight line isobtained fortorsion datawhen
thelogarithm ofsignificant stress isplotted against thelogarithm ofsig-
nificant strain.^ Thevalues ofKandnobtained from these curves agree
fairly wellwithcomparable values obtained from thetension test.

THEHARDNESS TEST
11-1. Introduction
Thehardness ofamaterial isapoorly defined termwhich hasmany
meanings depending upon theexperience oftheperson involved. In
general, hardness usually implies aresistance todeformation, and for
metals theproperty isameasure oftheir resistance topermanent or
plastic deformation. Toaperson concerned withthemechanics ofmate-
rials testing, hardness ismost likely tomean theresistance toindentation,
andtothedesign engineer itoftenmeans aneasily measured andspeci-
fiedquantity which indicates something about thestrength andheat
treatment ofthemetal. There arethree general types ofhardness
measurements depending upon themanner inwhich thetest iscon-
ducted. These are (1)scratch hardness, (2)indentation hardness, and
(3)rebound, ordynamic, hardness. Only indentation hardness isof
major engineering interest formetals.
Scratch hardness isofprimary interest tomineralogists. With this
measure ofhardness, various minerals andother materials arerated on
their ability toscratch oneanother. Hardness ismeasured according to
theMohs scale. This consists of10standard minerals arranged inthe
order oftheir ability tobescratched. The softest mineral inthisscale
istalc (scratch hardness 1),while diamond hasahardness of10.A
fingernail hasavalue ofabout 2,annealed copper hasavalue of3,and
martensite ahardness of7.TheMohs scale isnotwellsuited formetals
since theintervals arenotwidely spaced inthehigh-hardness range.
Most hard metals fallintheMohs hardness range of4to8.Adifferent
type ofscratch-hardness test^measures thedepth orwidth ofascratch
made bydrawing adiamond stylus across thesurface under adefinite
load. This isauseful tool formeasuring therelative hardness ofmicro-
constituents, but itdoesnotlend itself tohigh reproducibility orextreme
accuracy.
Indynamic-hardness measurements theindenter isusually dropped

onto themetal surface, andthehardness isexpressed astheenergy of
impact. TheShore sceleroscope, which isthecommonest example ofa
dynamic-hardness tester, measures thehardness interms oftheheight
ofrebound oftheindenter.
11-2. Brinell Hardness
The firstwidely accepted andstandardized indentation-hardness test
wasproposed byJ.A.Brinell in1900. The Brinell hardness testcon-
sists inindenting themetal surface with a10-mm-diameter steel ballat
aload of3,000 kg.For softmetals theload isreduced to500kgto
avoid toodeepanimpression, andforveryhard metals atungsten car-
bide ball isused tominimize distortion oftheindenter. Theload is
applied forastandard time, usually 30sec,andthediameter oftheinden-
tation ismeasured withalow-power microscope afterremoval oftheload.
Theaverage oftworeadings ofthediameter oftheimpression atright
angles should bemade. Thesurface onwhich theindentation ismade
should berelatively smooth and freefrom dirtorscale. The Brinell
hardness number (BHN) isexpressed astheloadPdivided bythesurface
area oftheindentation. This isexpressed bytheformula^
BHN= ^
, (11-1)
(tD/2){D -VD^-d^)
whereP=applied load,kg
D=diameter ofball,mm
d=diameter ofindentation, mm
Itwillbenoticed that theunits oftheBHN arekilograms persquare
millimeter. However, theBHN isnotasatisfactory physical concept
since Eq.(11-1) doesnotgivethemean pressure over thesurface ofthe
indentation.
Ingeneral, theBrinell hardness number ofamaterial isconstant only
foroneapplied loadanddiameter ofball. Ithasbeenshown that in
order toobtain thesame Brinell hardness number atanonstandard load
geometrical similitude must bemaintained. This requires thattheratio
oftheindentation totheindenter, d/D,remains constant. Toafirst
approximation thiscanbeattained whenPID^ iskept constant.
Thegreatest error inBrinell hardness measurements occurs inmeasur-
ingthediameter oftheimpression. Itisassumed that thediameter of
theindentation isthesame asthediameter when theballwas incon-
tactwith themetal. However, owing toelastic recovery, theradius of
curvature oftheindentation willbelarger than that ofthespherical

thereferences intheBibliography attheendofthischapter.

284 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 11
indenter, although theindentation will stillbesymmetrical. Theharder
themetal, thegreater theelastic recovery. Elastic recovery willaffect
measurements ofthedepth ofindentation, but itwillhave only anegli-
gible effect onthechordal diameter oftheimpression, sothat thisdoes
notingeneral influence Brinell hardness. However, twotypes ofanoma-
lousbehavior canoccur asaresult oflocalized deformation ofthemetal
attheindentation. These areshown schemat-
ically incross section through theindentation
inFig. 11-1. Thesketch atthetopillustrates
"ridging," or''piling up," inwhich alipofmetal
forms around theedge oftheimpression. This
behavior ismostcommon incold-worked metals
with little ability tostrain-harden. Themeasured
diameter isgreater than thetruediameter ofthe
impression, butsince theridge carries part ofthe
load, itiscustomary tobasethehardness measure-
ment onthediameter dshown inthesketch. The
drawing onthebottom shows ''sinking in," in
which there isadepression ofthemetal attherim
oftheindentation. Thistype ofbehavior iscom-
mon with annealed metals having ahigh rate of
strain hardening. Thetruediameter oftheimpres-
sioncansometimes beobtained bycoating theballwith bluing ordye
before making theindentation. Itisfrequently desirable toincrease
thesharpness ofdefinition oftheimpression sothatthediameter canbe
measured more accurately. This cansometimes bedonebyusing a
lightly etched steel ball orbycoating thesurface with adullblack
pigment.Fig.11-1. Cross sections

Meyer^ suggested thatamore rational definition ofhardness than that
proposed byBrinell would beonebased onthe'projected area oftheimpres-
sionrather than thesurface area. Themean pressure between thesur-
face oftheindenter andtheindentation isequal totheloaddivided by
theprojected area oftheindentation.
Meyer proposed that thismean pressure should betaken asthemeasure
ofhardness. Itisreferred toastheMeyer hardness.

Like theBrinell hardness, Meyer hardness hasunits ofkilograms per
square millimeter. TheMeyer hardness islesssensitive totheapplied
loadthan theBrinell hardness. Foracold-worked material theMeyer
hardness isessentially constant andindependent ofload, while theBrinell
hardness decreases astheload increases. Foranannealed metal the
Meyer hardness increases continuously with theloadbecause ofstrain
hardening produced bytheindentation. TheBrinell hardness, however,
first increases with loadandthen decreases for stillhigher loads. The
Meyer hardness isamorefundamental measure ofindentation hardness;
yet itisrarely used forpractical hardness measurements.
Meyer proposed anempirical relation between theloadandthesizeof
theindentation. This relationship isusually called Meyer's law.

Theparameter n'istheslope ofthestraight lineobtained when logPis
plotted against logd,andkisthevalue ofPat c?=1.Fully annealed
metals have avalue ofn'ofabout 2.5,while n'isapproximately 2for
fully strain-hardened metals. Thisparameter isroughly related tothe
strain-hardening coefficient intheexponential equation forthetrue-
stress-true-strain curve. Theexponent inMeyer's law isapproximately
equal tothestrain-hardening coefficient plus 2.
When indentations aremade with balls ofdifferent diameters, different
values ofkand n'willbeobtained.

Meyer found that n'wasalmost independent ofthediameter ofthe

Several interesting conclusions result from Eq. (11-4). First, thisequa-

Since dlDmust beconstant forgeometrically similar indentations, the

Meyer hardness. Therefore, geometrically similar indentations givethe

Remembering again thatgeometrically similar indentations areobtained
whend/D isconstant, weseethat theabove equation shows that the
ratioP/D^ must alsoprovide thesame result. Therefore, thesame
hardness values willbeobtained when theratioF/D^ iskept constant.
There isalower limit ofloadbelow which Meyer's law isnotvalid.
Iftheload istoosmall, thedeformation around theindentation isnot
fully plastic andEq.(11-3) isnotobeyed. This load willdepend upon
thehardness ofthemetal. Fora10-mm-diameter balltheloadshould
exceed 50kgforcopper with aBHN of100,andforsteelwith aBHN
of400theloadshould exceed 1,500 kg.Forballs ofdifferent diameter
thecritical loads willbeproportional tothesquare ofthediameter.

Therefore, thedeformation under theindenter iselastic until themean
pressure reaches about 1.1times theyield stress. Atabout thispressure
plastic deformation begins inthevicinity ofpoint (Fig. ll-2a). Asthe
load isfurther increased, themean pressure increases andtheplastically
deformed region grows until itcontains theentire region ofcontact (Fig.
11-26). Ananalytical solution forthepressure between thespherical
indenter andtheindentation under conditions offullplasticity isvery
difficult. Thebest analysis ofthisproblem indicates thatpm«2.66cro.
Meyer hardness tests onseverely cold-worked metal indicates that full
plasticity occurs when

Foranideally plastic metal thepressure would remain constant atthis
value iftheloadwere increased further. Since realmetals strain-harden,
thepressure would increase owing toanincrease ino-oastheindentation
process wascontinued. Most Brinell hardness tests arecarried out
under conditions where fullplasticity isreached. This isalsoaneces-
sarycondition forMeyer's lawtobevalid.
11-5. Relationship between Hardness andtheTensile-How Curve
Tabor^ hassuggested amethod bywhich theplastic region ofthe
true stress-strain curvemaybedetermined from indentation hardness
measurements. Themethod isbased onthefactthat there isasimi-
larity intheshape oftheflowcurve andthecurve obtained when the
Meyer hardness ismeasured onanumber ofspecimens subjected to
increasing amounts ofplastic strain. Themethod isbasically empirical,
since thecomplex stress distribution atthehardness indentation pre-
cludes astraightforward relationship with thestress distribution inthe
tension test. However, themethod hasbeenshown togivegood agree-
ment forseveral metals andthus should beofinterest asameans of
obtaining flowdata insituations where itisnotpossible tomeasure
tensile properties. The true stress (flow stress) isobtained from Eq.
(11-8), where coistobeconsidered theflow stress atagiven value of
true strain.

Thus, iftheMeyer hardness ismeasured under conditions suchthatd/D
varies from thesmallest value forfullplasticity uptolarge values and
Eqs. (11-8) and (11-9) areused, it

'ispossible atleast toapproximate
thetensile-fiow curve. Figure 11-3
shows theagreement which has
been obtained byTabor between
theflowcurveandhardness versus
d/D curve formild steelandan-
nealed copper. Tabor's results
have been verified byLenhart^
forduralumin andOFHC copper.
However, Tabor's analysis didnot
predict theflow curve formag-
nesium, which wasattributed by
Lenhart tothehigh anisotropy of
deformation inthis metal. This
work should notdetract from the
usefulness ofthis correlation but,
rather, should serve toemphasize
that itslimitations should bein-
vestigated fornewapplications.
There isavery useful engineer-
ingcorrelation between theBrinell hardness andtheultimate tensile
strength ofheat-treated plain-carbon andmedium-alloy steels.
Ultimate tensile strength, inpounds persquare inch,=500(BHN).
Abrief consideration willshow that this isinagreement with Tabor's
results. Ifwemake thesimplifying assumption that this class ofmate-
rials does notstrain-harden, then thetensile strength isequal tothe

Itshovild nowbeapparent why thesame relationship doesnothold for
other metals. P'orexample, forannealed copper theassumption that
strain hardening canbeneglected willbegrossly inerror. Forametal
with greater capability forstrain hardening the"constant" ofpropor-
tionality willbegreater than thatused forheat-treated steel.
11-6. Vickers Hardness
TheVickers hardness testusesasquare-base diamond pyramid asthe
indenter. Theincluded angle between opposite faces ofthepyramid is
136°. This anglewaschosen because itapproximates themost desirable
ratio ofindentation diameter toballdiameter intheBrinell hardness test.
Because oftheshape oftheindenter this isfrequently called thediamond-
pyramid hardness test. Thediamond-pyramid hardness number (DPH),
orVickers hardness number (VHN, orVPH), isdefined astheload
divided bythesurface area oftheindentation. Inpractice, thisarea is
calculated from microscopic measurements ofthelengths ofthediagonals
oftheimpression. TheDPHmay bedetermined from thefollowing
equation,
DPH=^^%W2) ^1^ („.,0)
whereP=applied load,kg
L=average length ofdiagonals, mm
6=angle between opposite faces ofdiamond =136"
The Vickers hardness testhasreceived fairly wide acceptance for
research work because itprovides acontinuous scale ofhardness, fora
given load, from very softmetals with aDPH of5toextremely hard
materials with aDPH of1,500. With theRockwell hardness test,
described inthenext section, ortheBrinell hardness test, itisusually
necessary tochange either theload ortheindenter atsome point inthe
hardness scale, sothatmeasurements atoneextreme ofthescale cannot
bestrictly compared with those attheother end. Because theimpres-
sionsmadebythepyramid indenter aregeometrically similar nomatter
what their size,theDPH should beindependent ofload. This isgener-
allyfound tobethecase, except atvery light loads. Theloads ordinarily
usedwith thistestrange from 1to120kg,depending onthehardness of
themetal tobetested. Inspite ofthese advantages, theVickers hard-
ness testhasnotbeen widely accepted forroutine testing because itis
slow, requires careful surface preparation ofthespecimen, andallows
greater chance forpersonal error inthedetermination ofthediagonal
length.

earlier forBrinell impressions arefrequently observed with apyramid
indenter (Fig. 11-4). Thepincushion indentation inFig. 11-46 isthe

Thediagonal measurement inthiscaseproduces alowvalue ofthecon-
tr.ctarea sothatthehardness numbers areerroneously high. Empirical
corrections forthis effect have been proposed.^
11-7. Rockwell Hardness Test
Themost widely usedhardness testintheUnited States istheRock-
wellhardness test. Itsgeneral acceptance isduetoitsspeed, freedom
from personal error, ability todistinguish small hardness differences in
hardened steel, andthesmall size oftheindentation, sothat finished
heat-treated parts canbetested without damage. This test utilizes the
depth ofindentation, under constant load, asameasure ofhardness. A
minor load of10kgisfirstapplied toseatthespecimen. Thisminimizes
theamount ofsurface preparation needed andreduces thetendency for
ridging orsinking inbytheindenter. Themajor load isthen applied,
andthedepth ofindentation isautomatically recorded onadialgage in
terms ofarbitrary hardness numbers. The dialcontains 100divisions,
each division representing apenetration of0.00008 in.The dial is
reversed sothatahigh hardness, which corresponds toasmall penetra-
tion, results inahighhardness number. This isinagreement with the
other hardness numbers described previously, butunlike theBrinell and
Vickers hardness designations, which have units ofkilograms persquare
miUimeter, theRockwell hardness numbers arepurely arbitrary.
Onecombination ofloadandindenter willnotproduce satisfactory
results formaterials with awide range ofhardness A120°diamond
conewith aslightly rounded point, called aBrale indenter, and }/{&-and
3/^-in. -diameter steel balls aregenerally used asindenters. Major loads
of60,100,and150kgareused. Since theRockwell hardness isdepend-
entontheloadandindenter, itisnecessary tospecify thecombination

which isused. This isdonebyprefixing thehardness number with a
letter indicating theparticular combination ofloadandindenter forthe
hardness scale employed. ARockwell hardness number without the
letter prefix ismeaningless. Hardened steel istested ontheCscale with
thediamond indenter anda150-kg major load. The useful range for
this scale isfrom about Re20toRe70. Softer materials areusually
tested ontheBscale with a3^i6-in. -diameter steel ballanda100-kg
major load. Therange ofthisscale isfromRb toRb100.TheAscale
(diamond penetrator, 60-kg major load) provides themost extended
Rockwell hardness scale, which isusable formaterials from annealed
brass tocemented carbides. Many other scales areavailable forspecial
purposes.^
TheRockwell hardness test isavery useful andreproducible onepro-
vided that anumber ofsimple precautions areobserved. Most ofthe
points listed below apply ecjually welltotheother hardness tests:
1.Theindenter andanvil should becleanandwellseated.
2.Thesurface tobetested should beclean, dry,smooth, andfreefrom
oxide. Arough-ground surface isusually adequate fortheRockwell test.
3.Thesurface should beflatandperpendicular totheindenter.
4.Tests oncylindrical surfaces willgivelowreadings, theerrordepend-
ingonthecurvature, load, indenter, andhardness ofthematerial. Theo-
retieal^ andempirical^ corrections forthis effect havebeen published.
5.Thethickness ofthespecimen should besuch thatamark orbulge
isnotproduced onthereverse side ofthepiece. Itisrecommended that
thethickness beatleast tentimes thedepth oftheindentation. Tests
should bemade ononly asingle thickness ofmaterial.
6.Thespacing between indentations should bethree tofivetimes the
diameter oftheindentation.
7.Thespeed ofapplication oftheloadshould bestandardized. This
isdonebyadjusting thedashpot ontheRockwell tester. Variations in
hardness canbeappreciable invery softmaterials unless therate ofload
application iscarefully controlled. Forsuch materials theoperating
handle oftheRockwell tester should bebrought back assoon asthe
major loadhasbeen fully applied.

testhasbeenfound tobemore useful.^ Thedevelopment oftheKnoop
indenter bytheNational Bureau ofStandards andtheintroduction of
theTukon tester forthecontrolled application ofloadsdown to25g
havemade microhardness testing aroutine laboratory procedure.
TheKnoop indenter isadiamond ground toapyramidal form that
produces adiamond-shaped indentation withthelongandshort diagonals
intheapproximate ratio of7:1.Thedepth ofindentation isabout one-
thirtieth ofthelength ofthelonger diagonal. TheKnoop hardness num-

Thelowloadusedwithmicrohardness tests requires thatextreme care
betaken inallstages oftesting. Thesurface ofthespecimen must be
carefully prepared. Metallographic polishing isusually required. Work
hardening ofthesurface during polishing caninfluence theresults. The
longdiagonal oftheKnoop impression isessentially unaffected byelastic
recovery forloads greater thanabout 300 g.However, forlighter loads
thesmall amount ofelastic recovery becomes appreciable. Further,
with thevery small indentations produced atlight loads theerror in
locating theactual ends oftheindentation become greater. Both these
factors have theeffect ofgiving ahighhardness reading, sothat itis
usually observed thattheKnoop hardness number increases astheload
isdecreased below about 300 g.Tarasov andThibault- haveshown that
ifcorrections aremade forelastic recovery andvisual acuity theKnoop
hardness number isconstant with loaddown to100 g.

ahardness testdoes notmeasure awell-defined property ofamaterial
andsince allthetests incommon usearenotbased onthesame type of
measurements, itisnotsurprising thatnouniversal hardness-conversion
relationships havebeen developed. Itisimportant torealize thathard-
nessconversions areempirical relationships. Themost reliable hardness-
conversion data exist forsteelwhich isharder than 240 Brinell. The
ASTM, ASM, andSAE (Society ofAutomotive Engineers) have agreed
onatable ^forconversion between Rockwell, Brinell, anddiamond-
pyramid hardness which isapplicable toheat-treated carbon andalloy
steelandtoalmost allalloy constructional steels and tool steels inthe
as-forged, annealed, normalized, andquenched andtempered conditions.
However, different conversion tables arerequired formaterials with
greatly different elastic moduli, such astungsten carbide, orwith greater
strain-hardening capacity. Heyer^ hasshown thattheindentation hard-
ness ofsoftmetals depends onthestrain-hardening behavior ofthemate-
rialduring thetest,which inturn isdependent ontheprevious degree of
strain hardening ofthematerial before thetest. Asanextreme example
ofthecarewhich isrequired inusing conversion charts forsoftmetals,
itispossible forArmco ironand cold-rolled aluminum each tohave a
Brinell hardness of66;yettheformer hasaRockwell Bhardness of31
compared with ahardness ofRb7forthecold-worked aluminum. On
theother hand, metals such asyellow brass andlow-carbon sheet steel
have awell-behaved Brinell-Rockwell conversion^* relationship for all
degrees ofstrain hardening. Special hardness-conversion tables forcold-
worked aluminum, copper, and18-8 stainless steel aregiven intheASM
Metals Handbook.
11-10. Hardness atElevated Temperatures
Interest inmeasuring thehardness ofmetals atelevated temperatures
hasbeen accelerated bythegreat effort which hasgone intodeveloping
alloys withimproved high-temperature strength. Hothardness gives a
good indication ofthepotential usefulness ofanalloy forhigh-temper-
ature strength applications. Some degree ofsuccess hasbeen obtained
incorrelating hothardness with high-temperature strength properties.

perature which isabout one-half themelting point ofthemetal being
tested. Similar behavior isfound inplots ofthelogarithm ofthetensile
strength against temperature. Figure 11-5shows thisbehavior for
copper. Itislikely that thischange inslope isduetoachange inthe
deformation mechanism athigher temperature. Theconstant Aderived
from thelow-temperature branch ofthecurve canbeconsidered tobe
theintrinsic hardness ofthemetal, that is,Hat0°K. Thisvalue would
beexpected tobeameasure oftheinherent strength ofthebinding forces
ofthe lattice. Westbrook correlated values ofAfordifferent metals
with theheatcontent oftheliquid metal atthemelting pointandwith
themelting point. This correlation was sensitive tocrystal structure.
Theconstant B,derived from theslope ofthecurve, isthetemperature
coefficient ofhardness. This constant wasrelated inarather complex
way totherate ofchange ofheat content with increasing temperature.
With these correlations itispossible tocalculate fairly wellthehardness
ofapuremetal asafunction oftemperature uptoabout one-half its
melting point.
Hardness measurements asafunction oftemperature willshow an
abrupt change atthetemperature atwhich anallotropic transformation
occurs. Hot-hardness testsonCo,Fe,Ti,U,andZrhaveshown^ that
thebody-centered cubic lattice isalways thesofter structure when itis
involved inanallotropic transformation. Theface-centered cubic and
hexagonal close-packed lattices have approximately thesame strength,
while highly complex crystal structures giveevenhigher hardness. These
results areinagreement withthefactthataustenitic iron-base alloys have
better high-temperature strength than ferritic alloys.

FATIGUE OFMETALS
12-1. Introduction
Ithasbeen recognized since 1850thatametal subjected toarepetitive
orfluctuating stress will failatastressmuch lower than thatrequired to
cause fracture onasingle application ofload. Failures occurring under
conditions ofdynamic loading arecalled fatigue failures, presumably
because itisgenerally observed that these failures occur only after a
considerable period ofservice. Foralongtime thenotion persisted that
fatigue wasdueto"crystallization" ofthemetal, butthisview canno
longer beconsidered inthelight ofconcepts which hold thatametal is
crystalline from thetime ofsolidification from themelt. Infact, there
isnoobvious change inthestructure ofametal which hasfailed in
fatigue which canserve asacluetoourunderstanding ofthereasons for
fatigue failure. Fatigue hasbecome progressively more prevalent as
technology hasdeveloped agreater amount ofequipment, such asauto-
mobiles, aircraft, compressors, pumps, turbines, etc.,subject torepeated
loading andvibration, untiltoday itisoften stated that fatigue accounts
foratleast90percent ofallservice failures duetomechanical causes.
Afatigue failure isparticularly insidious, because itoccurs without
anyobvious warning. Fatigue results inabrittle fracture, withnogross
deformation atthefracture. Onamacroscopic scale thefracture surface
isusually normal tothedirection oftheprincipal tensile stress. Afatigue
failure canusually berecognized from theappearance ofthefracture sur-
face,which shows asmooth region, duetotherubbing action asthecrack
propagated through thesection (topportion ofFig. 12-1), andarough
region, where themember hasfailed inaductile manner when thecross
section wasnolonger able tocarry theload. Frequently theprogress
ofthefracture isindicated byaseries ofrings, or"beach marks," pro-
gressing inward from thepoint ofinitiation ofthefailure. Figure 12-1
also illustrates another characteristic offatigue, namely, thatafailure
usually occurs atapoint ofstress concentration such asasharp corner or
notch oratametallurgical stress concentration likeaninclusion.
Three basic factors arenecessary tocause fatigue failure. These are

These willbediscussed later inthechapter.
Ascanbeseenfrom Fig. 12-3, thenumber ofcj^cles ofstress which a
metal canendure before failure increases with decreasing stress. Unless
otherwise indicated, Nistaken asthenumber ofcycles ofstress tocause
complete fracture ofthespecimen. This ismade upofthenumber of
cycles toinitiate acrackandthenumber ofcycles topropagate thecrack
completely through thespecimen. Usually nodistinction ismade
between these two factors, although itcanbeappreciated that the
number ofcycles forcrack propagation willvary with thedimensions
ofthespecimen. Fatigue tests atlowstresses areusually carried out
for10^cycles andsometimes to5X10^cycles fornonferrous metals.
Forafewimportant engineering materials such assteelandtitanium,
theS-Ncurve becomes horizontal atacertain limiting stress. Below
thislimiting stress, which iscalled thefatigue limit, orendurance limit,
thematerial canpresumably endure aninfinite number ofcycles without
failure. Most nonferrous metals, likealuminum, magnesium, andcopper
alloys, haveanS-Ncurve which slopes gradually downward with increas-
ingnumber ofcycles. These materials donothave atrue fatigue limit
because theS-Ncurve never becomes horizontal. Insuch cases itis
common practice tocharacterize thefatigue properties ofthematerial
bygiving thefatigue strength atanarbitrary number ofcycles, for
example, 10*cycles. Thereasons why certain materials have afatigue
limit arenotknown, although ahypothesis regarding thisimpor-
tantquestion willbediscussed later inthechapter.
Theusual procedure fordetermining anS-Ncurve istotestthe first
specimen atahigh stress where failure isexpected inafairly shortnum-
berofcycles, e.g., atabout two-thirds thestatic tensile strength ofthe
material. The teststress isdecreased foreachsucceeding specimen until
oneortwospecimens donot failinthespecified number ofcycles, which
isusually atleast10'^cycles. Thehighest stress atwhich arunout (non-
failure) isobtained istaken asthefatigue limit. Formaterials without
afatigue limit thetest isusually terminated forpractical considerations
atalowstress where the life isabout 10*or5X10*cycles. TheS-N
curve isusually determined withabout 8to12specimens. Itwillgener-
allybefound thatthere isaconsiderable amount ofscatter intheresults,
although asmooth curve canusually bedrawn through thepoints with-
outtoomuch difficulty. However, ifseveral specimens aretested atthe
same stress, there isagreatamount ofscatter intheobserved values of
number ofcycles tofailure, frequently asmuch asonelogcyclebetween
theminimum andmaximum value. Further, ithasbeenshown ^that

Aninteresting testforobtaining amore rapid estimate ofthefatigue
limitthan ispossible byconventional means wasproposed byProt.^ In
thismethod, each specimen isstarted ataninitial stress below the
expected value ofthefatigue limit, and the stress isprogressively
increased ataconstant rate until fracture occurs. Several specimens
aretested atdifferent values ofstress increase percycle. Protsuggested
thatalinear relationship should existbetween thestress atwhich frac-
tureoccurs andy/a,w^here aisthestress increase percycle. Thefatigue
limit isobtained from this plotbyextrapolation toy/a=0.Profs
method hasundergone considerable investigation andmodification' and
appears useful fortherapid determination ofthefatigue limit offerrous
materials.
Amodification oftheProtmethod issometimes used w^hen aspecial
machine equipped toprovide acontinuously increasing stress isnotavail-
able orwhen thenumber ofspecimens isnotlarge. The initial stress
level istaken atabout 70percent oftheestimated fatigue limit. The
test isrunforafixednumber ofcycles, forexample, 10^,and iffailure
doesnotoccur, thestress israised byacertain amount. Another unit
ofcycles isapplied atthis stress, andtheprocess iscontinued until failure
occurs. Thefatigue limit ofthespecimen istaken asthestress halfway
between thebreaking stress andthehighest stress atwhich thespecimen
survived. Results obtained bythisstepmethod andtheProtmethod
maynotproduce values offatigue limit inagreement withthose obtained
from testing atconstant stress, because ofchanges which canoccur in
themetal during testing atstresses below thefatigue limit. Forexample,
certain metals canbestrengthened b}^"coaxing" atstresses below the
fatigue limit. This topic isdiscussed ingreater detail inSec. 12-13.

itissufficiently accurate toassume alogarithmic normal distribution of
fatigue lifeatconstant lifeintheregion oftheprobability offailure of
P=0.10 toP=0.90. However, itisfrequently important tobeable
topredict thefatigue lifecorresponding toaprobability offailure of
1percent orless. Atthisextreme limit ofthedistribution theassump-
tion ofalog-normal distribution oflife isnolonger justified, although it
isfrequently used. Alternative approaches have been theuseofthe
extreme-value distribution ^orWeibull's distribution.-
Forthestatistical interpretation ofthefatigue limitweareconcerned
with thedistribution ofstress ataconstant fatigue life.The fatigue
limit ofsteelwasformerly considered tobeasharp threshold value,
below which allspecimens w^ould presumably have infinite lives. How-
ever, itisnow recognized that thefatigue limit isreally astatistical
quantity which requires special techniques foranaccurate determination.
Forexample, inaheat-treated alloy forging steel thestress range which
would include thefatigue limits of95percent ofthespecimens could
easily befrom 40,000 to52,000 psi.Anexample oftheerrors which can
beintroduced byordinary testing with afewspecimens isillustrated in
Fig. 12-5. This figure summarizes^ tenS-Ncurves determined inthe
conventional manner forthesame barofalloy steel, each curve being
based ontenspecimens. Thespecimens were asidentical asitwaspossi-
bletomake them, andtherewasnoexcessive scatter oruncertainty asto
howtodraw theS-Ncurves. Yet, ascanbeseenfrom thefigure, there is
considerable difference inthemeasured values ofthefatigue limit forthe
steelduetothefactthatthecurves werebased oninsufficient data.
Indetermining thefatigue limit ofamaterial, itshould berecognized
thateachspecimen has itsownfatigue limit, astress above which itwill
failbutbelow which itwillnot fail,andthat this critical stress varies
from specimen tospecimen forvery obscure reasons. Itisknown that
inclusions insteelhave animportant effect onthefatigue limitand its
variability, butevenvacuum-melted steelshows appreciable scatter in
fatigue limit. The statistical problem ofaccurately determining the
fatigue limit iscomplicated bythefactthatwecannot measure theindi-
vidual value ofthefatigue limit foranygiven specimen. Wecanonly
testaspecimen ataparticular stress, and ifthespecimen fails, then the
stress wassomewhere above thefatigue limit ofthespecimen. Since
thespecimen cannot beretested, even ifitdidnot failatthetest stress,

concerned with thestudy ofthebasic structural changes thatoccur ina
metal when itissubjected tocyclic stress. Fatigue hascertain things in

common with plastic flowand fracture under static orunidirectional
deformation. Thework ofGough^ hasshown that ametal deforms
under cyclic strain bysliponthesame atomic planes and inthesame
crystallographic directions asinunidirectional strain. Whereas with
unidirectional deformation slip isusually widespread throughout allthe
grains, infatigue some grains willshow sliplines while other grains will
givenoevidence ofslip. Slip lines aregenerally formed during the first
fewthousand cycles ofstress. Successive cycles produce additional slip
bands, butthenumber ofslipbands isnotdirectly proportional tothe
number ofcycles ofstress. Inmany metals theincrease invisible slip
soon reaches asaturation value, which isobserved asdistorted regions
ofheavy slip. Cracks areusually found tooccur intheregions ofheavy
deformation parallel towhatwasoriginally aslipband. Slipbands have
been observed atstresses below thefatigue limit offerrous materials.
Therefore, theoccurrence ofslipduring fatigue does notinitselfmean
thatacrack willform.
Astudy ofcrack formation infatigue canbefacilitated byinterrupting
thefatigue test toremove thedeformed surface byelectropolishing.
There willgenerally beseveral slipbands which aremore persistent than
therestandwhich willremain visible when theother sliplineshavebeen
polished away. Such slipbands have been observed after only 5per
cent ofthetotal lifeofthespecimen.^ These persistent slipbands are
embryonic fatigue cracks, since theyopen intowide cracks ontheappli-
cation ofsmall tensile strains. Once formed, fatigue cracks tend to
propagate initially along slipplanes, although theymay later take a
direction normal tothemaximum applied tensile stress. Fatigue-crack
propagation isordinarily transgranular.
Animportant structural feature which appears tobeunique tofatigue
deformation istheformation onthesurface ofridges andgrooves called
slip-band extrusions andslip-band intrusions JExtremely careful metal-
lography ontapered sections through thesurface ofthespecimen has
shown that fatigue cracks initiate atintrusions and extrusions.'* There-
fore, these structural features aretheorigin ofthepersistent slipbands,
orfissures, discussed intheprevious paragraph. Thestudy ofslip-band
intrusions andextrusions hasbeenundertaken toorecently touncover
allthefactors responsible fortheir formation. However, itappears that
intrusions andextrusions areproduced atlocal softspots inthecrystal,
and thissuggests that cross slip isneeded fortheir formation. This

306 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 12
hypothesis isborne outbythefactthat fatigue failure isdifficult topro-
duce incertain ionic crystals which donoteasily undergo cross slipandby
thefactthat itisnotpossible toproduce fatigue failure inzinc crystals,
which areoriented todeform only ineasy glide.
Inconsidering thestructural changes produced byfatigue, itisadvisa-
bletodifferentiate between tests conducted athigh stresses orstrain
amplitudes, where failure occurs inlessthanabout 10^cycles ofstress,
and tests carried outatlow stresses, where failure occurs inmore than
10^cycles. Structural features produced inthehigh-stress region ofthe
S-Ncurve bear astrong resemblance tothose produced byunidirec-
tional deformation. Anannealed metal usually undergoes moderate
strain hardening with increasing cycles inthehigh-stress region. Coarse
slipbands areformed, andthere isappreciable asterism intheX-ray
diffraction pattern. However, inthelow-stress region sliplines arevery
fineandaredif&cult todistinguish byordinary metallographic techniques.
There isessentially nostrain hardening ordistortion intheX-ray diffrac-
tionpattern. Forcopper specimens tested inthehigh-stress region, the
stored energy isreleased over afairly narrow temperature range during
annealing. This represents energy release due toboth recovery and
recrystallization, just aswould beexpected forametal plastically
deformed intension. When thecopper isfatigued inthelow-stress
region, thestored energy isreleased over awide range oftemperature,
aswould occur ifonlyrecovery took place.^
Astudy ofthedislocation structure inthin films ofaluminum^ has
shown that forhigh fatigue stresses dislocation networks areformed simi-
lartothose formed onunidirectional loading. Atlowfatigue stresses
themetal contains ahigh density ofdislocation loops similar tothose
found inquenched specimens. This isagood indication that largenum-
bers ofpoint defects areproduced during fatigue.
There areanumber ofother indications that cyclic deformation results
inahigher concentration ofvacancies than coldworking byunidirec-
tional deformation. The difference inthe release ofstored energy
between fatigued andcold-worked copper isinlinewithwhatwould be
expected from alarge concentration ofpoint defects. The factthat
initially cold-worked copper becomes softer asaresult offatigue^ canbe
explained bythegeneration ofpoint defects which allow themetal partly
torecover bypermitting dislocations toclimb out ofthe slipplane.
Age-hardening aluminum alloys intheprecipitation-hardened condition
canbeoveraged byfatigue deformation atroom temperature. This sug-

gests thatvacancies produced byfatigue areavailable toaccomplish the
diffusion required fortheoveraging process.^ Moreover, thefatigue
strength increases markedly ongoing from20to—190°C, where vacancy
movement isnegligible. However, thefactthat fatigue fracture canbe
produced at4°Kindicates thatatemperature-activated process such as
thediffusion ofvacancies isnotessential forfatigue failure.-
Theprocess oftheformation ofafatigue crack isoften divided into
three stages.' Theprimary stage occurs only inmetals where theapplied
stress level isabove theinitial static yield stress. Widespread bulk defor-
mation occurs until themetal strain hardens tothepoint where itcan
withstand theapplied stress. Depending upon thestress, the firststage
willlastfor10^to10*cycles. Thesecond stage comprises themajor part
ofthefatigue lifeofaspecimen. Itextends from theinitial widespread
strain hardening totheformation ofavisible crack. During thesecond
stage offatigue thecrack isinitiated. The third stage offatigue con-
sists ofthepropagation ofthecrack toasizelargeenough tocause failure.
There isconsiderable evidence that afatigue crack isformed before
about 10percent ofthetotal lifeofthespecimen haselapsed, although
thecrack cannot bereadily detected, except byrepeated electropolishing,
untilmany cycles later. Theprincipal evidence for this'*'^ isthatanneal-
ingafter only asmall fraction oftheexpected total fatigue lifedoesnot
significantly increase thefatigue life. Ithasbeen concluded that the
damage produced bythissmallnumber ofcycles must beinthenature
ofacrack.
12-6. Theories ofFatigue
Itisperhaps unnecessary tostate thatnomechanism ortheory has
been proposed which adequately explains thephenomenon offatigue.
Foronething, itisunlikely thatourknowledge ofthestructural changes
produced byfatigue isatallcomplete. Many ofthetheories that exist
havebeen qualitative andbase their acceptance mainly onthefactthat
theanalysis yields astress-log A''relationship similar totheobserved
S-Ncurve. However, thismaynotnecessarily beasatisfactory criterion,
formany assumed mechanisms canlead toaprediction ofthegeneral
shape ofthefatigue curve.

Orowan's Theory
Orowan's theory offatigue^ wasoneoftheearUest generally accepted
explanations forthefatigue process. Thistheory leads totheprediction
ofthegeneral shape oftheS-N curve, but itdoesnotdepend onany
specific deformation mechanism other than theconcept thatfatigue defor-
mation isheterogeneous. Themetal isconsidered tocontain small, weak
regions, whichmaybeareas offavorable orientation forsliporareas of
high stress concentration duetometallurgical notches such asinclusions.
Itwasassumed thatthese small regions could betreated asplastic regions
inanelastic matrix. Orowan showed that forrepeated cycles ofconstant
stress amplitude theplastic regions willexperience anincrease instress
andadecrease instrain astheresult ofprogressive localized strain harden-
ing.Hefurther showed thatthetotal plastic strain (sum ofpositive and
negative strains) converges toward afinite value asthenumber ofcycles
increases toward infinity. This limiting value oftotal plastic strain
increases withanincrease inthestress applied tothespecimen. The
existence ofafatigue limit hinges upon thefactthatbelow acertain
stress thetotal plastic strain cannot reach thecritical value required for
fracture. However, ifthestress issuch thatthetotal plastic strain in
theweak region exceeds thecritical value, acrack isformed. Thecrack
creates astress concentration, and thisforms anew localized plastic
region inwhich theprocess isrepeated. This process isrepeated over
andover until thecrack becomes largeenough sothatfracture occurs on
theapplication ofthefulltensile stress ofthecycle. Theessence ofthis
theory isthat localized strain hardening usesuptheplasticity ofthe
metal sothat fracture takes place.
Wood^s Concept ofFatigue
W.A.Wood,^ whohasmademany basic contributions totheunder-
standing ofthemechanism offatigue, hasevolved aconcept offatigue
failure which doesnotrequire localized strain hardening forfatigue defor-
mation tooccur. Heinterprets microscopic observations ofslipproduced
byfatigue asindicating thattheslipbands aretheresult ofasystematic
build-up offine slipmovements, corresponding tomovements oftheorder
of10~^cmrather than steps of10"^to10~*cm,which areobserved for
static slipbands. Such amechanism isbelieved toallow fortheaccom-
modation ofthelarge total strain (summation ofthemicrostrain ineach
cycle) without causing appreciable strain hardening. Figure 12-6 illus-
trates Wood's concept ofhowcontinued deformation byfine slipmight
lead toafatigue crack. The figures illustrate schematically the fine

tour atthemetal surface similar tothatshown inFig. 12-6a. Incon-
trast, theback-and-forth fine slipmovements offatigue could build up

situation might wellbethestart ofafatigue crack. Thismechanism
fortheinitiation ofafatigue crack isinagreement wdth thefacts that
fatigue cracks start atsurfaces andthatcracks havebeenfound toinitiate
atslip-band intrusions andextrusions.
Dislocation Models forFatigue
Thegrowing awareness oftheroleplayed bysubtle changes insurface
topography ininitiating fatigue cracks hasledtoseveral dislocation
models forthegeneration ofslip-band intrusions andextrusions. Cottrell
andHulP have suggested amodel involving theinteraction ofedge dis-
locations ontwo slipsystems, while Mott^ hassuggested oneinvolving
thecross slipofscrew dislocations. Fatigue experiments onionic crys-
tals^tend tosupport theMottmechanism andtodisprove theCottrell-
Hull model.
Theory oftheFatigue Limit
One ofthepuzzling questions infatigue iswhy certain metals exhibit
anS-Ncurve with awell-defined fatigue limit, while other metals donot
have afatigue limit. Theanswer tothisquestion appears tohavebeen

givenbyRall}^ andSinclair/ whonoted thatmetals which undergo strain
aging have anS-Ncurve with asharp kneeandawell-defined fatigue
limit. Their testswithmild steelshowed that asthetotal carbon and
nitrogen content wasdecreased, sothat thetendency forstrain aging
decreased, theS-Ncurve flattened outandtheknee occurred atalarger
number ofcycles than ifthecarbon content were higher. Similar results
werefound byLipsitt andHome." They proposed thatthefatigue limit
represents thestress atwhich abalance occurs between fatigue damage
andlocalized strengthening duetostrain aging. Thecorrelation isfairly
goodbetween materials which show both strain aging andafatigue limit.
Low-carbon steel, titanium, molybdenum, andaluminum-7 percent
magnesium^ alloy aregood examples. Heat-treated steel exhibits a
definite fatigue limit; yet itdoesnotordinarily show strain aging inthe
tension test. However, onlyvery localized strain aging isrequired to
affect fatigue properties, and itisquite likely that thefatigue test is
more sensitive tostrain aging than thetension test.
12-7. Effect ofStress Concentration onFatigue
Fatigue strength isseriously reduced bytheintroduction ofastress
raiser such asanotch orhole. Since actual machine elements invariably
contain stress raisers like fillets, keyways, screw threads, press fits,and
holes, itisnotsurprising tofindthat fatigue cracks instructural parts
usually start atsuch geometrical irregularities. One ofthebestways of
minimizing fatigue failure isbythereduction ofavoidable stress raisers
through careful design^ andtheprevention ofaccidental stress raisers by
careful machining andfabrication. While thissection isconcerned with
stress concentrations resulting from geometrical discontinuities, stress
concentration canalso arisefrom surface roughness andmetallurgical
stress raisers such asporosity, inclusions, local overheating ingrinding,
anddecarburization. These factors willbeconsidered inother sections
ofthischapter.
The effect ofstress raisers onfatigue isgenerally studied bytesting
specimens containing anotch, usually aVnotch oracircular notch. It
hasbeenshown inChap. 7that thepresence ofanotch inaspecimen

under uniaxial load introduces three effects: (1)there isanincrease or
concentration ofstress attheroot ofthenotch; (2)astress gradient is
setupfrom theroot ofthenotch intoward thecenter ofthespecimen;
(3)atriaxial state ofstress isproduced.
The ratio ofthemaximum stress tothenominal stress isthetheoretical
stress-concentration factor Ki.Aswasdiscussed inSec. 2-13, values of
Ktcanbecomputed from thetheory ofelasticity forsimple geometries
andcanbedetermined from photoelastic measurements formore com-
plicated situations. Most oftheavailable dataonstress-concentration
factors havebeen collected byPeterson.^Itisoften desirable toinclude
theeffect ofthebiaxial state ofstress attheroot ofanotch inthevalue
ofthestress-concentration factor. The distortion-energy criterion of
yielding forbiaxial stress canbeexpressed by
a,=(7i(l-C+C2)^^ (12-5)
whereC=crz/aiand ao=0. Ifwedivide both sides ofEq. (12-5) by
thenominal stress, wegettheexpression
Kt'=Kt{l-C+Cy^ (12-6)
where Kt'isthestress concentration factor including bothcombined stress
and stress concentration.
The effect ofnotches onfatigue strength isdetermined bycomparing
theS-N curves ofnotched andunnotched specimens. Thedata for
notched specimens areusually plotted interms ofnominal stress based
onthenetsection ofthespecimen. The effectiveness ofthenotch in
decreasing thefatigue limit isexpressed bythefatigue-strength reduction
factor, orfatigue-notch factor, Kf. This factor issimply theratio ofthe
fatigue limit ofunnotched specimens tothefatigue limit ofnotched speci-
mens. Formaterials which donotexhibit afatigue limit thefatigue-
notch factor isbased onthefatigue strength ataspecified number of
cycles. Values ofKfhave beenfound tovary with (1)severity ofthe
notch, (2)thetype ofnotch, (3)thematerial, (4)thetype ofloading, and
(5)thestress level. Thevalues ofKfpublished intheliterature are
subject toconsiderable scatter andshould becarefully examined fortheir
limitations and restrictions. However, twogeneral trends areusually
observed fortest conditions ofcompletely reversed loading. First,
Kf isusually lessthan Kt,and, second, theratio ofKf/Kt decreases
asKtincreases. Thus, verysharp notches (high Kt)have lesseffect on
fatigue strength thanwould beexpected from their high value ofKt.
This isinagreement with observations that fatigue cracks canexist ina

effect ofgrain sizeonnotch-sensitivity index. Fine grain sizeresults in
ahigher qthan coarse grain size.
Several hypotheses havebeenmade toexplain thevariation ofnotch
sensitivity withnotch radius, section size,andgrain size. Onehypothe-
sisassumes that failure isdetermined bythevolume ofmaterial that is
stressed towithin asmall percentage, say,5percent, ofthemaximum
stress. This involves astatistical argument thattheprobability offind-
ingaflaw orcritical crack nucleus increases with thevolume ofhighly
stressed material. Another viewpoint isthat thestress gradient across
agrain isthecritical factor. Forafinegrain sizethestress gradient is
low,andthevalue ofqislarge. Geometrically similar notches willnot
produce thesame stress gradient across thegrains ifthegrain size is
equal indifferent-diameter specimens. Thespecimen with thelarger
diameter willhave thelower stress gradient across agrain.
12-8. Size Effect
Animportant practical problem istheprediction ofthefatigue per-
formance oflargemachine members from theresults oflaboratory tests
onsmall specimens. Experience hasshown that inmost cases asize effect
exists; i.e.,thefatigue strength oflargemembers islower than that of
small specimens. Aprecise study ofthis effect isdifficult forseveral
reasons. Itisextremely difficult, ifnotaltogether impossible, toprepare
geometrically similar specimens ofincreasing diameter which have the
same metallurgical structure andresidual stress distribution throughout
thecross section. Theproblems infatigue testing large-sized specimens
areconsiderable, andthere arefewfatigue machines which canaccom-
modate specimens having awide range ofcross sections.
Changing thesizeofafatigue specimen usually results inavariation
intwo factors. First, increasing thediameter increases thevolume or
surface area ofthespecimen. Thechange inamount ofsurface isofsig-
nificance, since fatigue failures usually start atthesurface. Second, for
plain ornotched specimens loaded inbending ortorsion, anincrease in
diameter usually decreases thestress gradient across thediameter and
increases thevolume ofmaterial which ishighly stressed.
Experimental dataonthesize effect infatigue arecontradictory and
notvery complete. For tests inreversed bending and torsion, some
investigators havefound nochange infatigue limit withspecimen diam-
eter, whilemorecommonly itisobserved thatthefatigue limit decreases
with increasing diameter. Formild steel thedecrease inbending fatigue

strength ofthesurface metal, and (3)changes intheresidual stress con-
dition ofthesurface. Inaddition, thesurface issubjected tooxidation
andcorrosion.
Surface Roughness
Since theearly days offatigue investigations, ithasbeen recognized
that different surface finishes produced bydifferent machining procedures
canappreciably affect fatigue performance. Smoothly polished speci-
mens, inwhich thefinescratches (stress raisers) areoriented parallel with
thedirection oftheprincipal tensile stress, give thehighest values in
fatigue tests. Such carefully polished specimens areusually used in

carburizing andnitriding. 'However, since favorable compressive resid-
ualstresses areproduced inthesurface bythese processes, itcannot be
considered that thehigher fatigue properties aredueexclusively tothe
formation ofhigher-strength material onthesurface. Theeffectiveness
ofcarburizing andnitriding inimproving fatigue performance isgreater
forcases where ahigh stress gradient exists, asinbending ortorsion,
than inanaxial fatigue test. Thegreatest percentage increase infatigue
performance isfound when notched fatigue specimens arenitrided. The
amount ofstrengthening depends onthediameter ofthepartandthe
depth ofsurface hardening. Improvements infatigue properties similar
tothose caused bycarburizing andnitriding may alsobeproduced by
flame hardening andinduction hardening. Itisageneral characteristic
offatigue insurface-hardened parts thatthefailure initiates attheinter-
facebetween thehard caseandthesofter case, rather than atthesurface.
Electroplating ofthesurface generally decreases thefatigue limit of
steel. Chromium plating isparticularly difficult toaccomplish without
impairment offatigue properties, while asofter cadmium plating is
believed tohave little effect onfatigue strength. Theparticular plating
conditions used toproduce anelectroplated surface canhaveanappreci-
able effect onthefatigue properties, since large changes intheresidual
stress, adhesion, porosity, andhardness oftheplate canbeproduced.^
Surface Residual Stress
Theformation ofafavorable compressive residual-stress pattern atthe
surface isprobably themost effective method ofincreasing fatigue per-
formance. Thesubject ofresidual stress willbeconsidered ingreater
detail inChap. 15.However, forthepresent discussion, itcanbecon-
sidered that residual stresses arelocked-in stresses which arepresent in
apartwhich isnotsubjected toanexternal force. Only macrostresses,
which actover regions which arelargecompared with thegrain size, are
considered here. They canbemeasured byX-ray methods orbynoting
thechanges indimensions when athinlayer ofmaterial isremoved from
thesurface. Residual stresses arisewhen plastic deformation isnotuni-
form throughout theentire cross section ofthepart being deformed.
Consider ametal specimen where thesurface hasbeen deformed in
tension bybending sothat part ofithasundergone plastic deformation.
When theexternal force isremoved, theregions which havebeen plasti-
callydeformed prevent theadjacent elastic regions fromundergoing com-
plete elastic recovery totheunstrained condition. Thus, theelastically

deformed regions areleftinresidual tension, andtheregions which were
plastically deformed must beinastate ofresidual compression tobalance
thestresses over thecross section ofthespecimen. Ingeneral, fora
situation where part ofthecross section isdeformed plastically while the
restundergoes elastic deformation, theregion which was plastically

ing,while theregion which wasdeformed plastically incompression will
have atensile residual stresswhen theexternal force isremoved. The
maximum value ofresidual stress which canbeproduced isequal tothe
elastic limit ofthemetal.
Formany purposes residual stresses canbeconsidered identical tothe
stresses produced byanexternal force. Thus, theaddition ofacom-
pressive residual stress, which exists atapoint onthesurface, toan
externally applied tensile stress onthat surface decreases thelikelihood
offatigue failure atthat point. Figure 12-9 illustrates this effect. Fig-
ure12-9a shows theelastic-stress distribution inabeam withnoresidual
stress. Atypical residual-stress distribution, such aswould beproduced

Sec. 12-9] Fatigue ofMetals 319
byshotpeening, isshown inFig. 12-96. Note thatthehighcompressive
residual stresses atthesurface must bebalanced bytensile residual
stresses over theinterior ofthecross section. InFig. 12-9c thestress
distribution due tothealgebraic summation oftheexternal bending
stresses andtheresidual stresses isshown. Note that themaximum
tensile stress atthesurface isreduced byanamount equal tothesurface
compressive residual stress. Thepeak tensile stress isdisplaced toa
point intheinterior ofthespecimen. Themagnitude ofthis stress
depends onthegradient ofapplied stress andtheresidual-stress distri-
bution. Thus, subsurface initiation offailure ispossible under these
conditions. Itshould alsobeapparent thattheimprovements infatigue
performance which result from theintroduction ofsurface compressive
residual stress willbegreater when theloading isoneinwhich astress
gradient exists thanwhen nostress gradient ispresent. However, some
improvement inthefatigue performance ofaxial loaded fatigue speci-
mens results from surface compressive residual stresses, presumably
because thesurface issuch apotential source ofweakness.
The chief commercial methods ofintroducing favorable compressive
residual stresses inthesurface arebysurface rolling with contoured
rollers andbyshot peening. Although some changes inthestrength of
themetal duetostrain hardening occur during these processes, itis
believed that theimprovement infatigue performance isduechiefly to
theformation ofsurface compressive residual stress. Surface rolling is
particularly adapted tolarge parts. Itisfrequently used incritical
regions such asthe fillets ofcrankshafts andthebearing surface ofrail-
road axles. Shotpeening consists inprojecting finesteel orcast-iron shot
against thesurface athigh velocity. Itisparticularly adapted tomass-
produced parts offairly small size. Theseverity ofthestress produced
byshotpeening isfrequently controlled bymeasuring theresidual defor-
mation ofshot-peened beams called Almen strips. Theprincipal varia-
blesinthisprocess aretheshotvelocity andthesize,shape, andhardness
oftheshot. Caremust betaken toensure uniform coverage over the
area tobetreated. Frequently anadditional improvement infatigue
properties canbeobtained bycarefully polishing theshot-peened surface
toreduce thesurface roughness. Other methods ofintroducing surface
compressive residual stresses arebymeans ofthermal stresses produced
byquenching steelfrom thetempering temperature andfrom stresses
arising from thevolume changes accompanying themetallurgical changes
resulting from carburizing, nitriding, andinduction hardening.
Itisimportant torecognize thatimprovements infatigue properties
donotautomatically result from theuseofshotpeening orsurface roll-
ing. Itispossible todamage thesurface byexcessive peening orrolling.
Experience andtesting arerequired toestablish theproper conditions

320 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 12
which produce theoptimum residual-stress distribution. Further, cer-
tainmetallurgical processes yield surface tensile residual stresses. Thus,
surface tensile stresses areproduced byquenching deep-hardening steel,
and this stress pattern may persist atlowtempering temperatures.
Grinding ofhardened steel requires particular care toprevent alarge
decrease infatigue properties. Ithasbeenshown ^that either tensile or
compressive surface residual stresses canbeproduced, depending upon
thegrinding conditions. Further, thepolishing^ methods ordinarily used
forpreparing fatigue specimens canresult inappreciable surface residual
stress. Itisquite likely that lack ofcontrol ofthisfactor inspecimen
preparation isresponsible formuch ofthescatter infatigue-test results.
Itisimportant torealize that residual-stress patterns maybemodified
byplastic deformation orbythermal activation. Thus, itispossible for
periods ofoverload orperiods ofincreased temperature toresult insome
relief ofresidual stress. Thedataon"fading" ofresidual stress arevery
meager andnottooreliable. Ingeneral, while thepossibility offading
ofresidual stress during service should berecognized, itdoesnotprohibit
theuseofcompressive residual stress asthemost effective method of
combating fatigue failure.
12-10. Corrosion Fatisue
Thesimultaneous action ofcyclic stress andchemical attack isknown
ascorrosion fatigue.^ Corrosive attack without superimposed stress
often produces pitting ofmetal surfaces. The pitsactasnotches and
produce areduction infatigue strength. However, when corrosive attack
occurs simultaneously with fatigue loading, averypronounced reduction
infatigue properties results which isgreater than thatproduced byprior
corrosion ofthesurface. When corrosion andfatigue occur simultane-
ously, thechemical attack greatly accelerates therate atwhich fatigue
cracks propagate. Materials which show adefinite fatigue limitwhen
tested inairatroom temperature show noindication ofafatigue limit
when thetest iscarried outinacorrosive environment. While ordinary
fatigue tests inairarenotaffected bythespeed oftesting, over arange
fromabout 1,000 to12,000 cycles/min, when tests aremade inacorrosive
environment there isadefinite dependence ontesting speed. Since cor-
rosive attack isatime-dependent phenomenon, thehigher thetesting
speed, thesmaller thedamage duetocorrosion. Corrosion-fatigue tests
maybecarried outintwoways. Intheusualmethod thespecimen is

continuously subjected tothecombined influences ofcorrosion andcyclic
stress until failure occurs. Inthetwo-stage testthecorrosion fatigue
test isinterrupted after acertain period andthedamage which waspro-
duced isevaluated bydetermining theremaining lifeinair. Tests ofthe
lasttypehave helped toestablish themechanism ofcorrosion fatigue.^
Theaction ofthecyclic stress causes localized disruption ofthesurface
oxide filmsothatcorrosion pitscanbeproduced. Many more small pits
occur incorrosion fatigue than incorrosive attack intheabsence ofstress.
The cyclic stress willalsotend toremove ordislodge anycorrosion prod-
uctswhich might otherwise stifle thecorrosion. Thebottoms ofthepits
aremore anodic than therest ofthemetal sothat corrosion proceeds
inward, aidedbythedisruption oftheoxide filmbycyclic strain. Crack-
ingwilloccurwhen thepitbecomes sharp enough toproduce ahigh stress
concentration.
There isevidence toindicate thateven fatigue tests inairatroom
temperature areinfluenced bycorrosion fatigue. Fatigue testsoncopper
showed thatthefatigue strength washigher inapartial vacuum than in
air."^ Separate tests inoxygen andwater vapor showed little decrease
overthefatigue strength invacuum. Itwasconcluded thatwater vapor
acts asacatalyst toreduce thefatigue strength inair,indicating that
therelative humidity maybeavariable toconsider infatigue testing.
Subsequent work with copper^ showed that thefatigue lifewasmuch
longer inoxygen-free nitrogen than inair. Metallographic observation
showed thatthedevelopment ofpersistent slipbands wasslowed down
when testsweremade innitrogen.
Anumber ofmethods areavailable forminimizing corrosion-fatigue
damage. Ingeneral, thechoice ofamaterial forthistype ofservice
should bebased onitscorrosion-resistant properties rather than thecon-
ventional fatigue properties. Thus, stainless steel, bronze, orberyllium
copper would probably givebetter service than heat-treated steel. Pro-
tection ofthemetal from contact with thecorrosive environment by
metallic ornonmetallic coatings issuccessful provided that thecoating
does notbecome ruptured from thecyclic strain. Zincandcadmium
coatings onsteelandaluminum coatings onAlclad aluminum alloys are
successful formany corrosion-fatigue applications, even though these
coatings may cause areduction infatigue strength when tests arecon-
ducted inair.Theformation ofsurface compressive residual stresses
tends tokeep surface notches from opening upandgiving ready access
tothecorrosive medium. Nitriding isparticularly effective incombating
corrosion fatigue, andshotpeening hasbeenusedwith success under cer-

tain conditions. Inclosed systems itispossible toreduce thecorrosive
attack bytheaddition ofacorrosion inhibitor. Finally, theelimination
ofstress concentrators bycareful design isveryimportant when corrosion
fatigue must beconsidered.
Fretting
Fretting isthesurface damage which results when twosurfaces incon-
tactexperience slight periodic relative motion. Thephenomenon ismore
related towearthan tocorrosion fatigue. However, itdiffers fromwear
bythefacts thattherelative velocity ofthetwosurfaces ismuch lower
than isusually encountered inwearandthat since thetwosurfaces are
never brought outofcontact there isnochance forthecorrosion products
toberemoved. Fretting isfrequently found onthesurface ofashaft
with apress-fitted hub orbearing. Surface pitting anddeterioration
occur, usually accompanied byanoxide debris (reddish forsteeland
black foraluminum). Fatigue cracks often start inthedamaged area,
although theymaybeobscured from observation bythesurface debris.
Fretting iscaused byacombination ofmechanical andchemical effects.
Metal isremoved from thesurface either byagrinding action orbythe
alternate welding andtearing away ofthehigh spots. Theremoved
particles become oxidized andformanabrasive powder which continues
thedestructive process. Oxidation ofthemetal surface occurs andthe
oxide film isdestroyed bytherelative motion ofthesurfaces. Although
oxidation isnotessential tofretting, asisdemonstrated byrelative motion
between twononoxidizing gold surfaces, when conditions aresuch that
oxidation canoccur fretting damage ismany times more severe.
There arenocompletely satisfactory methods ofpreventing fretting.
Ifallrelative motion isprevented, then fretting willnotoccur. Increas-
ingtheforcenormal tothesurfaces mayaccomplish this,butthedamage
increases with thenormal forceuptothepoint where relative motion is
stopped. Ifrelative motion cannot becompletely eliminated, thenreduc-
tion ofthecoefficient offriction between themating partsmaybebene-
ficial. Solid lubricants such asMoS aremost successful, since thechief
problem ismaintaining alubricating film foralong period oftime.
Increasing thewear resistance ofthesurfaces soastoreduce surface
welding isanother approach. Exclusion oftheatmosphere from the
twosurfaces willreduce fretting, but this isfrequently difficult todo
with ahigh degree ofeffectiveness. Several excellent reviews ofthis
subject have been published.^'

Many machine parts must withstand complex loadings with both

equation ofthefailure criterion, justastheyield stress intension canbe

ingunder acomplex state ofstress. Although thedataoncombined-
stress fatigue failure arefewer and lessreliable than forstatic yielding,

distortion-energy criterion provides thebest over-all fit.For brittle
materials amaximum principal stress theory provides thebest criterion
offailure.

Theconventional fatigue testsubjects aspecimen toafixed stress
amplitude until thespecimen fails. Testsmaybemade atanumber of
different values ofstress todetermine theS-N curve, buteachtime the
maximum stress isheldconstant until thetest iscompleted. However,
there aremany practical applications where thecyclic stress does not
remain constant, butinstead there areperiods when thestress iseither
above orbelow some average design stress level. Further, inother appli-
cations complex loading conditions,
such asareillustrated inFig. 12-2c,
areencountered. Forthese condi-
tions itisdifficult toarrive atan
average stress level, andtheload-
ingcannot beassumed tovary
sinusoidally. Special fatigue tests
which apply arandom loadhave
been developed forthese cases.^
Overstressing istheprocess of
testing avirgin specimen forsome
number ofcycles lessthan that re-
quired forfailure, atastress above
thefatigue limit, andthen subse-
quently running thespecimen to
failure atanother stress. The initial stress towhich thespecimen issub-
jected iscalled theprestress, while thefinal stress isthetest stress. The
ratio ofthenumber ofcycles ofoverstress attheprestress tothemean vir-
ginfatigue lifeatthissame stress iscalled thecycle ratio. Thedamage
produced byagiven cycle ratio ofoverstress isfrequently evaluated bythe
reduction infatigue lifeatthetest stress. Thus, referring toFig. 12-13,
foracycle ratio attheprestress ofAB/ACthedamage attheteststress
isEF/DF. EFrepresents theamount which thevirgin fatigue lifeat

given cycle ratio ataprestress lower than thetest stress, thereduction in
lifeatthetest stress willusually bealower percentage than thecycle

between prestress and test stress, themore nearly thedamage atthetest

Another way ofmeasuring thedamage duetooverstressing istosub-
jectanumber ofspecimens toacertain cycle ratio attheprestress and
then determine thefatigue Hmit ofthedamaged specimens. Bennett^
hasshown that increasing thecycle ratio attheprestress produces a
greater decrease inthefatigue limit ofdamaged specimens, while similar
experiments^ which employed astatistical determination ofthefatigue
limitshowed amuch greater reduction inthefatigue limit duetothe
overstressing. Inlinewith this point, itisimportant tonote that,
because ofthestatistical nature offatigue, itisvery difficult toreach
reliable conclusions byoverstressing tests, unless statistical methods are
used.
Ifaspecimen istested below thefatigue limit, sothat itremains
unbroken after alongnumber ofcycles, and ifthen itistested ata
higher stress, thespecimen issaidtohave been under stressed. Under-
stressing frequently results ineither anincrease inthefatigue limit or
anincrease inthenumber ofcycles ofstress tofracture overwhatwould
beexpected forvirgin specimens. Ithasfrequently been considered
that theimprovements infatigue properties duetounderstressing are
duetolocalized strain hardening atsites ofpossible crack initiation. A
different interpretation oftheunderstressing effect hasresulted from
experiments onthestatistical determination ofthefatigue limit.^Speci-
mens which didnot failduring thedetermination ofthefatigue limit
showed greater thannormal fatigue liveswhen retested atahigher stress.
Bymeans ofstatistical analysis itwaspossible toshow thattheobserved
lives atthehigher stress were tobeexpected owing totheelimination of
theweaker specimens during theprior testing below thefatigue limit.
Thus, itwasconcluded thatunderstressing wasatleast partly duetoa
statistical selectivity effect.
Ifaspecimen istested without failure foralargenumber ofcycles
below thefatigue limitandthestress isincreased insmall increments
after allowing alargenumber ofcycles tooccur ateach stress level, itis
found that theresulting fatigue limitmay beasmuch as50percent
greater than theinitial fatigue limit. Thisprocedure isknown ascoaxing.
Anextensive investigation ofcoaxing"* showed adirect correlation between
astrong coaxing effect andtheability forthematerial toundergo strain
aging. Thus, mild steelandingot ironshow astrong coaxing effect, while

12-14. EFfect ofMetallursical Variables onFatigue Properties
Thefatigue properties ofmetals appear tobequite structure-sensitive.
However, atthepresent time there areonlyalimited number ofways in
which thefatigue properties canbeimproved bymetallurgical means.
Byfarthegreatest improvements infatigue performance result from
design changes which reduce stress concentrations andfrom the intelli-
gent useofbeneficial compressive residual stress, rather thanfrom a
change inmaterial. Nevertheless, there arecertain metallurgical fac-
torswhich must beconsidered toensure thebest fatigue performance
from aparticular metal oralloy. Fatigue tests designed tomeasure the
effect ofsome metallurgical variable, such asspecial heat treatments, on
fatigue performance areusually made withsmooth, polished specimens
under completely reversed stress conditions. Itisusually assumed that
anychanges infatigue properties duetometallurgical factors willalso
occur toabout thesame extent under more complex fatigue conditions,
aswithnotched specimens under combined stresses. That this isnot
always thecase isshown bythenotch-sensitivity results discussed
previously.
Fatigue properties arefrequently correlated with tensile properties.
Ingeneral, thefatigue limit ofcastandwrought steels isapproximately
50percent oftheultimate tensile strength. The ratio ofthefatigue
limit (orthefatigue strength at10^cycles) tothetensile strength iscalled
thefatigue ratio. Several nonferrous metals such asnickel, copper, and
magnesium have afatigue ratio ofabout 0.35. While theuseofcorre-
lations ofthistype isconvenient, itshould beclearly understood that
these constant factors between fatigue limitandtensile strength areonly
approximations andhold only fortherestricted condition ofsmooth,
polished specimens which have been tested under zeromean stress at
room temperature. Fornotched fatigue specimens thefatigue ratio for
steel willbearound 0.20 to0.30.
Several parallels canbedrawn between theeffect ofcertain metallurgi-
calvariables onfatigue properties andtheeffect ofthesesame variables
ontensile properties. The effect ofsolid-solution alloying additions on
thefatigue properties ofiron^andaluminum^ parallels nearly exactly
their effect onthetensile properties. Thefatigue strength ofnonferrous
metals^ andannealed steel increases with decreasing grain size. Grain

hmit ofaeutectoid steel increased with decreasing isothermal-reaction
temperature inthesame fashion asdidtheyield strength andthetensile
strength. However, thegreater structure sensitivity offatigue proper-
ties,compared with tensile properties, isshown intestscomparing the

pearlite andtospheroidite ofthesame tensile strength. ^Even though
thesteel inthetwostructural conditions hadthesame tensile strength,
thepearlitic structure resulted inasignificantly lower fatigue limitdueto
thehigher notch effects ofthecarbide lamellae inpearlite.
Ingeneral, quenched andtempered microstructures result intheopti-
mum fatigue properties inheat-treated low-alloy steels. However, ata
hardness level above about Re40abainitic structure produced by
austempering results inbetter fatigue properties than aquenched and
tempered structure with thesame hardness.^ Electron micrographs indi-

atiire. The factthat fatigue strength exhibits aproportionately greater
increase than tensile strength withdecreasing temperature hasbeen inter-
preted asanindication thatfatigue failure atroom temperature isassoci-
atedwithvacancy formation andcondensation.
High-temperature Fatigue
Ingeneral, thefatigue strength ofmetals decreases with increasing
temperature above room temperature. Anexception ismild steel, which
shows amaximum infatigue strength at400to600°F. Theexistence of
amaximum inthetensile strength inthistemperature range duetostrain
aging hasbeen discussed previously. Asthetemperature isincreased
wellabove room temperature, creep willbecome important andathigh
temperatures (roughly attemperatures greater than halfthemelting
point) itwillbetheprincipal cause offailure. The transition from
fatigue failure tocreep failure with increasing temperature willresult in
achange inthetype offailure from theusual transcrystalline fatigue
failure totheintercrystalline creep failure. Atanygiven temperature
theamount ofcreep willincrease with increasing mean stress.
Ferrous materials, which ordinarily exhibit asharp fatigue limit in
room-temperature tests, willnolonger have afatigue limitwhen tested
attemperatures above approximately 800°F. Also, fatigue tests athigh
temperature willbedependent onthefrequency ofstress application.
Itiscustomary toreport thetotal time tofailure aswellasthenumber
ofcycles tofailure.
Ingeneral, thehigher thecreep strength ofamaterial, thehigher its
high-temperature fatigue strength. However, themetallurgical treat-
ment which produces thebesthigh-temperature fatigue properties does
notnecessarily result inthebestcreep orstress-rupture properties. This
hasbeenshown byToolin andMocheP inhigh-temperature tests ofa
number ofsuperalloys. Fine grain sizeresults inbetter fatigue proper-
tiesatlower temperatures. Asthetesttemperature isincreased, the
difference infatigue properties between coarse and finegrain material
decreases until athigh temperatures, where creep predominates, coarse
grain material hashigher strength. Ingeneral, wrought alloys show
somewhat superior fatigue resistance, while castings areoften more
resistant tocreep. Procedures which aresuccessful inreducing fatigue
failures atroom temperature may notbeeffective inhigh-temperature
fatigue. Forexample, compressive residual stresses maybeannealed out
before theoperating temperature isreached.
Thermal Fatigue
The stresses which produce fatigue failure athightemperature donot
necessarily need tocome from mechanical sources. Fatigue failure can

beproduced byfluctuating thermal stresses under conditions where no
stresses areproduced bymechanical causes. Thermal stresses result
when thechange indimensions ofamember astheresult ofatemper-
ature change isprevented bysome kind ofconstraint. Forthesimple

Iffailure occurs byoneapplication ofthermal stress, thecondition is
called thermal shock. However, iffailure occurs after repeated appli-
cations ofthermal stress, ofalower magnitude, itiscalled thermal fatigue.^
Conditions forthermal-fatigue failure arefrequently present inhigh-
temperature equipment. Austenitic stainless steel isparticularly sensi-
tivetothisphenomenon because ofitslowthermal conductivity andhigh
thermal expansion. Extensive studies ofthermal fatigue inthismaterial
havebeen reported.^ Thetendency forthermal-fatigue failure appears
related totheparameter a/k/Ea, where o-/isthefatigue strength atthe
mean temperature andkisthethermal conductivity. Ahigh value of
thisparameter indicates good resistance tothermal fatigue. Anexcellent
review oftheentire subject ofhigh-temperature fatigue hasbeenprepared
byAllen andForrest.^

CREEPAND STRESS RUPTURE
13-1. TheHigh-temperature Materials Problem
Inseveral previous chapters ithasbeenmentioned that thestrength
ofmetals decreases with increasing temperature. Since themobility of
atoms increases rapidly with temperature, itcanbeappreciated that
diffusion-controlled processes canhave avery significant effect onhigh-
temperature mechanical properties. High temperature willalsoresult in
greater mobility ofdislocations bythemechanism ofclimb. Theequi-
librium concentration ofvacancies likewise increases with temperature.
New deformation mechanisms maycome intoplay atelevated temper-
atures. Insome metals theslipsystem changes, oradditional slipsys-
tems areintroduced with increasing temperature. Deformation atgrain
boundaries becomes anadded possibility inthehigh-temperature defor-
mation ofmetals. Another important factor toconsider istheeffect of
prolonged exposure atelevated temperature onthemetallurgical stability
ofmetals andalloys. Forexample, cold-worked metals willrecrystallize
andundergo grain coarsening, while age-hardening alloysmayoverage
andlosestrength asthesecond-phase particles coarsen. Another impor-
tantconsideration istheinteraction ofthemetal with itsenvironment at
hightemperature. Catastrophic oxidation andintergranular penetration
ofoxide must beavoided.
Thus, itshould beapparent that thesuccessful use ofmetals at
hightemperatures involves anumber ofproblems. Greatly accelerated
alloy-development programs have produced anumber ofmaterials with
improved high-temperature properties, buttheever-increasing demands
ofmodern technology require materials witheven better high-temper-
ature strength andoxidation resistance. Foralongtime theprincipal
high-temperature applications were associated withsteam power plants,
oilrefineries, andchemical plants. Theoperating temperature inequip-
ment such asboilers, steam turbines, andcracking units seldom exceeded
1000°F. With theintroduction ofthegas-turbine engine, requirements
developed formaterials tooperate incritically stressed parts, liketurbine

buckets, attemperatures around 1500°F. Thedesign ofmore powerful
engines haspushed this limit toaround 1800°F. Rocket engines and
ballistic-missile nosecones present much greater problems, which canbe
metonlybythemost ingenious useoftheavailable high-temperature
materials andthedevelopment ofstillbetter ones. There isnoquestion
that theavailable materials ofconstruction limit rapid advancement in
high-temperature technology.
Animportant characteristic ofhigh-temperature strength isthat it
must always beconsidered with respect tosome time scale. The tensile
properties ofmost engineering metals atroom temperature areindepend-
entoftime, forpractical purposes. Itmakes little difference inthe
results iftheloading rate ofatension test issuch that itrequires 2hror
2min tocomplete the test. Further, inroom-temperature tests the
anelastic behavior ofthematerial isoflittle practical consequence.
However, atelevated temperature thestrength becomes verydependent
onboth strain rateandtime ofexposure. Anumber ofmetals under
these conditions behave inmany respects likeviscoelastic materials. A
metal subjected toaconstant tensile load atanelevated temperature will
creepandundergo atime-dependent increase inlength.
The testswhich areused tomeasure elevated-temperature strength
must beselected onthebasis ofthetime scale oftheservice which the
material must withstand. Thus, anelevated-temperature tension test
canprovide useful information about thehigh-temperature performance
ofashort-lived item, such asarocket engine ormissile nose cone, but it
willgiveonly themostmeager information about thehigh-temperature
performance ofasteam pipeline which isrequired towithstand 100,000 hr
ofelevated-temperature service. Therefore, special tests arerequired to
evaluate theperformance ofmaterials indifferent kinds ofhigh-temper-
ature service. The creej) testmeasures thedimensional changes which
occur from elevated-temperature exposure, while thestress-rupture test
measures theeffect oftemperature onthelong-time load-bearing charac-
teristics. Other testsmay beused tomeasure special properties such
asthermal-shock resistance and stress relaxation. These high-temper-
ature tests willbediscussed inthischapter fromtwopoints ofview.
Theengineering significance oftheinformation obtained from thetests
willbediscussed, andinformation which isleading toabetter under-
standing ofthemechanism ofhigh-temperature deformation willbe
considered.

with time, thenreaches essentially asteady state inwhich thecreep rate

towhich these three stages arereadily distinguishable depends strongly
ontheapplied stress andtemperature.

(13-2). Sometimes transient creep isreferred toas /3flow,andviscous
(steady-state) creep isreferred toaskflow inkeeping withAndrade's
analysis ofthecreep curve. Andrade's equation hasbeen verified for
conditions extending uptoseveral hundred hours, which result intotal
extensions inexcess of1percent. Modifications ofthese equations will
beconsidered inanother section ofthischapter.
Thevarious stages ofthecreep curve shown inFig. 13-1require fur-
ther explanation. Itisgenerally considered inthiscountry that the
creep curve hasthree stages. InBritish terminology theinstantaneous
strain designated byeoinFig. 13-1 isoften called the firststage ofcreep,
sothatwith thisnomenclature thecreep curve isconsidered tohave four
stages. The strain represented by eooccurs practically instantaneously
ontheapplication oftheload. Even though theapplied stress isbelow
theyield stress, not alltheinstantaneous strain iselastic. Most ofthis
strain isinstantly recoverable upon therelease oftheload (elastic), while
part isrecoverable withtime (anelastic), andtherest isnonrecoverable
(plastic). Although theinstantaneous strain isnotreally creep, itis
important because itmay constitute aconsiderable fraction oftheallow-
able total strain inmachine parts. Sometimes theinstantaneous strain

340 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 13
issubtracted from thetotal strain inthecreep specimen togivethestrain
dueonly tocreep. This type ofcreep curve starts attheorigin of
coordinates.
The firststage ofcreep, known asprimary creep, represents aregion of
decreasing creep rate. Primary creep isaperiod ofpredominantly tran-
sient creep inwhich thecreep resistance ofthematerial increases by
virtue ofitsowndeformation. Forlowtemperatures and stresses, asin
thecreep oflead atroom temperature, primary creep isthepredominant
creep process. Thesecond stage ofcreep, known alsoassecondary creep,
isaperiod ofnearly constant creep ratewhich results from abalance
between thecompeting processes
ofstrain hardening andrecovery.
Forthisreason, secondary creep is
usually referred toassteady-state
creep. Theaverage value ofthe
creep rateduring secondary creep
iscalled theminimum creep rate.
Third-stage ortertiary creepmainly
occurs inconstant-load creep tests
athigh stresses athigh tempera-
tures. Thereasons fortheacceler-
atedcreep ratewhich leads torapid
failure arenotwellknown. Itis
unlikely that tertiary creep isdue
solely tonecking ofthespecimen,
sincemany materials failincreep
atstrains which aretoosmall toproduce necking. Tertiary creep ismore
probably theresult ofstructural changes occurring inthemetal. Evi-
dence hasbeenfound forvoidformation andextensive crack formation
during thisstage.
Figure 13-3shows theeffect ofapplied stress onthecreep curve at
constant temperature. Itisapparent thatacreep curve with three well-
defined stages willbefound foronly certain combinations ofstress and
temperature. Asimilar family ofcurves isobtained forcreep atcon-
stant stress fordifferent temperatures. Thehigher thetemperature, the
greater t-hecreep rate. Thebasic difference forthiscasewould bethat
allthecurves would originate from thesame point onthestrain axis.
Theminimum creep rate isthemost important design parameter
derived from thecreep curve. Two standards ofthisparameter are
commonly used inthiscountry, (1)thestress toproduce acreep rate of
0.0001 percent/hr or1percent/10,000 hr,or(2)thestress foracreep
rate of0.00001 percent/hr or1percent/ 100,000 hr(about 11^years).
The firstcriterion ismore typical oftherequirements forjet-engine alloys,
while thelastcriterion isused forsteam turbines andsimilar equipment.Time, hr

Alog-log plot ofstress vs.minimum creep ratefrequently results ina
straight line. This type ofplot isvery useful fordesign purposes, and
itsusewillbediscussed more fully inalater part ofthischapter.
13-3. TheStress-rupture Test
Thestress-rupture test isbasically similar tothecreep testexcept that
thetest isalways carried outtothefailure ofthematerial. Higher loads
areusedwith thestress-rupture testthan inacreep test,andtherefore
thecreep rates arehigher. Ordinarily thecreep test iscarried outat
relatively lowstresses soastoavoid tertiary creep. Emphasis inthe
creep test isonprecision determination ofstrain, particularly astothe
determination oftheminimum creep rate. Creep tests arefrequently
conducted forperiods of2,000 hrandoften to10,000 hr. Inthecreep
testthetotal strain isoften lessthan 0.5percent, while inthestress-
rupture testthetotal strainmaybearound 50percent. Thus, simpler
strain-measuring devices, such asdialgages, canbeused. Stress-rupture
equipment issimpler tobuild, maintain, andoperate than creep-testing
equipment, andtherefore itlends itselfmore readily tomultiple testing
units. The higher stresses and
creep rates ofthestress-rupture test
cause structural changes tooccur in
metals atshorter times thanwould
beobserved ordinarily inthecreep
test,and therefore stress-rupture
tests canusually beterminated in
1,000 hr.These factors have con-
tributed totheincreased useofthe
stress-rupture test. Itispartic-
ularly well suited todetermin-
ingtherelative high-temperature
strength ofnewalloys forjet-engine
applications. Further, forappli-
cations where creep deformation canbetolerated butfracture must be
prevented, ithasdirect application indesign.
Thebasic information obtained from thestress-rupture test isthetime
tocause failure atagiven nominal stress foraconstant temperature.

mum creep rate. The stress isplotted against therupture timeona

each testtemperature. Changes intheslope ofthestress-rupture line

tization, orsigma-phase formation. Itisimportant toknow about the
existence ofsuch instabilities, since serious errors inextrapolation ofthe
data tolonger times canresult ifthey arenotdetected.
13-4.Deformation atElevated Temperature
Theprincipal deformation processes atelevated temperature are slip,
subgrain formation, and grain-boundary sHding. High-temperature
deformation ischaracterized byextreme inhomogeneity. Measure-
ments oflocal creep elongation^ atvarious locations inacreep specimen
haveshown that thelocal strain undergoes many periodic changes with
time that arenotrecorded inthechanges instrain ofthetotal gage
length ofthespecimen. Inlarge-grained specimens, local regions may
undergo lattice rotations which produce areas ofmisorientation.
Anumber ofsecondary deformation processes have been observed in
metals atelevated temperature. These include multiple slip, thefor-
mation ofextremely coarse slipbands, kink bands, foldformation at
grain boundaries, andgrain-boundary migration. Many ofthedefor-
mation studies atelevated temperature havebeenmade with large-grain-
sizesheet specimens ofaluminum. (Aluminum isfavored forthistype
ofstudy because itsthinoxide skineliminates problems from oxidation.)
Studies have alsobeenmade ofcreep deformation iniron,magnesium,
andlead. Itisimportant toremember that allthestudies ofhigh-tem-
perature deformation have beenmade under conditions which givea
creep rate ofseveral percent in100or1,000 hr,while formany engi-
neering applications acreep rate oflessthan 1percent in100,000 hris
required. Because thedeformation processes which occur atelevated
temperature depend ontherate ofstrain aswellasthetemperature, itis
notalways possible toextrapolate theresults obtained forhigh strain-
rateconditions toconditions ofgreater practical interest. Much ofthe
work ondeformation processes during creep hasbeenreviewed bySuUy^
andGrant andChaudhuri.^

inthe(1210) directions above 570°F, andthere isevidence ofnonbasal
high-temperature slipinmagnesium.^The slipbands produced athigh
temperature donotgenerally resemble thestraight slip lineswhich are
usually found afterroom-temperature deformation. Although high-tem-
perature slipmay start initially asfairly uniformly spaced slipbands, as
deformation proceeds there isatendency forfurther shear toberestricted
toafewoftheslipbands. Thetendency forcross slipandtheformation
ofdeformation bands increases withtemperature. Fine slip lines, which
are difficult toresolve with theoptical microscope, have been found
between thecoarse slipbands increep specimens ofaluminum.^ These
represent thetraces ofslipplanes onwhich onlyvery small amounts of
shear have occurred. The significance offine sliptocreep deformation
willbediscussed later.
Inoneofthe firstinvestigations ofcreep-deformation processes, Hanson
andWheeler^ established thattheslip-band spacing increases with either
anincrease intemperature oradecrease instress. Subsequent work
onaluminum and itsalloys^' ^showed that theslip-band spacing was
inversely proportional totheapplied stress butindependent oftemper-
ature. These observations may beinterpreted inthefollowing way:
Ifaluminum withacertain initial grain size istested atacertain stress,
there willbeacertain characteristic slip-band spacing. Ifthegrain size
issmaller than theslip-band spacing, the slipbands willnotbevisible
inthespecimen after deformation. Deformation ofthegrains willoccur
byshear along thegrain boundaries andbythebreakup ofthegrains into
"cells," orsubgrains.^ Deformation athightemperatures and/or low
strain rates areconditions forwhich itisdifficult todetect sliplinesbut
forwhich there isabundant evidence ofgrain-boundary deformation.
This condition hasoften been called "slipless flow."
Complex deformation processes occur inthevicinity ofthegrain
boundaries. While grain boundaries restrict deformation athightem-
perature toalesser extent than atroom temperature, they stillexert a
restraining influence ondeformation.
Suhgrain Formation
Creep deformation isquite inhomogeneous, sothat there aremany
opportunities forlattice bending tooccur. Kink bands, deformation
bands, and local bending near grain boundaries areknown tooccur.

Polygoiiization cantake place concurrently with lattice bending because
dislocation climb canoccur readily athightemperature (seeSec. 6-10).
Theformation ofcells, orsubgrains, ascreep progresses hasbeenobserved
bymeans ofXraysandmetallographic techniques. The sizeofthesub-
grains depends onthestress andthetemperature. Large subgrains, or
cells, areproduced byhightemperature andalowstress orcreep rate.
Thedecreasing creep ratefound during primary creep istheresult ofthe
formation ofmoreandmore subgrains ascreep continues. Theincreased
number oflow-angle boundaries provides barriers todislocation move-
mentandresults inadecrease increep strain.
Grain-boundary Deformation
Ithasalready beenshown inSec.8-5thatthegrain-boundary relax-
ation which ismeasured byinternal friction atelevated temperature
indicates thatthegrain boundaries have acertain viscous behavior under
these conditions. Therefore, itisnotsurprising thatthegrain boundaries
behave inamanner toindicate considerable mobility when creep ispro-
duced athightemperature. Themain grain-boundary processes which
areobserved inhigh-temperature creep aregrain-boundary sliding, grain-
boundary migration, andfoldformation.
Grain-boundary sliding isashear process which occurs inthedirection
ofthegrain boundary. Itispromoted byincreasing thetemperature
and/or decreasing thestrain rate. The question whether thesliding
occurs along thegrainboundary^asabulkmovement ofthetwograins
orinasoftened area ineach grain adjacent tothegrain boundary ^has
notbeen answered. Grain-boundary shearing occurs discontinuously in
time, andtheamount ofshear displacement isnotuniform along the
grain boundary. Although theexactmechanism isnotknown, itisclear
thatgrain-boundary sliding isnotduetosimple viscous sliding ofone
grain past another because itispreceded byappreciable amounts of
plastic flow inadjacent crystals.
Grain-boundary migration isamotion ofthegrain boundary ina
direction which isinclined tothegrain boundary. Itmaybeconsidered
tobestress-induced grain growth. Grain-boundary migration isacreep
recovery process which isimportant because itallows thedistorted mate-
rialadjacent tothegrainboundary toundergo further deformation. The
wavy grain boundaries which arefrequently observed during high-tem-
perature creep arearesult ofinhomogeneous grain-boundary deformation
andgrain-boundary migration.
Forgrain-boundary deformation tooccur without producing cracks
atthegrain boundaries, itisnecessary toachieve continuity ofstrain

along thegrain boundary. Acommon method ofaccommodating grain-
boundary strain athightemperature isbytheformation offolds atthe
endofagrain boundary.^Figure 13-5shows asketch ofafold.
The relative importance ofslipandgrain-boundary displacement to
thetotal creep deformation hasbeen investigated byMcLean- foralumi-
num at200°C. Atthis relatively lowtem-
perature hehasshown that only asmall
fraction ofthetotal deformation isdueto
grain-boundary displacement, about halfthe
total deformation isdue toslipwhich is
readily attributed tocoarse slipbands, while
theremainder ofthetotal deformation can-
notbeattributed toanymicroscopic defor-
mation mechanism. McLean attributes this
"missing creep" todeformation byfine slip,
which isvery difficult todetect with the I
microscope. Itisbelieved thatdeformation
byfine slipcanexplain theobservationsFig.13-5. Foldformation ata

occurs without slip (slipless flow). Greater
contribution tothetotal deformation from grain-boundary displacement
would beexpected athigher temperatures andlower stresses.
13-5. Fracture atElevated Temperature
Ithasbeenknown since theearlywork ofRosenhain andEwen' that
metals undergo atransition from transgranular fracture tointergranular
fracture asthetemperature isincreased. When transgranular fracture
occurs, the slipplanes areweaker than thegrain boundaries, while for
intergranular fracture thegrain boundary istheweaker component.
Jeffries'' introduced theconcept oftheequicohesive temperature (EOT),
which wasdefined asthattemperature atwhich thegrains andgrain
boundaries have equal strength (Fig. 13-6a). Like therecrystallization
temperature, theECT isnotafixed one. Inaddition totheeffect of
stress andtemperature ontheECT, thestrain ratehasanimportant
influence. Figure 13-66 shows thatdecreasing thestrain ratelowers the
ECT and therefore increases thetendency forintergranular fracture.
The effect ofstrain rateonthestrength-temperature relationship is
believed tobemuch larger forthegrain-boundary strength than for

reasonable models forgrain-boundary fracture havebeen suggested, none
arecapable ofpredicting allthedetails ofgrain-boundary fracture.
Two types ofintergranular fracture have been observed under creep
conditions. Under conditions where grain-boundary sliding canoccur,
cracks may beinitiated attriple points where three grain boundaries
meetonaplane ofpolish. Thistype ofgrain-boundary failure ispreva-
lentforhigh stresses, where thetotal life isfairly short. Several methods
bywhich cracks form' astheresult ofgrain-boundary sliding areshown
schematically inFig. 13-7. Zener- hasshown that large tensile stresses
should bedeveloped atatriple point duetoshear stresses acting along
thegrain boundaries. When grain-boundary migration andfoldforma-
tioncanoccur, thetendency forgrain-boundary fracture isdiminished.
Grain-boundary migration displaces thestrained grain boundary toa
newunstrained region ofthecrystal, while theformation offolds per-
mits the relief ofstress concentration atgrain corners byplastic defor-
mation within thegrains.
Thesecond type ofintergranular fracture ischaracterized bythe
formation ofvoids atgrain boundaries, particularly those which are
perpendicular tothetensile stress. Thevoids grow andcoalesce into
grain-boundary cracks. This type offracture ismost prevalent when
low stresses result infailure inrelatively long times. Atleasttwo
mechanisms have been suggested forthistype offracture. Onemecha-
nism isbased ontheideathatthevoids areformed bythecondensation
ofvacancies andgrowbythediffusion ofvacancies. Ballufh andSeigle*
haveadvanced atheory forthegrowth ofvoids based ontheideas used
toexplain thesintering ofmetals. Ontheother hand, there areexperi-
ments" which show thatgrain-boundary voids arenotformed unless there
isgrain-boundary sliding. Itisuncertain, atpresent, whether voids are
initiated atgrain boundaries byaprocess ofvacancy condensation oras
theresult oflocalized plastic yielding.
13-6. Theories ofLow-temperature Creep
Creep ispossible onlybecause obstacles todeformation canbeovercome
bythecombined action ofthermal fluctuations and stress. Diffusion-
controlled processes areimportant chiefly attemperatures greater than
about one-half themelting point. Atlower temperatures recovery proc-

temperatures. 2When n'=^,Eq.(13-6) becomes Andrade's equation
fortransient creep,

Logarithmic creep occurs atlowtemperatures andlowstresses, where
recovery cannot occur. Itisbelieved tobeatrueexhaustion process in
which therate-determining step istheactivation energy tomove adis-
location. Ontheinitial application ofstress, thedislocations with the
lowest activation energy move first toproduce the initial creep strain.
Asthese easy-to-move dislocations areexhausted, creep cancontinue only
bythemovement ofdislocations ofhigher activation energy. Therefore,
theactivation energy fortheprocess continuously increases, andthecreep
ratedecreases. Theoretical treatments ofexhaustion creep that result in
alogarithmic equation have beenproposed byMott andNabarro* and
Cottrell.4
Low-temperature logarithmic creep obeys amechanical equation of
state; i.e.,therate ofstrain atagiven timedepends onlyontheinstan-
taneous values ofstress andstrain andnotontheprevious strain history.
However, creep athigher temperatures isstrongly dependent onprior
strain andthermal history andhence doesnotfollow amechanical equa-
tion ofstate.

transient creep. Thedecreasing creep rateduring transient creep arises
from theincreasing dislocation density andtheformation oflow-angle
boundaries. Therecovery mechanisms operating during transient creep
arenotwell established. Analysis ofexisting data^ indicates that the
escape ofscrew dislocations from pile-ups bycross slipmaybethechief
recovery mechanism infeemetals.
13-7. Theories ofHish-temperaturc Creep
Steady-state, orsecondary, creep predominates attemperatures above
about T'm/2. Although there issome question whether atruesteady-
state condition isachieved forallcombinations ofstress andtemperature,
there isample experimental evidence toindicate thatapproximate steady-
state conditions areachieved After ashort period oftesting inthehigh-
temperature region. Steady-state creep arises because ofabalance
between strain hardening andrecovery. The effects ofstrain hardening
arerecovered bytheescape ofscrew dislocations from pile-ups bycross
slipandtheescape ofedge dislocations byclimb. Since dislocation
climb hasahigher activation energy than cross slip, itwillbetherate-
controlling step insteady-state creep.
Orowan- firstsuggested that steady-state creep could betreated asa
balance between strain hardening andrecovery. If istheslope ofthe
stress-strain curve attheapplied stress aand r=da/dt istherate of
recovery oftheflow stress onannealing, then thesteady-state condition

Theories ofsteady-state creep based onEyring's chemical theory of

adjoining slip planes, forming low-angle boundaries. The activation
energy forthisprocess istheactivation energy forself-diffusion. A
steady state isestablished between thegeneration ofdislocations and
their annihilation. Analternative dislocation model ofsteady-state
creep proposed byMott^ considers that therate-controlling process is
theformation ofvacancies duetothemovement ofjogsonscrew dis-

rupture curves tolonger times canbemade onlywhen itiscertain that
nostructural changes occur intheregion ofextrapolation which would
produce achange intheslope ofthecurve. Since structural changes

hasbeen found toprovide satisfactory correlation ofthedata. In
general, these parameters provide useful methods forpresenting large
numbers ofdatathrough theuseofmaster plots oflogstress vs.time-
temperature parameter. Considerable usehasbeenmade ofthese
parameters forpredicting long-time data onthebasis ofshort-time
results. While there isnoassurance that erroneous predictions will
notresult from thisprocedure, itisgenerally considered thattheuseof
these parameters forthispurpose willprobably give better results than
simple graphical extrapolation oflog-log plotsbyoneortwologarithmic
cycles.
Ashort-cut approach tohigh-temperature properties isthrough the
useofthehot-hardness test. There arecertain parallelisms between
high-temperature strength results andhot-hardness data. Just asa
linear relationship exists between stress andthelogarithm oftherupture
time, asimilar relationship holds between hothardness andthelogarithm
oftheindentation time. InSec.11-10 itwasshown thatalinear rela-
tion exists between hothardness andtensile strength. Figure 13-12 illus-
trates asimilar relation between hothardness andhigh-temperature
strength.^ From theleft-hand ordinate wegettherelationship between
tensile strength orcreep strength andhothardness. However, eachpoint
onthecurve establishes acertain value oftheLarson-Miller parameter
along theright-hand ordinate. Thus, with avalue ofhigh-temperature
stress andavalue oftheparameter wecanestablish values oftemper-
ature andrupture time. Thisprocedure hasbeen verified forboth single-
phase alloys andcomplex multiphase high-temperature alloys. Itisa
useful method forobtaining high-temperature properties ofcomparatively
brittle materials. Ontheother hand, tests ofthistype givenoindication
oftheductility ofthematerial, which incertain casesmay beamore
controlling factor than thestrength.

High-temperature alloys areaparticular class ofcomplex materials
developed foravery specific application. Some appreciation ofthe
metallurgical principles behind thedevelopment ofthese alloys isimpor-
tant toanunderstanding ofhow metallurgical variables influence creep
behavior. Thedevelopment ofhigh-temperature alloys has, inthemain,
been theresult ofpainstaking, empirical investigation, and itisreally
only inretrospect that principles underlying these developments have
become evident.

increased temperature requirements insteam power plants. They are
essentially carbon steels, with increased chromium andmolybdenum to

oxidation andtheinstability ofthecarbide phase these alloys arelimited
inusetoabout 1000°F. Owing totheincreased oxidation resistance of
austenitic stainless steels, these alloys extend theuseful stress-bearing
range toabout 1200°F.
Thesuperalloys forjet-engine applications arebased oneither nickel
orcobalt austenitic alloys orcombinations ofthetwo. Ingeneral the>
contain appreciable chromium foroxidation resistance. Single-phase
solid-solution alloys such asNichrome (Ni-Cr) andaustenitic stainless
steelbecome weak above about 1300°F. Superalloys, therefore, are
multiphase alloys which attain their strength primarily from adis-
persion ofstable second-phase particles. Inthecobalt-base alloys and
certain complex Ni-Co-Cr-Fe alloys likeN-155, S-590, andS-816 the
second-phase particles arecomplex metal carbides. Molybdenum, tung-
sten,andcolumbium areadded tothese alloys toform stable complex
carbides. Thecarbon content ofthese alloys isusually critical andmust
becontrolled carefully. Increasing thecarbon content uptoacertain
limit increases theamount ofcarbide particles, andhence therupture
strength isincreased. However, iftoomuch carbon ispresent, thecar-
bides willnolonger bepresent asdiscrete particles. Instead, massive
carbide networks formandreduce therupture strength. Certain carbide
systems undergo aseries ofcomplex aging reactions whichmay result in
additional strengthening.
Nickel-base superalloys maybestrengthened bytheaddition ofsmall
amounts ofAland/or Ti.Theintermetallic compounds NisAl orNiaTi
areformed bythese additions. Uptothree outofevery fiveatoms of
AlinNisAlmaybereplaced byTi,toform Ni3(Al,Ti). Since thiscom-
pound produces greater hardening than NisAl, itiscustomary toadd
both AlandTitothese nickel-base alloys. Nickel-base alloys contain-
ingAlandTiaretrueage-hardening systems, sothat their high-tem-
perature strength depends ontheability ofthesystem toresist overaging.
Theheattreatment must becarefully controlled toputthese alloys inthe
condition ofmaximum particle stability. This canbedestroyed ifthe
service conditions fluctuate above theoptimum aging temperature.
Anew class ofdispersion-strengthened high-temperature alloys are
being developed inwhich thermally stable second-phase particles, chiefly
AI2O3, Si02,andZr02, areintroduced intoametal matrix byartificial
means.^Theprototype forthisdevelopment wasthesintered alumi-
num-powder (SAP) alloy, inwhich fineAI2O3 particles were dispersed in
analuminum matrix owing tothebreakoff ofsurface oxide during the
extrusion ofsintered aluminum powder. Atpresent mostdevelopments
arecentered inthepreparation ofadispersion-hardened alloybypowder-
metallurgy methods. Mixtures offineoxides andmetal powders are

nickel alloys prepared inthiswayshow that thestress-rupture curves
foradispersion-strengthened alloy drop offmuch lessrapidly withtime
than forthesame metal without second-phase particles. Bycomparing
onthebasis ofrupture time atagiven stress, improvements of1,000 per
centhavebeenreported fordispersion-strengthened alloys, while increases
inrupture stress at100hrofover 10,000 psihavebeenfound fornickel.

Theproduction ofartificial dispersion-strengthened alloys offers con-
siderable promise, since inprinciple itpermits theuseofasecond-phase
particle withmaximum resistance togrowth, andatthesame time the
sizeandamount oftheparticles canbecontrolled.
Ananalogous approach isthedevelopment ofcermets, inwhich ceramic
particles such asborides, carbides, and silicides arecombined with a
metallic binder bypowder-metallurgy methods. Cermets haveshown
very high strength at1800°F, buttheir usehasbeen limited owing to
poor ductility andinsufficient thermal- andmechanical-shock resistance.
Thehigh-temperature strength ofmetals isapproximately related to

Sec.13-11] Creep and Stress Rupture 363
their melting points. Forexample, aluminum hasbetter high-temper-
ature strength than zinc,andcopper isbetter thanaluminum. Titanium,
chromium, columbium, molybdenum, tantalum, andtungsten, inorder
ofincreasing melting point, aretherelatively common metals with melt-
ingpoints greater than iron, cobalt, andnickel, theprincipal constituents
ofpresent-day superalloys. Although thehigh-temperature strength of
titanium hasnotproved tobesogreat aswould beexpected onthebasis
ofitsmelting point, molybdenum and itsalloys have thebesthigh-tem-
perature strength ofanycommon metals available atthepresent time.
Figure 13-13, which shows thestress forrupture in1,000 hratdifferent
temperatures foranumber ofengineering materials, illustrates thesuperi-
ority ofmolybdenum. Unfortunately, theuseofmolybdenum islimited
bythefactthat itundergoes catastrophic oxidation atelevated temper-
ature. Oxidation-resistance coatings formolybdenum arebeing used to
acertain extent. Extensive development ofways ofpreparing, purifying,
andfabricating theother refractory metals isunder way. Thiswork
includes asearch formethods ofincreasing their oxidation resistance and
high-temperature strength byalloying.
13-11. EFfect ofMetallursical Variables
Thehigh-temperature creep andstress-rupture strengths areusually
higher forcoarse-grain material than forafine-grain-size metal. This,
ofcourse, isincontrast tothebehavior atlower temperature, where a
decrease ingrain sizeresults inanincrease instrength. Thebasic effect
ofgrain sizeonhigh-temperature strength isclouded because itispracti-
cally impossible tochange thegrain sizeofcomplex superalloys without
inadvertently changing some other factor such asthecarbide spacing or
theaging response. Infact, Parker' hasproposed that theobserved
dependence ofhigh-temperature strength ongrain size isbasically incor-
rect. Formerly itwassuggested that thelower creep strength offine
grain material wasduetogreater grain-boundary areaavailable forgrain-
boundary sliding. However, work which indicates thatgrain-boundary
sliding canaccount foronlyabout 10percent ofthetotal creep strain
hascastdoubt onthisexplanation.
Since high-temperature creep depends ondislocation climb, which in
turndepends upon therate atwhich vacancies candiffuse toedge dis-
locations, Parker feels that thegrain-size effect oncreep isduetothe
effect ofgrain-boundary structure onvacancy diffusion. Vacancy diffu-
sion ismore rapid along high-energy grain boundaries thanthrough the
bulk lattice. Therefore, with fine-grain material withmany high-angle
grain boundaries dislocation climb willberapid, andthecreep rate ishigh.
1E.R.Parker, Trans.ASM, vol. 50,pp.52-104, 1958.

364 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 13
However, when thesame material isheated toahightemperature to
coarsen thegrain size,most ofthehigh-energy grain boundaries disappear
owing tograin growth. Theboundaries which remain aremostly lower-
energy grain boundaries, forwhich vacancy diffusion isrelatively slow.
Therefore, dislocation climb willbeslower inthecoarse-grain material.
The factthat low-angle grain boundaries improve creep properties is
shown inFig. 13-14. Networks oflow-angle boundaries wereproduced
innickel bystraining smallamounts intension atroom temperature and
annealing at800°C. Note thechange inshape ofthecreep curves and
thedecreasing creep rate asmoreandmore low-angle grain boundaries
were introduced, with greater prestrain. Recent experiments byParker

inwhich thegrain sizeofcopper waschanged without changing thepro-
portion oflow-angle andhigh-angle grain boundaries have showai that
thecreep rateincreases with increasing grain size. Thus, itappears asif
thefundamental dependence ofcreep rateongrain size isnodifferent
from thedependence ofstrength ongrain sizeatlowtemperature. How-
ever, secondary effects which accompany thechange ingrain sizewhen it
isaccomplished bycommercial annealing procedures areresponsible for
theeffect which isusually observed.
Comparison oftheproperties ofcastandforged high-temperature
alloys inthesame state ofheattreatment shows that cast alloys gener-
allyhavesomewhat higher hotstrength andcreep resistance than forgings
attemperatures above theequicohesive temperature. Thereasons for

Sec.13-11] Creep and Stress Rupture 365
thisarenotwellestablished, but itappears that itisrelated toastrength-
ening from thedendritic structure ofthecasting. Advantages canbe
ascribed toboth casting andforging asamethod ofproduction forhigh-
temperature alloys. Most high-temperature alloys arehot-worked only
with difficulty. There arecertain alloys, particularly cobalt-base alloys,
which cannot behot-worked, andtherefore theymust beproduced as
castings. Although castings showsomewhat better strength than forg-
ings, theproduction conditions must becarefully controlled toprovide
uniform properties. Variations ingrain sizeduetochanges insection
sizemaybeaproblem with castings. Because oftheirworked structure,
forgings aremore ductile than castings, andgenerally theyshow fatigue
properties which aresuperior tothose ofcastings.
Since high-temperature alloys aredesigned toresist deformation at
hightemperatures, itisnotsurprising tofindthatthey present problems
inmechanical w^orking andfabrication. Hotworking ofsuperalloys for
ingotbreakdown isgenerally done intherange 1700 to2200°F. Itshould
berecognized thatworking highly alloyed materials likesuperalloys does
notconstitute truehotworking since residual strains willbeleftinthe
lattice. Forthisreason theresulting properties ofage-hardenable alloys
aredependent onthehot-working conditions. Therupture properties
ofcertain nonaging solid-solution alloys like 16-25-6, N-155, andS-816
areappreciably improved bycontrolled amounts ofreduction intherange
1200 to1700°F. Thisprocedure isknown ashot-cold working, orwarm
working. Deformation inthistemperature region forthese highly alloyed
materials isabout equivalent toworking mild steel atroom temperature.
Warm working and coldworking atroom temperature oflesshighly
alloyed materials produce higher creep strength because oftheenergy
stored inthelattice asaresult oftheplastic deformation. Foragiven
operating temperature there willbeacritical amount ofcoldworkbeyond
which theincreased lattice strain causes rapid recovery andrecrystalliza-
tion. The critical amount ofcoldwork decreases astheoperating tem-
perature isincreased.
Ingeneral, there islittle correlation between room-temperature
strength andhigh-temperature strength. Forexample, theincorpo-
ration ofadispersion offineoxide particles inthemetal matrix may
produce only amodest increase inroom-temperature strength, butthe
improvement inrupture time atelevated temperature maybeathousand-
fold. Theimportance ofusing athermally stable metallurgical structure
forlong-time high-temperature service iswell illustrated bythecase of
low-alloy steels. Although aquenched andtempered martensitic struc-
ture offinecarbides hasthebeststrength atroom temperature andmay
have good strength forshort times upto1100°F, onlongexposure at
elevated temperature thecarbides grow and coalesce and thecreep

properties arevery poor. Much better creep properties areobtained if
thesteel isinitially inthestable annealed condition. Theproblem of
selecting thebestheattreatment foracomplex superalloy isfrequently
difficult. Acompromise must bereached between thefineness ofthe
dispersion ofsecond-phase particles andtheir thermal stability. Assum-
ingthat thetransformation characteristics forthealloy arecompletely
known, which isusually notthecase, theselection oftheheattreatment
would bebased ontheexpected service temperature andtherequired
service life.One ofthedifficulties which must beguarded against isthe
formation ofgrain-boundary precipitates, which lead tointergranular
fracture.
High-temperature properties canshow considerable scatter, and fre-
quently measurably different results areobtained between different heats
ofthesame material orevenbetween different barsfrom thesame heat.
The creep properties ofsteels areparticularly subject tovariations in
properties, which arerelated incomplex ways tothecomposition, melting
practice, type ofmechanical working, andmicrostructure. Aluminum
deoxidized steels generally have poorer creep properties than silicon deoxi-
dized steels. Notonly doesaluminum refine thegrain size,but italso
accelerates spheroidization and graphitization. Considerable improve-
ment inthehigh-temperature properties ofsuperalloys results from
vacuum melting. Fabricability isalsoimproved, presumably because
ofthedecrease inthenumber and sizeofinclusions. Ingeneral, lifeto
rupture andductility atfracture areboth increased byvacuum melting.
Better control ofcomposition, andtherefore more uniform response to
heattreatment, isobtained withvacuum melting.
Theenvironment surrounding thespecimen canhave animportant
influence onhigh-temperature strength. Creep testsonzinc single crys-
talsshowed that creep practically stopped when copper wasplated on
thesurface ofthespecimens.^ When thecopper was electrolytically
removed, creep began again atnearly theoriginal rate. Stress-rupture
testsonnickel andnickel-chromium alloys show acomplex dependence
onatmosphere.^ Athightemperatures andlowstrain rates these mate-
rials arestronger inairthan invacuum, while thereverse istrue atlow
temperatures andhigh strain rates. This behavior isattributed tothe
competing effects ofstrengthening resulting from oxidation andweaken-
ingduetolowering ofthesurface energy byabsorbed gases. Thenature
oftheoxidation canhaveanimportant influence onthehigh-temperature
properties. Athin oxide layer orafinely dispersed oxide willusually
lead tostrengthening, butintergranular penetration ofoxide willusually
lead todecreased rupture lifeandintergranular fracture. When mate-

Considerable attention hasbeen given totheproblem ofdesign for
combined stress conditions during steady-state creep.^Intheabsence
ofmetallurgical changes, thebasic simplifying assumptions ofplasticity
theory (see Sec. 3-8)hold reasonably well forthese conditions. The
assumption ofincompressible material leads tothefamiliar relationship

BRITTLE FAILURE
ANDIMPACT TESTING
14-1. The Brittle-failure Problem
During World War IIagreat deal ofattention wasdirected tothe
brittle failure ofwelded Liberty shipsandT-2tankers.^ Some ofthese
ships broke completely intwo, while, inother instances, thefracture did
notcompletely disable theship. Most ofthefailures occurred during
thewinter months. Failures occurred bothwhen theshipswere inheavy
seasandwhen theywereanchored atdock. These calamities focused
attention onthefactthatnormally ductile mild steelcanbecome brittle
under certain conditions. Abroad research program wasundertaken
tofindthecauses ofthese failures andtoprescribe theremedies fortheir
future prevention. Inaddition toresearch designed tofindanswers to
apressing problem, other research wasaimed atgaining abetter under-
standing ofthemechanism ofbrittle fracture andfracture ingeneral.
Many oftheresults ofthisbasicwork aredescribed inChap. 7,which
should bereviewed before proceeding further with thischapter. While
thebrittle failure ofships concentrated great attention onbrittle failure
inmild steel, itisimportant tounderstand that this isnottheonly appli-
cation where brittle fracture isaproblem. Brittle failures intanks,
pressure vessels, pipelines, andbridges havebeendocumented^ asfarback
astheyear 1886.
Three basic factors contribute toabrittle-cleavage type offracture.
They are (1)atriaxial state ofstress, (2)alowtemperature, and (3)a
high strain rate orrapid rate ofloading. Allthree ofthese factors do
nothave tobepresent atthesame time toproduce brittle fracture. A

triaxial state ofstress, such asexists atanotch, andlowtemperature are
responsible formost service failures ofthebrittle type. However, since
these effects areaccentuated atahigh rate ofloading, many types of
impact testshave been used todetermine thesusceptibility ofmaterials
tobrittle fracture. Steels which have identical properties when tested in
tension ortorsion atslow strain rates canshowpronounced differences in
theirtendency forbrittle fracture when tested inanotched-impact test.
However, there arecertain disadvantages tothistype oftest, sothat
much work hasbeendevoted tothedevelopment ofadditional tests for
defining thetendency forbrittle fracture, andmuch effort hasbeen
expended incorrelating theresults ofdifferent brittle-fracture tests.
Since theship failures occurred primarily instructures ofwelded con-
struction, itwasconsidered foratime that thismethod offabrication
wasnotsuitable forservice where brittle fracture might beencountered.
Agreat deal ofresearch hassince demonstrated that welding, per se,
isnotinferior inthisrespect toother types ofconstruction. However,
strict quality control isneeded toprevent weld defects which canactas
stress raisers ornotches. New electrodes havebeendeveloped thatmake
itpossible tomake aweldwith better properties than themild-steel plate.
Thedesign ofawelded structure ismore critical than thedesign ofan
equivalent riveted structure, andmuch effort hasgone intothedevelop-
ment ofsafedesigns forwelded structures. Itisimportant toeliminate
allstress raisers andtoavoid making thestructure too rigid. Tothis
end,riveted sections, known ascrack arresters, wereincorporated insome
ofthewartime ships sothat, ifabrittle failure didoccur, itwould not
propagate completely through thestructure.
14-2. Notched-bar Impact Tests
Various types ofnotched-bar impact tests areused todetermine the
tendency ofamaterial tobehave inabrittle manner. Thistype oftest
willdetect differences between materials which arenotobservable ina
tension test. Theresults obtained fromnotched-bar tests arenotreadily
expressed interms ofdesign requirements, since itisnotpossible tomeas-
urethecomponents ofthetriaxial stress condition atthenotch. Further-
more, there isnogeneral agreement ontheinterpretation orsignificance
ofresults obtained with thistype oftest.
Alargenumber ofnotched-bar testspecimens ofdifferent design
have been usedbyinvestigators ofthebrittle fracture ofmetals. Two
classes ofspecimens havebeen standardized^ fornotched-impact testing.
Charpy barspecimens areusedmostcommonly intheUnited States,

principal stresses depend strongly onthedimensions ofthebarandthe

depends chiefly ontherelationship between thewidth ofthebarandthe
notch radius. Thewider thebarinrelation totheradius ofthenotch,
thegreater thetransverse stress.
Theresponse ofaspecimen totheimpact test isusually measured by
theenergy absorbed infracturing thespecimen. Formetals this isusu-
allyexpressed infoot-pounds and isread directly from acalibrated dial
ontheimpact tester. InEurope impact results arefrequently expressed
inenergy absorbed perunit cross-sectional area ofthespecimen. Very
often ameasure ofductility, such asthepercent contraction atthe

examine thefracture surface todetermine whether itisfibrous (shear

than keyhole specimens. The transition temperature foragiven steel
willbedifferent fordifferent-shaped specimens andfordifferent types
ofloading with different states ofstress. The correlation oftransition
temperatures measured indifferent ways willbediscussed inalater
section.
Because thetransition temperature isnotsharply defined, itisimpor-
tant tounderstand thecriteria which havebeenadopted foritsdefinition.
Themost suitable criterion forselecting thetransition temperature is
whether ornot itcorrelates with service performance. Ingeneral, cri-
teria fordetermining thetransition temperature arebased onatransition
inenergy absorbed, change intheappearance ofthefracture, oratran-
sition intheductility, asmeasured bythecontraction attheroot ofthe
notch.' Figure 14-4shows that thesame type ofcurve isobtained for
each criterion. This figure also illustrates therelative shapes ofthe
curves obtained with keyhole andV-notch Charpy specimens. The
energy transition temperature forV-notch Charpy specimens isfre-
quently setatalevel of10or15ft-lb. Where thefracture appearance
changes gradually from shear through mixtures ofshear andcleavage
tocomplete cleavage, with decreasing temperature, thetransition tem-
perature isfrequently selected tocorrespond toatemperature where
50percent fibrous (shear) fracture isobtained. Theductility transition
temperature issometimes arbitrarily setat1percent lateral contraction
atthenotch. One characteristic ofthese criteria isthat atransition
temperature based onfracture appearance always occurs atahigher tem-
perature than ifbased onaductility orenergy criterion.

Theslowbending offlat-beam specimens inatesting machine issome-
times used asamethod ofdetermining thetransition temperature. A
biaxial state ofstress isproduced during thebending ofanunnotched
beam when thewidth ismuch greater than thethickness. When the
ratio ofwidth tothickness isclose tounity, thestress isessentially uni-
axial, butasthewidth increases, theratio ofthetransverse tolongi-
tudinal stress approaches avalue of}'2,thecondition forastate ofplane

iscutwith ajeweler's saw atoneside ofthespecimen. This side is
cooled with liquid nitrogen, andtheother side iskept atahigher tem-
perature. Thus, atemperature gradient ismaintained across thewidth
ofthespecimen. Acrack isstarted atthecoldendbyanimpact gun.
Theenergy available from theimpact isnotsufficient tomake thecrack
grow very large, buttheapplied tensile stress tends tokeep itgrowing.
Thecrack travels across thewidth ofthespecimen until itreaches a
point where thetemperature ishighenough topermit enough yielding
tostop thecrack. This occurs when theplastic deformation required
forfurther spread ofthecrack cannot besupplied bythestored elastic
energy. Foreach applied tensile stress there isatemperature above
which thecrack willnotpropagate. Robertson's datashowed that this
arrest temperature decreases sharply formost mild-steel plates when the
applied tensile stress islowered toabout 10,000 psi. Forthese steels
thecrack willnotbearrested ifthestress exceeds thisvalue andthe
temperature isbelow room temperature. This testhasbeen modified
forusewithout atemperature gradient.^
Thedrop-weight testwasdeveloped bytheNaval Research Labo-
ratory^ tomeasure susceptibility totheinitiation ofbrittle fracture in
thepresence ofacracklike notch. Thespecimen isaflatplate with a
3-in.-long bead ofhard-facing metal applied atthecenter andnotched to
halfdepth. Thewelded side ofthespecimen isplaced facedown over
endsupports, andthecenter ofthespecimen isstruck witha60-lb falling
weight. Thebead ofhard-facing metal cracks inabrittle manner, pro-
ducing asharp, cracklike notch. Since thepurpose ofthedrop-weight
test istoseewhether ornotfracture willoccur atasharp notch when
theamount ofyielding thatcanoccur isrestricted, thebending fixture is
designed soastolimit thedeflection ofthespecimen to5°.Only 3°of
bend isneeded toproduce acrack inthebrittle weld bead. Theaddi-
tional 2°ofbend provides atest ofwhether ornotthesteelcandeform
inthepresence ofthecracklike notch. This isa"go-no go"type oftest
inthat atagiven temperature thespecimen either fractures completely or
remains intact. Thehighest temperature offracture istermed thenil-

controlled explosion. Theexplosion produces acompressive shock wave
which isreflected from thebottom oftheplate asatensile wave. This
test isinterpreted interms oftheappearance ofthefracture intheplate.
Atahigher temperature theplate bulges, butthecracks stillruntothe
edges oftheplate. At stillhigher temperatures theplate bulges con-
siderably more, andthecrack becomes ashear crack which isconfined to
thecenter ofthespecimen. Thefracture-appearance transition temper-
ature isselected asthetemperature atwhich cracking isconfined tothe
bulged region oftheplate. Formost steels thistransition temperature
will fall40to60°Fabove thenil-ductility transition ofthedrop-weight

establishes atemperature below which thematerial isvery susceptible
tofracture initiation, while theexplosion-bulge testestablishes atemper-
ature above which thematerial isimmune tobrittle-fracture propagation.
14-5. SisniFicance oftheTransition Temperature
Thenotch toughness ofamaterial should really beconsidered in
terms oftwo distinct transition temperatures. Figure 14-7shows the

tility transition temperature isre-
lated tothe fracture-initiation
tendencies ofthematerial. Com-
pletely brittle cleavage fracture
occurs readily below theductility
transition temperature. Thefrac-
ture-appearance transition temper-
ature isrelated tothecrack-prop-
agation characteristics ofthe
material. Above the fracture
transition temperature cracks do
not propagate catastrophically,
because fracture occurs bythe
shear mode with appreciable ab-
sorption ofenergy. Intheregion between thesetwotransition temper-
atures fractures are difficult toinitiate, butonce initiated theypropa-
gaterapidly with little energy absorption.
Actual materials donothave two distinct transition temperatures
such aswereshown inFig. 14-7. Instead, Fig.14-8 ismore character-
istic ofthetype ofcurves that areobtained withCharpy V-notch tests
onmild steel. The ductility transition temperature usually occurs atTemperature —>

anenergy- level of5to20ft-lb. Frequently avalue of15ft-lb isused to
establish thistransition temperature. The ductility transition temper-
aturemay alsobedetermined frommeasurements ofthecontraction at
theroot ofthenotch. Thefracture-appearance transition temperature
ismeasured bythepercentshear inthefracture surface. Usually itis
taken atthetemperature atwhich 50percent fibrous fracture isobtained.
Thefracture transition temperature always occurs atahigher temper-
ature than theductility transition temperature. Foragiven material

lessofspecimen geometry, notch sharpness, andrate ofloading. Onthe

There isnogeneral correlation between anyofthebrittle-fracture tests
andservice performance. The greatest number ofdata exist forfailed
hullplates inwelded ships. Tests onthese steels showed thatthey all
hadCharpy V-notch values of11.4 ft-lb orlesswhen tested atthe
temperature atwhich failure occurred. Experience withrimmed and
semikilled mild-steel plates inthicknesses upto1in.indicates that a
minimum Charpy V-notch value of15ft-lb atthelowest operating tem-
perature should prevent brittle fracture ifthenominal stresses areofthe
order ofone-half theyield point. Forhigher alloy steels ahigher value
ofminimum impact resistance mayberequired.

oftransition-temperature criteria. Comparisons should notbemade
between testresults where thetwo criteria havebeen mixed. Forexam-
ple,nocorrelation isfound between thekeyhole andV-notch Charpy
testswhen thetransition temperature ismeasured atalevel correspond-
ingto50percent ofthemaximum energy. This isbecause the50per
centenergy level isclose totheductility transition forthekeyhole speci-
menbutnear thefracture transition fortheV-notch specimen. Good
correlation isfound between thetwospecimens when they areboth evalu-
atedwithcommon ductility criteria. Further, good correlation hasbeen
obtained' between thenil-ductility transition measured bythedrop-
weight testandtheCharpy V-notch test. Good correlation hasbeen
shown between thedrop-weight-test nil-ductility transition andservice
fractures. Thecorrelation problem iswell illustrated bythework ofthe
Ship Structure Committee.^
14-6. Metallurgical Factors Affecting Transition Temperature
Changes intransition temperature ofover100°F canbeproduced by
changes inthechemical composition ormicrostructure ofmild steel.
The largest changes intransition temperature result from changes inthe
amount ofcarbon andmanganese.^ The 15-ft-lb transition temperature
forV-notch Charpy specimens (ductility transition) israised about 25°F
foreach increase of0.1percentcarbon. This transition temperature is
lowered about 10°F foreach increase of0.1percentmanganese. Increas-
ingthecarbon content alsohasapronounced effect onthemaximum
energy andtheshape oftheenergy transition-temperature curves (Fig.
14-9). TheMn:C ratio should beatleast 3:1forsatisfactory notch
toughness. Amaximum decrease ofabout 100°F intransition temper-
ature appears possible bygoing tohigherMn :Cratios. The practical
limitations toextending thisbeyond 7 :1arethatmanganese contents
above about 1.4percent lead totrouble with retained austenite, while
about 0.2percentcarbon isneeded tomaintain therequired tensile
properties.
Phosphorus alsohasastrong effect inraising thetransition temper-
ature. The 15-ft-lb V-notch Charpy transition temperature israised
about 13°F foreach 0.01percentphosphorus. Since itisnecessary to
control phosphorus, itisnotgenerally advisable tousesteelmadebythe
Bessemer process forlow-temperature applications. The roleofnitrogen
isdifficult toassess because ofitsinteraction with other elements. Itis,

however, generally considered tobedetrimental tonotch toughness.
Nickel isgenerally accepted tobebeneficial tonotch toughness in
amounts upto2percentandseems tobeparticularly effective inlower-
ingthe ductility transition temperature. Silicon, inamounts over
0.25percent,appears toraise thetransition temperature. Molybdenum
raises thetransition almost asrapidly ascarbon, while chromium has
little effect.
Notch toughness isparticularly influenced byoxygen. Forhigh-purity
iron^ itwasfound thatoxygen contents above 0.003 percentproduced
intergranular fracture andcorresponding lowenergy absorption. When
theoxygen content wasraised from 0.001 percent tothehigh value of

0.057 percent, thetransition temperature wasraised from 5to650°F.
Inview ofthese results, itisnotsurprising thatdeoxidation practice has
animportant effect onthetransition temperature. Rimmed steel, with
itshigh iron oxide content, generally shows atransition temperature
above room temperature. Semikilled steels, which aredeoxidized with
silicon, have alower transition temperature, while forsteels which are
fully killed with silicon plusaluminum the15ft-lb transition temper-
ature willbearound —75°F. Aluminum alsohasthebeneficial effect of
combining with nitrogen toform insoluble aluminum nitride. Theuse
ofafully killed deoxidation practice isnotacompletely practical answer
totheproblem ofmaking steel plate with highnotch toughness because
there isonly limited capacity forthistype ofproduction.

ofoneASTM number intheferrite grain size (actually adecrease in
grain diameter) can result inadecrease intransition temperature of
30°F formild steel. Decreasing thegrain diameter fromASTM grain
size5toASTM grain size10canchange the10-ft-lb Charpy V-notch
transition temperature^ from about 70to—60°F.Asimilar effect of
decreasing transition temperature with decreasing austenite grain size is
observed withhigher alloyed heat-treated steels. Many ofthevariables
concerned with processing mild steel affect the ferrite grain sizeand
therefore affect thetransition temperature. Since normalizing after hot
rolling results inagrain refinement, ifnotcarried outattoohigh atem-
perature, thistreatment results inreduced transition temperature. The
cooling ratefrom thenormalizing treatment andthedeoxidation practice
arevariables which alsomust beconsidered. Aircooling andaluminum
deoxidation result inalower transition temperature. Using thelowest
possible finishing temperature forhotrolling ofplate isalso beneficial.
Foragiven chemical composition anddeoxidation practice, thetran-
sition temperature willbeappreciably higher inthick hot-rolled plates
than inthin plates. This isduetothedifficulty ofobtaining uniformly
finepearlite andgrain sizeinathick section. Generally speaking, allow-
ance forthiseffectmust bemade inplates greater than^in.inthickness.
Thenotch toughness ofsteel isgreatly influenced bymicrostructure.
The bestnotch toughness isobtained with amicrostructure which is
completely tempered martensite. Acompletely pearlitic structure has
poor notch toughness, andastructure which ispredominately bainite
isintermediate between these two. Asanexample oftheeffect ofmicro-
structure ontransition temperature, inanSAE4340 steel forwhich a
tempered martensitic structure and pearlitic structure werecompared at
thesame hardness, itwasfound thattheCharpy-keyhole transition tem-
perature at25ft-lbwas350°F lower forthetempered martensitic struc-
ture. Further discussion ofthenotch toughness ofheat-treated steels
willbefound inSec. 14-8.
Low-carbon steels canexhibit twotypes ofaging phenomena which
produce anincrease intransition temperature. Quench aging iscaused
bycarbide precipitation inalow-carbon steelwhich hasbeenquenched
fromaround 1300°F. Strain aging occurs inlow-carbon steelwhich has
been cold-worked. Coldworking byitself willincrease thetransition
temperature, butstrain aging results inagreater increase, usually around
40to60°F. Quench aging results inlesslossofimpact properties than
strain aging. Thephenomenon ofblue hrittleness, inwhich adecrease in
impact resistance occurs onheating toaround 400°F, isduetostrain
aging.

Fig.14-10 shows thatquite large differences canbeexpected fordifferent

peratures areevaluated inthisregion ofenergy, itseems thatspecimen
andnotch orientation arenotaveryimportant variable forthiscriterion.
If,however, materials arecompared onthebasis ofroom-temperature
impact properties, orientation cangreatly affect theresults.
14-7. Effect ofSection Size
Difficulty with brittle fracture usually increases asthesizeofthestruc-
ture increases. This isduetoboth metallurgical andgeometrical factors.

Sec.14-8] Brittle Failure andImpact Testing 385
Intheprevious section itwasshown thatthetransition temperature ofa
given steel usually decreases with increasing plate thickness because of
theincreased grain sizeproduced inhot-rolling thick plates. However,
Charpy tests onspecimens ofvarying sizebutidentical metallurgical
structure andgeometrically similar notches show that there isasize
effect. Atsome temperature thelargest specimens willbecompletely
brittle, while thesmall specimens willbecompletely ductile. The frac-
tures forin-between specimens willvaryfrom almost fully ductile to
almost fully brittle.
Adramatic demonstration ofsize effect wasobtained intests ofship
hatch corners carried outattheUniversity ofCalifornia. Full scale,
one-half scale, andone-quarter scalemodels were tested. These models
were similar inalldetails andweremade from thesame material bythe
same welding procedures. When fracture strength wasmeasured in
terms ofpounds persquare inch ofthenetcross-sectional area, thefull-
sized specimen hadonlyabout one-half thestrength ofthequarter-scale
model.
The higher transition temperature orlower fracture stress oflarge
structures isduetotwo factors. The larger structure cancontain a
more unfavorable state ofstress duetostress raisers, and italsopro-
vides alarge reservoir forstored elastic energy. Since theGriffith cri-
terion requires that theelastic strain energy must provide thesurface
energy fortheformation ofthefracture surface, thegreater theavailable
stored energy, theeasier itisfortheattainment ofanuncontrollable,
rapidly spreading crack.
14-8. Notch Toughness ofHeat-treated Steels
Ithasbeen demonstrated many times that atempered martensitic
structure produces thebestcombination ofstrength andimpact resist-
ance ofanymicrostructure thatcanbeproduced insteel. InChap. 9
itwasshown that thetensile properties oftempered martensites ofthe
same hardness andcarbon content arealike, irrespective oftheamount
ofother alloy additions. This generalization holds approximately for
theroom-temperature impact resistance ofheat-treated steels, but itis
notvalid forthevariation ofimpact resistance with temperature. Fig-
ure14-11 shows thetemperature dependence ofimpact resistance fora
number ofdifferent alloy steels, allhaving about 0.4percentcarbon and
allwith atempered martensite structure produced byquenching and
tempering toahardness ofRe35.Note that amaximum variation of
about 200°F inthetransition temperature atthe20-ft-lb level ispossible.
Even greater spread intransition temperature would beobtained ifthe
tempering temperature were adjusted togiveahigher hardness.^ Slack

This canbecome aparticularly important problem withheavy sections
thatcannot becooled through thisregion rapidly enough tosuppress
embrittlement. Temper embrittlement alsocanbeproduced byiso-
thermal treatments inthistemperature region. The kinetics ofthe
process produces aC-shaped curve when some parameter ofembrittle-
ment isplotted ontemperature-time coordinates. More rapid embrittle-
ment results from slow cooling through thecritical temperature region
thanfrom isothermal treatment. Temper enibrittlement canbecom-
pletely eliminated fromanembrittled steelbyheating intotheaustenite
region andcooling rapidly through theembrittling temperature region.
Thepresence oftemper embrittlement isusually determined bymeas-
uring thetransition temperature bymeans ofanotched-bar impact test.
Thehardness and tensile properties arenotsensitive totheembrittle-
ment, except forveryextreme cases, butthetransition temperature can
beincreased around 200°F byordinary embrittling heattreatments. The
fracture ofatemper-embrittled steel isintergranular, while thebrittle
fracture ofanonembrittled steel istransgranular. This suggests that
temper brittleness isduetoagrain-boundary weakness. However, no
evidence foragrain-boundary film orprecipitate hasbeen uncovered
from studies bymeans oftheelectron microscope ofthemicrostructure
oftemper-embrittled steel. Therefore itisgenerally hypothesized that
temper embrittlement isduetothesegregation ofimpurities tothegrain
boundaries without theformation ofanobservable precipitate phase.
The effect ofvarious alloying elements onthisembrittlement canthenbe
explained onthebasis oftheir rates ofdiffusion andrelative solubilities
atthegrain boundaries andwithin thegrains. Much more information
isneeded before adetailed mechanism oftemper embrittlement canbe
determined.
Molybdenum istheonly alloying element which decreases thesuscepti-
bility totemper embrittlement. Thebest solution totheproblem isto
avoid tempering intheregion ofgreatest susceptibility toembrittlement.
Tempering atahigher temperature forashort timemaybebetter than
alongtempering treatment atalower temperature. Awater quench
from thetempering temperature willserve tominimize embrittlement
oncooling.
14-10. Hydroscn Embrittlement
Severe embrittlement canbeproduced inmany metals byvery small
amounts ofhydrogen. Body-centered cubic andhexagonal close-packed
metals aremost susceptible tohydrogen embrittlement. As little as

ment.^ Hydrogen may beintroduced during melting andentrapped
during solidification, oritmay bepicked upduring heat treatment,
electroplating, acid pickling, orwelding.
The chief characteristics ofhydrogen embrittlement areitsstrain-rate
sensitivity, itstemperature dependence, and itssusceptibility todelayed
fracture. Unlike most embrittling phenomena, hydrogen embrittlement
isenhanced byslow strain rates. Atlow^temperatures andhightem-
peratures hydrogen embrittlement isnegligible, but itismost severe in
some intermediate temperature region. For steel theregion ofgreatest
susceptibility tohydrogen embrittlement isinthevicinity ofroom tem-
perature. Slowbend testsandnotched andunnotched tension tests will
detect hydrogen embrittlement byadrastic decrease inductility, but
notched-impact tests areofnousefordetecting thephenomenon.
Acommon method ofstudying hydrogen embrittlement istocharge
notched tensile specimens with know^n amounts ofhydrogen, loadthem
todifferent stresses inadead-weight machine, andobserve thetime to
failure. Atypical delayed-fracture curve isshown inFig. 14-13. Note
thatthenotched tensile strength of
acharged specimen maybemuch
lower than thestrength ofahydro-
gen-free specimen. There isare-
gion inwhich thetime tofracture
depends only slightly ontheapplied
stress. There isalso aminimum
critical value below which delayed
fracture wnllnotoccur. Thesimi-
larity ofthedelayed fracture curve
tothefatigue S-Ncurve hasledto
theuseoftheterm "static fatigue"
forthedelayed-fracture phenome-
non. Theminimum critical stress,
or"static fatigue limit," increases with adecrease inhydrogen content
oradecrease intheseverity ofthenotch. Thehydrogen content of
steelmaybereduced by"baking," orheating ataround 300to500°F.
Hydrogen ispresent insolution asmonatomic hj^drogen. Because itis
asmall interstitial atom, itdiffuses very rapidly attemperatures above
room temperatvire. Acommonly heldconcept ofhydrogen embrittle-
ment isthatmonatomic hydrogen precipitates atinternal voids as
molecular hydrogen. These voids might betrue voids, microcracks, or
perhaps simply regions ofhigh dislocation density. Ashydrogen diffuses

intothevoids, thepressure builds upandproduces fracture. While this
concept explains thegeneral idea ofhydrogen embrittlement, itisnotin
agreement with alltheexperimental facts. Further insight into the
mechanism hasresulted from thework ofTroiano andcoworkers.^ By
determining therate ofcrack propagation bymeans ofresistivity meas-
urements theywere able toshow that thecrack propagates discontinu-
ously. This indicates thattherate ofcrack propagation iscontrolled by
thediffusion ofhydrogen totheregion ofhigh triaxial stress justahead
ofthecrack tip.When acritical hydrogen concentration isobtained,
asmall crack forms andgrows, tolinkupwith theprevious main crack.
The factthatthetime fortheinitiation ofthe firstcrack hasbeenfound
tobeinsensitive toapplied stress supports theidea that theproc-
essdepends ontheattainment ofacritical hydrogen concentration.
Themain effect ofstress istoassist intheaccumulation ofthisconcen-
tration. Theminimum critical stress inFig.14-13 canbeinterpreted
asthestress needed tocause acritical accumulation ofhydrogen. The
higher theaverage hydrogen content, thelower thenecessary critical
stress.
Theformation ofhairline cracks, orflakes, inlarge ingots andforgings
during cooling orroom-temperature aging haslongbeen attributed tothe
presence ofhydrogen. Studies^ offlake formation haveshown that in
addition tocontaining hydrogen thesteelmust besubjected totransfor-
mation stresses forflaking tooccur. Thehydrogen content necessary
forflaking varies widely with composition, size,andsegregation. Flakes
have been observed insteelwith aslowas3ppm ofhydrogen. Onthe
other hand, very highamounts ofhydrogen canbetolerated without
causing flakes ifthetransformation stresses areminimized bydecom-
posing theaustenite above theMstemperature before cooling toroom
temperature.

transmitted toallparts oftheloaded body. Rather, atabrief instant
after theloadhasbeen applied theremote portions ofthebody remain
undisturbed. Thedeformation and stress produced bytheloadmove
through thebody intheform ofawave that travels with avelocity ot
theorder ofseveral thousand feetpersecond. Compression waves are
generated inametalwhen itissubjected toanexplosive blast (impulsive
loading), while tensile waves canbeproduced byatension-impac\

392 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 14
Measurement ofthedynamic stress-strain curve isdifficult because of
theshort timeduring which events occur andbecause caremust betaken
toconsider allwave-propagation phenomena. Theinformation which is
available indicates that forshock loading thestress-strain curve israised
about 10to20percentcompared with thestatic curve. There isgener-
allyanincrease intheenergy tofracture with increasing impact velocity
uptothepoint where thecritical velocity isreached.
Marked differences occur between fracture under impulsive loads and
under static loads. With impulsive loads there isnottime forthestress
tobedisturbed throughout theentire body, sothatfracture canoccur in
onepart ofthebody independently ofwhat happens inanother part.
The velocity ofpropagation ofstress waves insolids liesintherange
3,000 to20,000 ft/sec, while thevelocity ofcrack propagation isabout
6,000 ft/sec. Therefore, with impulsive loads itmay befound that
cracks haveformed butdidnothave time topropagate before thestress
state changed. Reflections ofstress waves occur atfreesurfaces and
fixed ends, atchanges incross section, andatdiscontinuities within the
metal. Acompression wave isreflected from asurface asatension wave,
and itisthisreflected tension wave which inmost cases causes fracture
under impulsive loading. When athick plate issubjected toexplosive
loading against one surface, theinterference from theincident and
reflected wave from theopposite surface willcause atensile stress tobe
builtupashort distance from theopposite surface. The tensile stress
may behighenough tocause fracture, andtheplate issaid tohave
scabbed. From studying^ thethickness ofthescabs itispossible to
arrive atvalues foracritical normal fracture stress.

RESIDUAL STRESSES
15-1 .Origin ofResidual Stresses
Residual stresses arethesystem ofstresses which canexist inabody
when itisfreefrom external forces. They aresometimes referred toas
internal stresses, orlocked-in stresses. Residual stresses areproduced
whenever abody undergoes nonuniform plastic deformation. Forexam-
ple,consider ametal sheet which isbeing rolled under conditions such
that plastic flowoccurs onlynearthesurfaces ofthesheet (Fig. 15-la).
(a) id)
Fig.15-1. (a)Inhomogeneous deformation inrolling ofsheet; (6)resulting distribu-
tion oflongitudinal residual stress over thickness ofsheet (schematic).
The surface fibers ofthesheet arecold-worked andtend toelongate,
while thecenter ofthesheet isunchanged. Since thesheetmust remain
acontinuous whole, thesurface andcenter ofthesheetmust undergo a
strain accommodation. Thecenter fibers tend torestrain thesurface
fibers from elongating, while thesurface fibers seektostretch thecentral
fibers ofthesheet The result isaresidual-stress pattern in.thesheet

which consists ofahighcompressive stress atthesurface andatensile
residual stress atthecenter ofthesheet (Fig. 15-16). Ingeneral, the
sign oftheresidual stress which isproduced byinhomogeneous defor-
mation willbeopposite tothesign oftheplastic strain which produced
theresidual stress. Thus, forthecase oftherolled sheet, thesurface
fibers which were elongated inthelongitudinal direction byrolling are
leftinastate ofcompressive residual stress when theexternal load is
removed.
The residual-stress system existing inabodymust beinstatic equi-
librium. Thus, thetotal force acting onanyplane through thebody
andthetotalmoment offorces onanyplane must bezero. Forthe
longitudinal stress pattern inFig. 15-16 thismeans thattheareaunder
thecurve subjected tocompressive residual stresses must balance the
areasubjected totensile residual stresses. Thesituation isnotquite so
simple asispictured inFig. 15-1. Actually, foracomplete analysis, the
residual stresses acting across thewidth andthickness ofthesheet should
beconsidered, andthestate ofresidual stress atanypoint isacombined
stress derived from theresidual stresses inthethree principal directions.
Frequently, because ofsymmetry, only theresidual stress inonedirec-
tionneedbeconsidered. Acomplete determination ofthestate ofresid-
ualstress inthree dimensions isavery considerable undertaking.
Residual stresses aretobeconsidered asonly elastic stresses. The
maximum value which theresidual stress canreach istheelastic limit
ofthematerial. Astress inexcess ofthisvalue, withnoexternal force
tooppose it,willrelieve itselfbyplastic deformation until itreaches the
value oftheyield stress.
Itisimportant todistinguish between macro residual stresses and
microstresses. Macro residual stresses, withwhich thischapter ispri-
marily concerned, vary continuously through thevolume ofthebody
andactover regions which arelargecompared withatomic dimensions.
Microstresses, ortextural stresses, actoverdimensions assmall asseveral
unit cells, although their effectsmayextend throughout most ofagrain.
Because oftheanisotropy oftheelastic properties ofcrystals, micro-
stresses willvary greatly from grain tograin. Theback stress developed
byapile-up ofdislocations isanexample ofthistype ofresidual stress.
Another example istheprecipitation ofsecond-phase particles from solid
"solution. Iftheprecipitate particles occupy alarger volume than the
;omponents fromwhich they formed, i.e., ifthesecond-phase particles
have alower density than thematrix, then each particle int'^ying to
occupy alarger volume iscompressed bythematrix. This, inturn,
develops tensile stresses inthematrix indirections radial andtangential
tothesecond-phase particles. Theexperimental determination ofthese
localized stresses intwo-phase systems isvery difficult, although measure-

ments oftheir average value have beenmade withXrays.''^ Calcu-
lations ofthemicrostresses existing intwo-phase systems havebeenmade
byLazlo/ who usestheterminology "tessellated stresses" forthistype
ofresidual stress. Thedetermination ofthemicrostresses which exist in
plastically deformed single-phase metals isnecessary foranunderstand-
ingofthemechanism ofstrain hardening. Estimates ofthese micro-
stresses canbemade from detailed analysis ofthebroadening ofX-ray
diffraction lines. Further improvements onthetechniques areneeded
before these measurements canbeusedwithout ambiguity.
Residual stresses arisefromnonuniform plastic deformation ofabody.
The principal methods bywhich thiscanoccur arebyinhomogeneous
changes involume and inshape. Athird source ofresidual stressmay
exist inbuilt-up assemblies, such aswelded structures. Even though
thestructure isnotsubjected toexternal loads, different members ofthe
structure maybeunder stress duetovarious interactions between the
members oftheassembly. Thistype ofresidual stress iscalled reaction
stress. Because itfalls inthearea ofstructural engineering, itwillnot
beconsidered further inthischapter.
The precipitation ofsecond-phase particles inametal matrix isan
example ofanonuniform volume change which produces very localized
micro residual stresses. However, ifthereaction does notproceed uni-
formly over thecross section ofthebody because ofdifferences ineither
chemical composition orrate ofheat transfer, there willbeavariation
inthedistribution ofmicrostresses which willproduce macro residual
stresses. Nitriding andcarburizing areprocesses inwhich amicrostress
distribution isproduced around each nitride orcarbide particle, but
because these diffusion-controlled reactions occur onlyonthesurface,
there isanonuniform volume increase inthis region. Thus, amacro
compressive residual stress isproduced onthesurface, and this isbal-
anced bytensile residual stresses intheinterior. Thephase transfor-
mation from austenite tomartensite which occurs during thequenching
ofsteel isanoutstanding example ofanonuniform volume change lead-
ingtohigh residual stresses. Because ofthetechnological importance
ofthissituation, itwillbeconsidered inaseparate section ofthischapter.
Volume changes need notnecessarily involve rapid quenching orphase
changes toproduce residual stresses. Inthecooling ofalarge, hotingot
ofametal w^hich shows nophase change, thetemperature differences
which arepresent between thesurface andthecentermaybeenough to

develop residual stresses.^ Theedges ofahotslab cool faster than the
center. Thethermal contraction ofthecooler edges produces astrain
mismatch between theedges andcenter oftheingot which results inthe
distribution oflongitudinal stresses shown inFig. 15-26. Since thehot
center hasalower yield stress, itcannot support thecompressive stress
imposed onthat region andbecause ofplastic deformation thecenter of
theingot shrinks torelieve some ofthestress (Fig. 15-2c). When the
center oftheslab finally cools, thetotal contraction willbegreater for
thecenter than theedges because thecenter contracts owing toboth
cooling and plastic deformation (Fig. l5-2d). Thecenter willthen be
stressed inresidual tension, andtheedges willbeincompression.

Theforming operations required toconvert metals tofinished and
semifinished shapes rarely produce homogeneous deformation ofthe
metal. Each particular plastic forming process hasaresidual-stress
distribution which ischaracteristic oftheprocess and isinfluenced toa
certain extent bytheway inwhich theprocess hasbeen carried out.
Earlier inthissection wehave seenhowtheresidual stress intherolling
direction ofasheet results frominhomogeneous deformation through the
thickness ofthesheet.
Other metalworking operations which arenotgenerally classed as
metal-forming processes canproduce residual stresses because they
involve inhomogeneous deformation. Spot welding andbutt welding
bothproduce high tensile stresses atthecenter ofthearea ofapplication
ofheat. Shot peening, surface hammering, andsurface rolling produce
shallow biaxial compressive stresses onasurface which arebalanced by
biaxial tension stresses intheinterior. Aswasnoted inChap. 12,shot
peening isaneffective method ofreducing fatigue failures. Residual

stresses aredeveloped inelectroplated coatings. Soft coatings such as
lead,cadmium, andzinccreep sufficiently atroom temperature torelieve
most oftfiese plating stresses. Hard coatings likechromium andnickel
canhave either high tensile orcompressive residual stresses, depending
upon theconditions oftheplating process.
Thesuperposition ofseveral deformation operations doesnotproduce
afinal residual-stress distribution which isthealgebraic sum ofthestress
distributions produced bythepreceding operations. Ingeneral, thefinal
deformation process determines theresulting residual-stress pattern.
However, superposition ofstress distributions isavalid procedure when
one isconsidering theeffect ofresidual stress ontheresponse ofabody
toanexternal stress system. For allpractical purposes residual stresses
canbeconsidered thesame asordinary applied stresses. Thus, acom-
pressive residual stress willreduce theeffectiveness ofanapplied tensile
stress inproducing fatigue failure, and residual tensile stresses will
increase theeasewithwhich failure occurs.
15-2. Effects ofResidual Stresses
Thepresence ofresidual stresses caninfluence thereaction ofamate-
rialtoexternally applied stresses. Inthetension test, that region ofa
specimen containing high residual tensile stresses willyield plastically at
alower value ofapplied stress than aspecimen without residual stresses.
Conversely, compressive residual stresses willincrease theyield stress.
This fact isused tostrengthen guntubes andpressure vessels bythe
process known asautofrettage. Inautofrettage thick-walled cylinders are
purposely strained beyond theelastic limit ofthematerial atthebore of
thecylinder sothat thisregion willcontain compressive residual stresses
when thecylinder isunloaded. Inarelatively brittle material likehigh-
strength steel thepresence oftensile residual stresses cancause adecrease
inthefracture strength. The possibility ofunknown residual stresses
existing attheroot ofmachined notches isaproblem innotch tensile
testing. The effect ofresidual stresses onfatigue performance isawell-
recognized phenomenon andwasconsidered inSec. 12-9.
Residual stresses areresponsible forwarping anddimensional insta-
bility. Ifpart ofabody containing residual stresses ismachined away,
asinmachining alongkeyway inacold-drawn bar,theresidual stresses
inthematerial removed arealsoeliminated. This upsets thestatic equi-
librium ofinternal forces andmoments, andthebody distorts toestablish
anewequilibrium condition. Warping duetoredistribution ofresidual
stresses when surface layers areremoved canbeexceedingly troublesome,
particularly with precision parts liketoolsand dies. However, there is
auseful aspect tothis, foraswillbeseen inthenext section, themeasure-

398 Applications toMaterials Testing [Chap. 15
ment ofdimensional changes when material isremoved from abody is
oneoftheestablished methods formeasuring residual stresses. Dimen-
sional instability refers tochanges indimensions which occur without
anyremoval ofmaterial. These changes result from thedeformation
required tomaintain equilibrium when theresidual-stress distribution
changes from stress relaxation onlong-time room-temperature aging.
The residual-stress pattern insteelsmay alsobealtered bythetransfor-
mation ofretained austenite tomartensite onaging.
Stress corrosion cracking^ isatype offailure which occurs when cer-
tainmetals aresubjected tostress inspecific chemical enviroments.
Residual stress isjustaseffective asstress duetoanexternally applied
load inproducing stress corrosion cracking. Examples ofcombinations
which produce stress corrosion cracking aremercury orammonia com-
pounds with brass (season cracking) andchlorides with austenitic stain-
less steels andcertain age-hardenable aluminum alloys. Extreme care
should betaken tominimize residual stress when these situations are
likely tobeencountered. Infact, accelerated stress corrosion cracking
maybeused asaqualitative testtoindicate thepresence ofresidual
stresses. Typical solutions which areused forthispurpose arelisted
below:
1.Brass-mercurous nitrate inwater; standardized fordetection of
residual stress inbrass cartridge cases(ASTM B154)
2.Austenitic stainless steel-boiling solution of10percentH2SO4 and
10percentCUSO4, orboiling MgCl2
3.Mild steel-boiling NaOH
4.Aluminum-NaCl solution
5.Magnesium-potassium chromate solution
15-3.Mechanical Methods forResidual-stress Measurement
Residual stresses cannot bedetermined directly from strain-gage
measurements, asisthecase forstresses duetoexternally applied loads.
Rather, residual stresses arecalculated from themeasurements ofstrain
that areobtained when thebody issectioned andthelocked-in residual
stresses arereleased.
Themethod developed byBauer andHeyn- formeasuring thelongi-
tudinal residual stresses inacylinder isagood illustration ofthetech-
niques involved. Theresidual stresses inthecylinder canbelikened to
asystem ofsprings (Fig. 15-3). Inthisexample thecylindrical bar is
assumed tocontain tensile residual stresses around theperiphery and

springs would becompressed andtheouter springs elongated (Fig. 15-.3a).
Now, ifthestatic equilibrium offorces isupset byremoving theouter

15-5.X-ray Determination ofResidual Stress
Themeasurement ofresidual stress withXrays utilizes theinteratomic
spacing ofcertain lattice planes asthegage length formeasuring strain.
Inessence, theinteratomic spacing foragiven lattice plane isdetermined
forthestress-free condition andforthesame material containing residual
stress. Thechange inlattice spacing canberelated toresidual stress.
BecauseXrayspenetrate lessthan 0.001 in.intothesurface ofametal,
X-ray methods measure only surface strains andtherefore only surface
residual stresses canbedetermined. Since nostress exists normal toa
freesurface, thismethod islimited touniaxial andbiaxial states ofstress.
Formany applications, particularly where fatigue failure isinvolved, this
isnotaserious disadvantage.
X-ray methods have theimportant advantage that they arenon-
destructive andinvolve nocutting orslitting oftheobject tomeasure
thestresses. Further, itisnotalways necessary tomake measurements
onthespecimen intheunstressed condition. This isoften anadvantage
inmaking post-mortem examinations ofparts which failed inservice.
TheX-ray method measures theresidual stress inavery localized area,^
since theX-ray beam covers anareaapproximately 3^in.indiameter.
Thismakes theX-ray technique useful formeasurements ofsharply
changing stress gradients, but itmaybeadisadvantage where theobjec-
tive istocharacterize theover-all residual-stress condition inasurface.
Since theX-ray method isbased essentially onanaccurate measurement
oftheshift inposition oftheX-ray reflection from agiven setoflattice
planes duetothepresence ofelastic strain, itisnecessary that thedif-
fraction linesbeaccurately located. Using filmtechniques torecord the
X-ray reflections requires that thespecimen yield sharp diffraction lines
ifthelattice strain istobemeasured with precision. Since severely
cold-worked material andquenched andtempered steel givebroad dif-
fraction lines, theresidual stresses inthese important classes ofspecimens
cannot beaccurately determined byX-ray filmtechniques. However,

constants vary considerably with crystallographic direction. Since the
residual stresses calculated from Eq.(15-26) arebased onX-ray measure-
ments oflattice strain incertain fixed directions inthecrystal lattice,
itisquestionable thataverage values ofEand vdetermined from the
tension testshould apply. Experimental dataonthispoint aresome-
what contradictory. Most investigators whohave usedX-ray methods
forresidual-stress determination have considered that theuseofthe
average value ofEand vintroduce noserious errors beyond thatdueto
uncontrollable factors. Forgreatest accuracy, these constants should be
determined foreach material andexperimental setup bymaking X-ray
measurements onstress-relieved specimens which aresubjected toknown
\loads.
15-6.Quenching Stresses
Intheintroductory discussion ofresidual stresses inSec. 15-1 itwas
shown that cooling aningot ofametal which doesnotexperience aphase
change canproduce residual stresses because ofthestrain mismatch pro-
duced bythedifferential contraction between thecooler andhotter parts
ofthebody. Thedevelopment ofthelongitudinal residual-stress pattern
wasshown inFig. 15-2. Quenching abody from ahightemperature
toalower temperature accentuates thedevelopment ofresidual stresses
because thegreater temperature differential which isproduced between
thesurface andthecenter duetotherapid rate ofcooling produces a
greater mismatch ofstrain. Thesituation ofgreatest practical interest
involves theresidual stresses developed during thequenching ofsteel for
hardening. However, forthiscasetheresidual-stress pattern isdueto
thermal volume changes plusvolume changes resulting from thetrans-
formation ofaustenite tomartensite. Thesimpler situation, where the
stresses aredueonly tothermal volume changes, willbeconsidered first.
This isthesituation encountered inthequenching ofametal which does
notundergo aphase change oncooling. Itisalsothesituation encoun-
teredwhen steel isquenched from atempering temperature below the
AIcritical temperature.
Thedistribution ofresidual stress overthediameter ofaquenched bar
inthelongitudinal, tangential, andradial directions isshown inFig.15-9a
fortheusual case ofametal which contracts oncooling. Figure 15-9c
shows that theopposite residual-stress distribution isobtained ifthe
metal expands oncooling. Thedevelopment ofthestress pattern shown
inFig.15-9a canbevisualized asfollows: The relatively coolsurface of
thebartends tocontract intoaringthat isboth shorter andsmaller in

pendently oftheouter ring, itwould change dimensions toashorter and
thinner cylinder oncooling. However, continuity must bemaintained
throughout thebarsothattheouter ring isdrawn in(compressed) inthe
longitudinal, tangential, and radial directions atthesame time asthe
inner core isextended inthesame directions. The stress pattern given

Themagnitude oftheresidual stresses produced byquenching depends
onthestress-strain relationships forthemetal andthedegree ofstrain
mismatch produced bythequenching operation. Foragiven strain mis-
match, thehigher themodulus elasticity ofthemetal, thehigher the
residual stress. Further, since theresidual stress cannot exceed theyield
stress, thehigher theyield stress, thehigher thepossible residual stress.
Theyield-stress-temperature curve forthemetal isalsoimportant. If
theyield stress decreases rapidly with increasing temperature, then the
strain mismatch willbesmall athightemperature because themetal can
accommodate tothermally produced volume changes byplastic flow.
Ontheother hand, metals which have ahigh yield strength atelevated
temperatures, likesuperalloys, willdevelop large residual stresses from
quenching.

Sec. 15-6] Residual Stresses 413
Thefollowing combination ofphysical properties willlead tohighmis-
match strains onquenching:
1.Alowthermal conductivity k
2.Ahigh specific heat c
3.Ahigh coefficient ofthermal expansion, a
4.Ahigh density p
These factors canbecombined intothethermal diffusivity, Dt=k/pc.
Low values ofthermal diffusivity lead tohigh strain mismatch. Other
factors which produce anincrease inthetemperature difference between
thesurface andcenter ofthebarpromote highquenching stresses. These
factors are (1)alarge diameter ofthecylinder, (2)alarge temperature
difference between the initial temperature andthetemperature ofthe
quenching bath,and (3)ahigh severity ofquench.
Inthequenching ofsteels, austenite begins totransform tomartensite
whenever thelocaltemperature ofthebarreaches theMstemperature.
Since anincrease involume accompanies thistransformation, themetal
expands asthemartensite reaction proceeds oncooling from theMsto
Mftemperature. Thisproduces aresidual stress distribution ofthetype
shown inFig. 15-9c. Theresidual-stress distribution inaquenched steel
bar istheresultant ofthecompeting processes ofthermal contraction
andvolume expansion duetomartensite formation. Transformation of
austenite tobainite orpearlite alsoproduces avolume expansion, butof
lesser magnitude. Theresulting stress pattern depends upon thetrans-
formation characteristics ofthesteel, asdetermined chiefly byitscom-
position andhardenability, andtheheat-transfer characteristics ofthe
system, asdetermined primarily bythebardiameter, theaustenitizing
temperature, andtheseverity ofthequench.
Figure 15-10 illustrates some ofthepossible residual-stress patterns
which canbeproduced byquenching steel bars. The leftside ofthis
figure illustrates atypical isothermal transformation diagram forthe
decomposition ofaustenite. Thecooling rates oftheoutside, midradius,
andcenter ofthebarareindicated onthisdiagram bythecurves marked
0,m,and c.InFig. 15-10athequenching ratewasrapid enough to
convert theentire bartomartensite. Bythetime thecenter ofthebar
reached theMstemperature, thetransformation hadbeen essentially
completed atthesurface. The surface layers tried tocontract against
theexpanding central core,andtheresult istensile residual stresses at
thesurface andcompressive stresses atthecenter ofthebar(Fig. 15-106).
However, ifthebardiameter israther small and ithasbeen drastically

stress pattern with tensile stresses atthesurface andcenter ofthebar
andcompressive stresses atmidradius.
Inrelatively brittle materials liketool steels, theyield stress isnotfar
below thefracture stress. Surface tensile stresses equal totheyield stress
maybeproduced byquenching. Ifstress raisers arepresent, theresidual
tensile stressmayexceed thefracture stress. Cracks produced bytensile
quenching stresses arecalled quench cracks. Inorder tominimize quench
cracking inbrittle steels, aninterrupted quench, ormartempering, pro-
cedure issometimes used. The steel isquenched from theaustenitizing
temperature intoaholding bathwhich ismaintained atatemperature
above theMstemperature ofthe steel. The steel iskept atthetem-
perature longenough for ittocome tothermal equilibrium, andthen itis
quenched toalower temperature toform martensite.
Thereasons fortempering hardened steel aretorelieve thehighmicro-
stresses inthemartensite andtoreduce thelevel ofmacro residual stress.
Although tempering generally lowers thelevel ofresidual stress, there are
exceptions tothisbehavior.^ For steel barswhich have beenhardened
through, thelevel ofresidual stress willdecrease uniformly with increas-
ingtempering temperature. Forabarwith surface compressive stresses
duetoincomplete hardening anincrease intempering temperature will
progressively reduce theresidual stress. Ifabar isalmost completely
hardened through, greater contraction duetotempering ofthemartensite
willoccur atthesurface than atthecenter. This willcause thesurface
tensile stress toincrease astempering progresses.
15-7. Surface Residual Stresses
There areanumber ofimportant technological processes which pro-
duce high surface residual stresses which have theirmaximum tvalue
either atthesurface orjustbelow thesurface andwhich falloffrapidly
with distance infrom thesurface. Thesteep stress gradient produced
bythese processes isincontrast with themore uniform residual-stress
gradient produced byquenching andmostmechanical forming operations.
Normally, these processes produce high surface compressive residual
stresses which aidinpreventing fatigue failure. Figure 15-11 istypical
ofthekind ofresidual-stress distribution which isconsidered inthis
section.
Theprocess ofinduction hardening consists ininductively heating a
thin surface layer ofasteel partabove thetransformation temperature
andthen flash-quenching thisregion tomartensite with aspray ofwater.
Thelocalized expansion ofthemartensitic caseproduces aresidual-stress
pattern ofcompression stresses atthesurface andtension intheinterior

distributionTypical residual-stress
produced bysurface
treatment likeinduction hardening,
carburizing, orshotpeening.Flame hardening produces thesame metallurgical changes andresidual-
stress pattern asinduction hardening, butthelocal heating isproduced
byagasflame. Both processes notonlyproduce afavorable residual-
stress pattern but also leave ahardened surface which improves the
resistance towear.
Carburizing consists inchanging the
carbon content ofthesurface layers
ofasteel partbythe diffusion of
carbon atoms into thesurface. The
process differs from induction hard-
ening inthat theentire part isheated
into theaustenite region during the
diffusion process andwhen thepart is
quenched volume changes may occur
through most ofthecross section. In
general, thecarburized surface contains
compressive residual stresses, butcon-
siderable variation inresidual-stress
distribution canbeproduced bychanges
inprocessing.1Ordinarily, themaxi-
mum compressive residual stress occurs atadepth infrom thesurface which
isjustshort oftheboundary between thecarburized caseandthelower-
carbon-content core. Nitriding consists inthediffusion ofnitrogen into
asteel surface atatemperature below the-41transformation temperature.
Theonlyvolume expansion arises from theformation ofnitrides atthe
surface. The residual-stress pattern consists ofcompression atthesur-
faceandtension attheinterior. Because there isnovolume expansion
occurring inthecore, asispossible forcarburizing, theresidual-stress
distribution produced bynitriding iseasier tocontrol.
Shotpeening consists insubjecting ametal surface totheimpact ofa
stream offinemetallic particles (shot). Theimpact oftheshotonthe
surface causes plastic stretching ofthesurface fibers atamultitude of
localized regions. When thislocalized plastic flow isrelieved, itleaves
thesurface inastate ofcompressive residual stress. Intheshotpeening
ofheat-treated steel themaximum compressive residual stress which is
produced isabout 60percent oftheyield strength ofthe steel. The
maximum residual stress occurs below thesurface atadepth ofabout
0.002 to0.010 in.Higher values ofcompressive residual stresses canbe
obtained bystrain peening. Forexample, ifaflatleafspring ispreloaded
inbending, theresulting compressive residual stress onthesurface which
wasprestressed intension willbegreater than ifthesteelwasshot-peened
inaninitially stress-free condition. Thevariables oftheshot-peening

process''^ which mfluence themagnitude anddistribution oftheresidual
stresses are(1)theshot size, (2)theshothardness, (3)theshot velocity,
and (4)theexposure time (coverage).
High surface compressive residual stress canalsobedeveloped bysur-
face rolling, aswasshown inFig. 15-1. Anestimate oftheloads required
forrolling toagiven depthmaybemadebytheuseofHertz's theory of
contact stresses.^
Surface rolling iswelladapted tothebeneficial protection ofcritical
areas like filletsandscrew threads oflarge parts, while shotpeening lends
itself tohigh-production volume parts where broad orirregular surfaces
aretobetreated. Numerous instances havebeen reported intheliter-
ature where theintroduction ofbeneficial compressive residual stresses
byflame hardening,'' carburizing,^ nitriding,^ shot peening,^ andsurface
rolling^ hasresulted inimproved fatigue performance. Surface working
operations such asshotpeening and rolling have alsobeen successfully
used tomitigate theeffects ofstress corrosion cracking.
15-8. Stress Relief
Theremoval orreduction intheintensity ofresidual stress isknown as
stress relief. Stress reliefmay beaccomplished either byheating orby
mechanical working operations. Although residual stresses willslowly
disappear atroom temperature, theprocess isvery greatly accelerated
byheating toanelevated temperature. The stress relief which comes
from astress-relief anneal isduetotwo effects. First, since theresidual
stress cannot exceed theyield stress, plastic flow willreduce theresidual
stress tothevalue oftheyield stress atthestress-relief temperature.
Only theresidual stress inexcess oftheyield stress atthestress-relief
temperature canbeeliminated byimmediate plastic flow. Generally,
most oftheresidual stress willberelieved bytime-dependent stress relax-
ation. Relaxation curves such asthose ofFig.13-15 areuseful foresti-
mating stress-relief treatments. Since thisprocess isextremely temper-

ature-dependent, thetime fornearly complete elimination ofstress canbe
greatly reduced byincreasing thetemperature.^ Often acompromise
must bemade between theuseofatemperature highenough forthe
relief ofstress inareasonable length oftimeandtheannealing ofthe
effects ofcoldwork.
The differential strains thatproduce high residual stresses alsocanbe
eliminated byplastic deformation atroom temperature. Forexample,
products such assheet, plate, andextrusions areoften stretched several
percentbeyond theyield stress torelieve differential strains byyielding.
Inother cases theresidual-stress distribution which ischaracteristic ofa
particular working operation maybesuperimposed ontheresidual-stress
pattern initially present inthematerial. Asurface which contains tensile
residual stresses mayhave thestress distribution converted intobeneficial
compressive stresses with asurface working process likerolling orshot
peening. However, itisimportant inusing thismethod ofstress relief
toselect surface working conditions which willcompletely cancel the
initial stress distribution. Forexample, itisconceivable that, ifonly
very light surface rolling wereusedonasurface which initially contained
tensile stresses, onlythetensile stresses atthesurface would bereduced.
Dangerously high tensile stresses could stillexistbelow thesurface.
Aninteresting concept istheuseofthermal stresses toreduce quench^
ingstresses. Since residual stresses result from thermal gradients pro-
duced when apart isbeing quenched, itispossible tointroduce residual
stresses ofopposite signbysubjecting acoldpiece tovery rapid heating.
This concept ofan"uphill quench" hasbeen used^ inaluminum alloys
toreduce quenching stresses byasmuch as80percent attemperatures

STATISTICS APPLIED TO
MATERIALS TESTING
16-1.Why Statistics?
There areatleast three reasons whyaworking knowledge ofstatistics
isneeded inmechanical metallurgy. First, mechanical properties, being
structure-sensitive properties, frequently exhibit considerable variability,
orscatter. Therefore, statistical techniques areuseful, andoften even
necessary, fordetermining theprecision ofthemeasurements and for
drawing valid conclusions from thedata. The statistical methods which
apply inmechanical metallurgy areingeneral nodifferent from thetech-
niques which areused foranalysis ofdata inother areas ofengineering
and science. Mechanical metallurgy isoneofthefewareas ofmetal-
lurgy where largenumbers ofdata arelikely tobeencountered, andthere-
fore itisalogical place inwhich tointroduce theelements ofstatistical
analysis ofdata tometallurgists whomayhavehadnoother training in
thesubject. Asecond reason forconsidering statistics inconjunction
with mechanical metallurgy isthat statistical methods can assist in
designing experiments togivethemaximum amount ofinformation with
theminimum ofexperimental investigation. Finally, statistical methods
based onprobability theory havebeendeveloped toexplain certain prob-
lems inmechanical metallurgy. Theexplanation ofthe size effect in
brittle fracture andfatigue isagoodexample oftheuseofstatistical
theory inmechanical metallurgy.
Itisrecognized that thematerial which canbeincluded inasingle
chapter canhardly consist ofmore thananintroduction tothissubject.
Inorder tocover thegreatest amount ofground, noattempt hasbeen
made toinclude themathematical niceties which areusually apart of
acourse instatistics. Instead, emphasis hasbeen placed onshowing
how statistics canbeputtowork. Numerous references areincluded to
sources ofmore complete discussions andtotechniques andapplications

which could notbeincluded because ofspace limitations. Itishoped
that thischapter contributes toabetter appreciation oftheusefulness of
statistics inmetallurgical research byproviding thebackground neces-
sary toseeaproblem from astatistical viewpoint andenough ofthe
standard tools ofstatistics toallow avalid analysis instraightforward
applications. Itisimportant toemphasize thatmany practical prob-
lems arejusttoocomplicated totreatbymeans ofthesimpler statistical
techniques. Inthese cases itisimportant toacquire theservices ofa
trained statistician fortheplanning oftheexperiment andtheanalysis
ofthedata.
16-2. Errors andSamples
Theactofmaking anytype ofexperimental observation involves two
types oferrors, systematic errors (which exert anonrandom bias), and
experimental, orrandom, errors. Systematic errors arise because of
faulty control oftheexperiment. Experimental, orrandom, errors are
duetolimitations ofthemeasuring equipment ortoinherent variability
inthematerial being tested. Asanexample, inthemeasurement ofthe
reduction ofarea ofafractured tensile specimen, asystematic error could
beintroduced ifanimproperly zeroed micrometer wereused formeasur-
ingthediameter, whilerandom errors would result from slight differences
infitting together thetwohalves ofthetensile specimen andfrom the
inherent variability ofreduction-of-area measurements onmetals. By
averaging anumber ofobservations therandom error willtend tocancel
out.Thesystematic error, however, willnotcancel upon averaging.
One ofthemajor objectives ofstatistical analysis istodealquantitatively
withrandom error.
When atensile specimen iscutfrom asteel forging andthereduction
ofarea isdetermined forthisspecimen, theobservation represents asam-
pleofthe"population fromwhich itwasdrawn. Thepopulation, inthis
case, isthecollection ofallpossible tensile specimens which could becut
from thisforging orfrom allother forgings which areexactly identical.
Asmoreandmore tensile specimens arecutfrom theforging andreduc-
tion-of-area values measured, thesample estimate ofthepopulation
values becomes better andbetter. However, itisobviously impractical
tosample and testtheentire forging. Therefore, oneofthemain pur-
poses ofstatistical techniques istodetermine thebest estimate ofthe
population parameters from arandomly selected sample. Theapproach
which istaken istopostulate that foreachsample thepopulation has
fixedandinvariant parameters. However, thecorresponding parameters
calculated fromsamples contain random errors, andtherefore thesample
provides onlyanestimate ofthepopulation parameters. Itisforthis

Sec.16-3] Statistics Applied toMaterials Testing 421
reason that statistical methods lead toconclusions having agiven proba-
hiliiij ofbeing correct.
16-3. Frequency Distribution
When alargenumber ofobservations aremade from arandom sample,
amethod isneeded tocharacterize thedata. Themostcommon method
istoarrange theobservations intoanumber ofequal-valued class intervals
anddetermine thefrequency oftheobservations falling within each class
interval. InTable 16-1, outofatotal sample of449measurements of

measurements (Fig. 16-1). This type ofbardiagram isknown asa
histogram. Asthenumber ofobservations increases, thesizeoftheclass
interval canbereduced untilweobtain thelimiting curve which repre-
sents thefrequency distribution ofthesample (Fig. 16-2). Note thatmost
ofthevalues ofyield strength fallwithin theinterval from 126,000 to
134,000 psi.

itismuch lesssensitive than thefrequency distribution tothechoice of
class intervals.
16-4. Measures ofCentral Tendency andDispersion
Afrequency distribution such asthat ofFig. 16-2canbedescribed
withnumbers which indicate thecentral location ofthedistribution and
howtheobservations arespread outfrom thecentral region (dispersion).
Themostcommon andimportant measure ofthecentral value ofanarray
ofdata isthearithmetic mean, oraverage. Themean ofXi,X2, • • •,
Xnobservations isdenoted byXand isgiven by
XIx.

withmidpoint X,.Thesummation istaken over allclass intervals (see
Table 16-1, column 4).Equation (16-2) isanapproximation toEq.
(16-1).
Two othercommon measures ofcentral tendency arethemodeandthe
median. Themode isthevalue oftheobservations which occurs most
frequently. Themedian isthemiddle value ofagroup ofobservations.
Forasetofdiscrete data themedian canbeobtained byarranging the
observations innumerical sequence anddetermining which value falls in
themiddle. Forafrequency distribution themedian isthevalue which
divides theareaunder thecurve intotwoequal parts. Themean and
themedian arefrequently close together; but ifthere areextreme values
intheobservations (either high orlow), themean willbemore influenced
bythese values than themedian. Asanextreme example, thesituation
sometimes arises infatigue testing thatoutofagroup ofspecimens tested
atacertain stress afewdonot failinthetime allotted forthetestand
therefore theypresumably have infinite lives. These extreme values
could notbegrouped with thefailed specimens tocalculate amean
fatigue life; j^etthey could beconsidered indetermining themedian.
Thepositions ofthemean, median, andmode areindicated inFig. 16-2.
Themost important measure ofthedispersion ofasample isgiven by
thevariance s^.
I(Xi-xy
s'='^(16-3)w—1
Theterm Xi—Xisthedeviation ofeach observation Xifrom the
arithmetic meanXofthenobservations. Thequantity n—1inthe
denominator iscalled thenumber ofdegrees offreedom and isequal to
thenumber ofobservations minus thenumber oflinear relations between
theobservations. Since themean represents onesuch relation, thenum-
ber ofdegrees offreedom forthevariance about themean isn—1.
Forcomputational purposes itisoften convenient tocalculate thevari-
ancefrom thefollowing relation:

When thedata arearranged inafrequency table, thevariance canbe
most readily computed from thefollowing equation:

Indealing with thedispersion ofdata itisusual practice towork with
thestandard deviation s,which isdefined asthepositive square root
ofthevariance.
s=I(X,-xy

Sometimes itisdesirable todescribe thevariability relative tothe
average. The coefficient ofvariation visused forthispurpose.
(16-7)
Ameasure ofdispersion which issometimes usedbecause ofitsextreme
simplicity istherange. Therange issimply thedifference between the
largest andsmallest observation. Therange doesnotprovide asprecise
estimates asdoesthestandard deviation.
16-5. TheNormal Distribution
Many physical measurements follow thesymmetrical, bell-shaped
curve ofthenormal, orGaussian, frequency distribution. Repeated
measurements ofthelength ordiameter ofabarwould closely approxi-
mate thisfrequency distribution. The distributions ofyield strength,
tensile strength, andreduction ofareafrom thetension testhave been
found tofollow thenormal curve toasuitable degree ofapproximation.
Theequation ofthenormal curve is

assigned value X, fxisthemean ofthepopulation, and <yisthestandard

distribution' without destroying itsstatistical usefulness. The central-
limittheorem shows thatanormal frecjuency distribution istobeexpected
when theeffect being observed results from averaging theeffects ofa
whole series ofvariables. However, iftheeffect being observed isdue
tothesmallest orlargest ofanumber ofvariables, anextreme-value distri-
bution istobeexpected. Iffailure isduetooneweakest link ortoa
number ofmore orlessequally weak links, theextreme-value distribution
would apply.
Theapplication oftheextreme-value distribution toengineering prob-
lems hasbeen largely theresult ofthework ofE.J.Gumbel.^ This
theory hasbeenused topredict themaximum wind velocity orthecrest
offloods (largest values) andthefatigue lifefora0.1percentprobability
offailure (smallest value). While themathematical details ofthe
extreme-value theory areoutside thescope ofthischapter, anidea of
theconcept canbeobtained from anexample. Consider agroup of
fatigue specimens tested tofailure ataconstant stress. Thedistribution
offatigue lifeobtained from thissample canbeconsidered tobean
extreme-value distribution ifitisassumed thateach specimen which
failed represents theweakest outofalargenumber ofspecimens tested
tothesame particular number ofcycles ofstress reversal. Methods of
using theextreme-value distribution with fatigue datahave been devel-
oped,^ andextreme-value probability paper isavailable forplotting the
results.
Aspecial type ofextreme-value distribution istheWeibull distri-
bution.^ For thisfrequency distribution, thecumulative-distribution
function isgiven by
(^)P(X)=1-exp-^^-^^ (16-12)
where P(X) istheprobability thatavalue lessthanXwillbeobtained,
Xn isthevalue ofXforwhich P(X)=0,andXoandmareempirically

curve which resembles that foranormal distribution except thatWeibull's

used todescribe theyield-strength distribution ofsteelandthefatigue

lifeatconstant stress. Itappears tobeparticularly well suited to
describing thedistribution offatigue lifeofbearings.^
When amass ofmechanical testdata isanalyzed toselect reliable
design values, thedesign engineer isusually interested inestablishing
thesmallest values oftheproperty being tested, sothatthedesign canbe
based onconservative yetrealistic strength values. Forexample, the
designer might beinterested inknowing thevalue ofyield strength which
would beexceeded by99.9percent ofthespecimens, while themetal-
lurgist who istrying toimprove theyield strength byheattreatment
would bemainly interested inknowing themean andstandard deviation
ofhistestvalues. Ofcourse, thevalue ofyield strength which would be
exceeded by99.9percent ofthespecimens canbecalculated from the
sample observations provided thatthefrequency distribution oftheobser-
vations isknown andtheobservations faithfully follow thisdistribution.
Unfortunately, although most mechanical property data fitanormal or
log-normal frequency distribution over thecentral region ofprobability,
atthetails orextremes ofthedistribution appreciable deviations usually
occur. Amean andstandard deviation canbedetermined fromany set
ofobservations bythemethods described previously, regardless ofthe
nature ofthefrequency distribution, andeven iftheobservations deviate
considerably from anormal distribution, thepowerful statistical tests
described inthenext section can stillbeusedwith relatively little error.
Ontheother hand, estimates oftheprobability offailure arenotvalid
outside theregions inwhich thedata areknown tofitthefrequency
distribution. The prediction ofvalues atlowprobabilities offailure,
e.g.,the0.1percent level, onthebasis oftheassumption thatthedata
follow thenormal distribution inthisregion canlead toconsiderable
error. Further, because ofthelargenumber oftests required tomake
anexperimental determination ofthestress which gives a1or0.1per
cent probability offailure, there arefewexperimental observations in
theextreme regions which canbeused forguidance. While extreme-
value statistics have notyetmetwith universal acceptance, thisapproach
isthemost reasonable indeahng with small probabilities offailure.
16-7. Tests ofSignificance
Animportant feature ofstatistical analysis istheability, through tests
ofsignificance, tomake comparisons anddraw conclusions with agreater
assurance ofbeing correct than iftheconclusions hadbeenbased onlyon
intuitive interpretation ofthedata. Most ofthecommon statistical tests
ofsignificance arebased ontheuseofthenormal distribution, sothat it

Sec.16-7] Statistics Applied toMaterials Testing 433
isadistinct advantage ifthetestdataconform tothisfrequency distri-
bution. Acommon problem which isreadily treated bymeans oftests
ofsignificance istodetermine whether themeans and/or standard devi-
ations oftwosamples drawn from essentially thesame population really
differ significantly orwhether theobserved differences areduetorandom
chance. Instatistics theterm significant difference isusedmuch more
precisely than ineveryday usage. Indetermining whether ornottwo
statistics aresignificantly different itisalways necessary tospecify the
probability ofthetestpredicting anerroneous conclusion. This isknown
asthe level ofsignificance. Forexample, ifthetest ofsignificance is
made atthe5percent level ofsignificance there is1chance in20that
anerroneous conclusion would bereached bythetest.
Difference between TwoSam-pie Standard Deviations
Itisoften ofinterest toknow whether ornotthevariability ofoneset
ofmeasurements differs significantly from that ofanother setofdata.
Forexample, itmay beimportant toknow whether ornotacertain
metallurgical condition shows more scatter infatigue lifethan another
treatment orwhether ornotthescatter issignificantly different athigh
stresses andatlow stresses. The test ofsignificance which isused for
thissituation istheFtest.
Let Sibethestandard deviation forasample sizeWifrom the first

Thefollowing ratio isdetermined, where Si^>§2^:

TheFratio obtained from Eci. (16-1.3) iscompared with tables ofthe

which forthiscase isonelessthan thesample size. Thetable isentered
across thetopforthedegrees offreedom forthenumerator intheFratio
andalong theleft-hand edge forthedegrees offreedom forthedenomi-
nator. Where thiscolumn androw intersect, wegetthevalue ofthe
Fratio. Iftheratio calculated inEq.(16-13) isgreater than theFratio
obtained from thetable, thetwo sets ofstandard deviations aresignifi-
cantly different atthechosen level ofsignificance. Note that, asthe
level ofsignificance israised (less riskofmaking anerroneous decision),
thegreater must betheFratiodetermined from Eq.(16-13). Forexam-

Theconfidence interval forthemedian ofapopulation canbeobtained

predicting atvarious levels ofconfidence and fordifferent sample sizes
what values inthearray thepopulation median would beexpected tolie

areconfidence limits ofmore than 95percent forthepopulation median,
while ifn=50,thepopulation median will liebetween theeighteenth

bility ofthevariation ofproperties with position intheforging must be

type ofexperimental design. However, thedisadvantages ofsimple fac-

asfractional replication.^ Thenumber ofruns required issubstantially
reduced without greatly affecting thepower ofthemethod. Themain
sacrifice isinruns which, ifincluded, would provide information on
higher-order interactions between thevariables. The construction of

Theterm regression isused instatistics torefer tothedetermination
ofafunctional relationship between oneormore independent variables
Xiandadependent variable Yi.Regression techniques areordinarily
usedwhere itisassumed that afixed butunknown relationship exists
between theXandYpopulations buttherandom errors inthemeasure-
ments prevent areliable determination oftherelationship byinspection.
Anexample might bethedetermination oftherelationship between
tensile strength (F)andBrinell hardness (.Y). Inthissection only the
simplest case oflinear regression willbeconsidered. This isalso called
themethod ofleast squares because thelinewhich results from theanaly-
sishastheproperty thatthesum ofthesquares ofvertical deviations of
observations from this line issmaller than thecorresponding sum ofthe
squares ofdeviations fromanyother line. Multiple regression, where
there aretwoormore independent variables intheregression equation,
isanextension ofthisanalysis, andcurvilinear regression, where acurved
line isfitted tothedata, isafurther refinement.
Frequently, theterm correlation isused inconjunction with regression.
Aclear distinction should bemade between regression and correlation.
Regression deals with thesituation where there isaclear distinction
between thedependent andindependent variables, while correlation deals
with therelationship between twoormore setsofdatawhich vary jointlj'.

Therefore, thebrittle-fracture strength isdetermined, notbyanaverage
value ofthedistribution ofimperfections, butbytheone,mostdangerous
imperfection. This concept ofbrittle fracture iscalled theweakest-link
concept indirect analogy with thefactthat thestrength ofachain is
determined bythestrength ofitsweakest link. Theexistence ofasize
effect arises quite naturally from thisconcept. Ifthecrack density of
thematerial isassumed constant, asthevolume ofthespecimen increases
thetotalnumber ofcracks alsoincreases andtherefore theprobability of
encountering asevere crack isincreased. Ifthe stress distribution
imposed bythetestmethod isnonuniform, asinbending ortorsion, the
analysis must bebased onthesurface area.
Theproblem ofrelating thecrack distribution tothefracture strength
isoneoffinding thedistribution function ofthesmallest value ofstrength
asafunction ofthenumber ofcracks A''foragiven distribution function
ofcrack sizes. Frequently, thedistribution ofcrack size isassumed to
beGaussian. This implies thattheprobability ofhaving asmall defect
isthesame astheprobability ofoccurrence ofalarge defect. The
mathematics forthiscrack distribution hasbeenworked outbyFrenkel
andKontorova.^ ForaGaussian distribution ofthestrength ofthe

thesize effect intension andbending ofsteel atlowtemperature show
good agreement with WeibuU's prediction.^ Itisalsoargued that a

distribution does notaccurately describe thedistribution offatigue life
attheupper andlower extremes ofthedistribution. Since fatigue life
depends ontheweakest section rather thanonaverage behavior, itis
tobeexpected that theextreme-value distribution function would pro-
vide better agreement inthese regions.
The statistical analysis ofthefatigue data intheregion ofthefatigue
limit requires special techniques which have notyetbeen discussed in
thischapter. Inmaking tests tomeasure thefatigue limit,wecantest
agiven specimen only ataparticular stress, and ifthespecimen fails
before thecutoff limit of10^cycles thenweknow that thefatigue limit
ofthespecimen issomewhere below the stress level which weused.
Consequently, ifthespecimen doesnot fail(arun-out) intheprescribed
number ofcycles, weknow that itsfatigue limit liessomewhere above
thetest stress. Because agiven specimen cannot betested more than
once, even ifit"ran out," itisnecessary toestimate thestatistics ofthe
fatigue limitbytesting alargenumber ofpresumably identical specimens
atdifferent stress levels. Experiments ofthistype areknown assensi-
tivity experiments. Two particular types ofstatistical analysis ofsensi-
tivity experiments have been applied tothestatistical determination of
thefatigue limit. Theprocedures used willbebriefly described below.
Step-by-step procedures fortheanalysis willbefound intheASTM
Manual onstatistical analysis offatigue data.^
The first ofthemethods forthestatistical determination ofthefatigue
limit isknown asprobit analysis. Anumber ofspecimens aretested at
each offour tosixstress levels inthevicinity oftheestimated fatigue
limit. When thepercentage ofthespecimens which survived ateach
stress isplotted onnormal-probability paper against thestress level, a
straight line isobtained. Oneway ofperforming theexperiment isto
test20specimens ateach stress level. The analysis follows thepro-
cedures givenbyFinney inhisbookonprobit analysis.^ Thepercentage
ofsurvivors areconverted toprobit values^ andaregression line isdeter-
mined according toFinney's procedure forweighting thevalues atdiffer-
entpercentages ofsurvival. However, thesame type ofanalysis canbe
made without resorting toanyspecial techniques.
Thenumber ofspecimens tested ateach stress should beapportioned
with regard totheexpected percentage ofsurvival. Notfewer than
5specimens should betested atastress level, andatleast atotal of
50specimens should beused inthedetermination ofthemedian value

GENERAL FUNDAMENTALS
OFMETALWORKING
17-1. ClassiFication ofFormins Processes
Theimportance ofmetals inmodern technology isdue, inlarge part,
totheeasewithwhich theymaybeformed intouseful shapes. Hundreds
ofprocesses have beendeveloped forspecific metalworking applications.
However, these processes maybeclassified intoonly afewcategories on
thebasis ofthetype offorces applied tothework piece asitisformed
intoshape. These categories are:
1.Direct-compression-type processes
2.Indirect-compression processes
3.Tension-type processes
4.Bending processes
5.Shearing processes
Indirect-compression processes theforce isapplied tothesurface
oftheworkpiece, andthemetal flows atright angles tothedirection
ofthecompression. The chief examples ofthistype ofprocess are
forging and rolling (Fig. 17-1). Indirect-compression processes include
wireandtube drawing, extrusion, and thedeep drawing ofacup.
Theprimary applied forces arefrequently tensile, buttheindirect com-
pressive forces developed bythereaction oftheworkpiece with thedie
reach high values. Therefore, themetal flowsunder theaction ofacom-
bined stress statewhich includes highcompressive forces inatleast one
oftheprincipal directions. Thebestexample ofatension-type forming
process isstretch forming, where ametal sheet iswrapped tothecontour
ofadieunder theapplication oftensile forces. Bending involves the
application ofbending moments tothesheet, while shearing involves the
application ofshearing forces ofsufficient magnitude torupture themetal
intheplane ofshear. Figure 17-1 illustrates these processes inavery
simplified way.

Plastic working processes which aredesigned toreduce aningot or
billet toastandard millproduct ofsimple shape, such assheet, plate,
andbar,arecalled primary mechanical working processes. Forming meth-
odswhich produce apart toafinal finished shape arecalled secondary
mechanical working processes. Most sheet-metal forming operations, wire
drawing, andtubedrawing aresecondary processes. Theterminology in
thisarea isnotvery precise. Frequently the firstcategory isreferred to
asprocessing operations, andthesecond iscalled fabrication.
Animportant purpose ofplastic working operations istobreakdown
andrefine thecolumnar ordendritic structure present incastmetals and

Sec. 17-2] General Fundamentals ofMetalworking 455
alloys. Frequently thelowstrength andductility ofcastings aredueto
thepresence ofabrittle constituent atthegrain boundaries anddendritic
boundaries. Bycompressive deformation itisoften possible tofragment
abrittle microconstituent insuch away that theductile matrix flows
intothespaces between fragments andwelds together toleave aper-
fectly sound structure. Once thebrittle constituent isbroken up, its
effect onthemechanical properties isminor andductility andstrength
areincreased. Forging and rolling aretheprocesses ordinarily used for
breaking down acaststructure. However, extrusion isthebestmethod
because thebillet issubjected tocompressive forces only.
17-2. Effect ofTemperature onForming Processes
Forming processes arecommonly classified intohot-working and cold-
working operations. Hotworking isdefined asdeformation under cou'
ditions oftemperature andstrain ratesuch thatrecovery processes take
place simultaneously with thedeformation. Ontheother hand, cold
working isdeformation carried outunder conditions where recovery proc-
esses arenoteffective. Inhotworking thestrain hardening anddistorted
grain structure produced bydeformation arevery rapidly eliminated by
theformation ofnew strain-free grains astheresult ofrecrystallization.
Very large deformations arepossible inhotworking because therecovery
processes keep pace with thedeformation. Hotworking occurs atan
essentially constant flow stress, andbecause theflow stress decreases with
increasing temperature, theenergy required fordeformation isgenerally
much lessforhotworking than forcoldworking. Since strain hardening
isnotrelieved incoldworking, theflow stress increases withdeformation.
Therefore, thetotaldeformation that ispossible without causing fracture
islessforcoldworking than forhotworking, unless theeffects ofcold
work arerelieved byannealing.
Itisimportant torealize thatthedistinction between coldworking and
hotworking doesnotdepend uponanyarbitrary temperature ofdefor-
mation. Formost commercial alloys ahot-working operation must be
carried outatarelatively hightemperature inorder thatarapid rate of
recrystallization beobtained. However, leadandtinrecrystallize rapidly
atroom temperature after large deformations, sothattheworking ofthese
metals atroom temperature constitutes hotworking. Similarly, working
tungsten at2,000°F, inthehot-working range forsteel, constitutes cold
working because thishigh-melting metal hasarecrystallization temper-
ature above thisworking temperature.
HotWorking
Hotworking isthe initial step inthemechanical working ofmost
metals and alloys. Notonly does hotworking result inadecrease in

456 Plastic Forming ofMetals [Chap. 17
theenergy required todeform themetal andanincreased abihty toflow
without cracking, buttherapid diffusion athot-working temperatures
aids indecreasing thechemical inhomogeneities ofthecast-ingot struc-
ture. Blowholes andporosity areeliminated bythewelding together of
these cavities, andthecoarse columnar grains ofthecasting arebroken
down and refined into smaller equiaxed recrystallized grains. These
changes instructure from hotworking result inanincrease inductility
andtoughness overthecast state.
However, there arecertain disadvantages tohotworking. Because
hightemperatures areusually involved, surface reactions between the
metal andthefurnace atmosphere become aproblem. Ordinarily hot
working isdone inair,oxidation results, andaconsiderable amount of
metalmaythusbelost. Reactive metals likemolybdenum areseverely
embrittled byoxygen, andtherefore theymust behot-worked inaninert
atmosphere orprotected from theairbyasuitable container. Surface
decarburization ofhot-worked steel canbeaserious problem, and fre-
quently extensive surface finishing isrequired toremove thedecarburized
layer. Rolled-in oxidemakes itdifficult toproduce good surface finishes
onhot-rolled products, andbecause allowance must bemade forexpan-
sionand contraction, thedimensional tolerances forhot-worked mill
products aregreater than forcold-worked products. Further, thestruc-
tureandproperties ofhot-worked metals aregenerally notsouniform
over thecross section asinmetals which have been cold-worked and
annealed. Since thedeformation isalways greater inthesurface layers,
themetal willhave afiner recrystallized grain sizeinthisregion. Because
theinterior willbeathigher temperatures forlonger times during cooling
than willbetheexternal surfaces, grain growth canoccur intheinterior
oflarge pieces, which coolslowly from theworking temperature.
Thelower temperature limit forthehotworking ofametal isthe
lowest temperature atwhich therate ofrecrystallization israpid enough
toeliminate strain hardening inthetimewhen themetal isattemper-
ature. Foragiven metal oralloy thelower hot-working temperature
willdepend upon such factors astheamount ofdeformation andthetime
when themetal isattemperature. Since thegreater theamount ofdefor-
mation thelower therecrystallization temperature, thelower temperature
limit forhotworking isdecreased forlarge deformations. Metal which
israpidly deformed andcooled rapidly from temperature willrequire a
higher hot-working temperature forthesame degree ofdeformation than
willmetal slowly deformed andslowly cooled.
Theupper limit forhotworking isdetermined bythetemperature at
which either melting orexcessive oxidation occurs. Generally themaxi-
mum working temperature islimited to100°F below themelting point.
This istoallow forthepossibility ofsegregated regions oflower-melting-

17-2] General Fundamentals ofMetalworking 457
point material. Only avery smallamount ofagrain-boundary film of
alower-melting constituent isneeded tomake amaterial crumble into
pieces when itisdeformed. Such acondition isknown ashotshortness,
orburning.
Most hot-working operations arecarried outinanumber ofmultiple
passes, orsteps. Generally theworking temperature fortheintermediate
passes iskept wellabove theminimum working temperature inorder to
takeadvantage oftheeconomies offered bythelower flow stress. Itis
likely thatsome grain growth willoccur subsequent totherecrystalli-
zation atthese temperatures. Since afine-grain-sized product isusually
desired, common practice istolower theworking temperature forthe
lastpass tothepoint where grain growth during cooling from thework-
ingtemperature willbenegligible. This finishing temperature isusually
justabove theminimum recrystallization temperature. Inorder to
ensure afinerecrystallized grain size, theamount ofdeformation inthe
lastpassshould berelatively large.
ColdWorking
Aswasshown inSec. 5-9,coldworking ofametal results inanincrease
instrength orhardness andadecrease inductility. When coldworking
isexcessive, themetal willfracture before reaching thedesired sizeand
shape. Therefore, inorder toavoid such difficulties, cold-working oper-
ations areusually carried outinseveral steps, with intermediate anneal-
ingoperations introduced tosoften thecold-worked metal andrestore the
ductility. Thissequence ofrepeated coldworking andannealing isfre-
quently called thecold-work-anneal cycle. Figure 17-2 schematically
illustrates theproperty changes involved inthis cycle.
Although theneed forannealing operations increases thecost ofform-
ingbycoldworking, particularly forreactive metals which must be
annealed invacuum orinert atmospheres, itprovides adegree ofversa-
tility which isnotpossible inhot-working operations. Bysuitably

adjusting theeold-work anneal cycle thepartcanbeproduced withany
desired degree ofstrain hardening. Ifthefinished product must be
stronger than thefullyannealed material, then thefinaloperation must
beacold-working stepwith theproper degree ofdeformation toproduce
thedesired strength. Thiswould probably befollowed byastress relief
toremove residual stresses. Such aprocedure todevelop acertain
combination ofstrength and ductility inthe finalproduct ismore suc-
cessful than trying toachieve thesame combinations ofproperties by
partially softening afully cold-worked material, because therecrystalli-
zation process proceeds relatively rapidly and isquite sensitive tosmall
temperature fluctuations inthefurnace. Ifitisdesired tohave thefinal
part inthefully softened condition, thenananneal follows thelastcold-
working step.
Itiscustomary toproduce cold-worked products likestripandwire in
different tempers, depending upon thedegree ofcoldreduction following
thelastanneal. Thecold-worked condition isdescribed astheannealed
(soft) temper, quarter-hard, half-hard, three-quarter-hard, full-hard, and
spring temper. Each temper condition indicates adifferent percentage
ofcoldreduction following theannealing treatment.
17-3. Effect ofSpeed ofDeformation onForming Processes
Theresponse ofametal toforming operations canbeinfluenced bythe
ispeed withwhich itisdeformed. Theexistence ofatransition from a
ductile tobrittle condition formost body-centered cubic metals over a
certain temperature range hasalready been discussed inearlier chapters.
This transition-temperature phenomenon ismore pronounced forrapid
rates ofdeformation. Thus, forcertain metals theremaybeatemper-
ature region below which themetal willshatter when subjected toahigh-
speed orimpact load. Forexample, ironand steel willcrack ifhammered
attemperatures wellbelow room temperature, whereas alimited amount
ofslow-speed deformation canbeaccomplished inthesame temperature
range.
Table 17-1 liststypical values ofvelocities fordifferent types oftesting
andforming operations. Itisimportant tonotethattheforming veloc-
ityofmost commercial equipment isappreciably faster than thecross-
head velocity used inthestandard tension test. Therefore, values of
flow stress measured inthetension testarenotdirectly applicable for
thecomputation offorming loads. Forcoldworking achange inthe
forming speed ofseveral orders ofmagnitude results inonlyabout a
20percent increase intheflow curve, sothat forpractical purposes the

Theflow stress forhotworking isquitemarkedly affected bythespeed
ofdeformation. There arenoroutine methods formeasuring theflow
stress during hotworking. However, ahigh-speed compression testing
machine, called thecamplastometer, isonedevice which hasgiven good
results. Data obtained^ forcopper, aluminum, andmild steel ataseries
ofconstant temperatures indicate that thedependence offlow stress on
strain rateover arange ofefrom 1to40sec~' canbeexpressed byEq.
(9-35). Because thetime attemperature isshorter forhighforming
speeds, theminimum recrystallization temperature israised andthe
minimum hot-working temperature willbehigher. Ontheother hand,
because themetal retains theheatdeveloped bydeformation toagreater
extent athighforming speeds, there isagreater danger ofhotshortness.
Formetals which have arather narrow hot-working range these opposing
effects serve toclose thegap stillfurther andmake itimpractical to
carry outhotworking atveryhighforming speeds.
Arecent development hasbeen theultrahigh-velocity forming ofmetals
atvelocities of100to400 ft/secbyusing theenergy generated bythe
detonation ofexplosives.^ Among theadvantages offered arethefact
that high-strength materials canbeformed without large springback,
thatmetals flow readily intotherecesses ofthe die,andthat certain
shapes canbeproduced which cannot bemade byanyother technique.

totheflow stress ofthemetal being worked. This, inturn, depends on

themetallurgical structure andcomposition ofthe alloy. Forpure
metals theease ofmechanical working will, ingeneral, decrease with
increasing melting point ofthemetal. Since theminimum recrystalli-
zation temperature isapproximately proportional tothemelting point,
thelower temperature limit forhotwork willalsoincrease withmelting
point. (Asarough approximation, thistemperature isabout one-half
themelting point.) Theaddition ofalloying elements toform asolid-
solution alloy generally raises theflow curve, andtheforming loads
increase proportionately. Since themelting point isoften decreased by
solid-solution alloying additions, theupper hot-working temperature
must usually bereduced inorder toprevent hotshortness.
The plastic working characteristics oftwo-phase (heterogeneous) alloys
depend onthemicroscopic distribution ofthesecond-phase particles.
Thepresence ofalarge volume fraction ofhard uniformly dispersed
particles, such asarefound intheSAP class ofhigh-temperature alloys,
greatly increases theflow stress andmakes working quite difficult. If
thesecond-phase particles aresoft,theyhave onlyasmall effect onthe
working characteristics. Ifthese particles have alower melting point
than thematrix, then difficulties withhotshortness willbeencountered.
Thepresence ofamassive, uniformly distributed microconstituent, such
aspearlite inmild steel, results inlessincrease inflow stress than for
very finely divided second-phase particles. Theshape ofthecarbide
particles canbeimportant incold-working processes. Forannealed steel,
aspheroidization heattreatment, which converts thecementite platelets
tospheroidal cementite particles, isoften used toincrease theformability
atroom temperature. Animportant exception tothegeneral rulethat
thepresence ofahard second phase increases thedifficulty offorming is
brass alloys containing 35to45percent zinc(Muntz metal). These
alloys, which consist ofarelatively hard betaphase inanalpha-brass
matrix, actually have lower flow stresses inthehot-working region than
thesingle-phase alpha-brass alloys. Inthecold-working region theflow
stress ofalpha-beta brass isappreciably higher than that ofalpha brass.
Alloys which contain ahard second phase located primarily atthegrain
boundaries present considerable forming problems because ofthetend-
ency forfracture tooccur along thegrain boundaries.
Astheresult ofamechanical working operation second-phase particles
willtend toassume ashape anddistribution which roughly correspond
tothedeformation ofthebody asawhole. Second-phase particles or
inclusions which areoriginally spheroidal willbedistorted intheprincipal
working direction intoanellipsoidal shape ifthey aresofter andmore
ductile than thematrix. Iftheinclusions orparticles arebrittle, they
willbebroken intofragments which willbeoriented parallel tothework-
ingdirection, while iftheparticles areharder andstronger than the

matrix, they willbeessentially undeformed.' Theorientation ofsecond-
phase particles during hotorcoldworking andthepreferred fragmen-
tation ofthegrains during coldworking areresponsible forthefibrous
structure which istypical ofwrought products. The fiber structure can
beobserved after macroetching (Fig. 17-3). Microscopic examination
ofwrought products frequently shows theresults ofthismechanical fiber-
ing(Fig. 17-4). Animportant consequence ofmechanical fibering isthat
themechanical properties maybedifferent fordifferent orientations of
thetestspecimen with respect tothe fiber (working) direction. In

Since precipitation isadiffusion-controlled process, difficulty from this
factor ismore likely when forming iscarried outataslowspeed atan

aluminum alloys, they arefrequently refrigerated just before forming
inorder tosuppress theprecipitation reaction.

17-5.Mechanics ofMetal Forming
One oftheprime objectives ofresearch inmetal forming istoexpress
theforces anddeformations involved informing processes inthemathe-
matical language ofapplied mechanics sothat predictions canbemade
about theforces required toproduce thedesired shape. Since theforces

Sec.17-5] General Fundamentals ofMetalworking 463
anddeformations aregenerally quite complex, itisusually necessary to
usesimplifying assumptions toobtain atractable solution. Thisbranch
ofmechanics isanoutgrowth ofthetheory ofplasticity discussed in
Chap. 3,which should bereviewed before completing thischapter and
theremaining chapters ofthisbook.
Plasticity theory hasmade important advances sinceWorld War II,
andnumerous efforts have beenmade toutilize thenewknowledge to
improve theaccuracy ofprediction ofthemetal-forming equations.
Most ofthiswork involves theuseoftheslip-field theory discussed briefly
inSec. 3-12. While inmany instances theuseofthesemoreadvanced
methods provides adeeper insight intotheforming process, usually this
additional information cannot beobtained without considerable increase
inmathematical complexity. Because ananalysis based onslip-field
theory cannot bemade with thebackground provided inChap. 3,indis-
cussing themathematical aspects ofspecific forming processes insucceed-
ingchapters only thesimpler equations willbederived. References to
moreadvanced treatments willbegiven wherever this isapplicable.
Themathematical descriptions oftechnologically important forming
processes which were developed bySiebeP andotherGerman workers
were based ontheassumption that themaximum-shear-stress lawwas
theproper criterion fordescribing thestress condition forproducing
plastic flow.-

Subsequent workshowed that thedistortion-energy, orVonMises, flow
criterion [Eq. (17-2)] provided better agreement withexperimental data.

Therefore, thedistortion-energy criterion foryielding istobepreferred
and willbeused inmost oftheanalyses offorming processes presented in
subsequent chapters. However, aswasseen inSec. 3-4,thedistortion-
energy andmaximum-shear-stress criteria differ atmostbyonly 15per
cent,and inview oftheuncertainties present intheanalysis ofsome of
thecomplex forming operations thetw^oyield criteria canbeconsidered
nearly equivalent. Therefore, themaximum-shear-stress law willbe
used incertain cases where itprovides appreciable simplification tothe
analysis.
Animportant feature ofplasticity theory istheassumption that the

introduction orremoval ofahj^drostatic ormean stress hasnoeffect on
theflow stress orthestate ofstrain. Itisconsidered thatonlythestress
deviator (seeSec.2-14) isofimportance inproducing plastic flow,and it
isthis stress term which appears intheplasticity equations [seeEq.
(3-42)]. Thisassumption isborne outbytheexperimental factthatthe
yield stress forthebeginning offlow isindependent ofthemean stress.
However, atlarge plastic strains thehydrostatic stress doeshaveaneffect
ontheflow stress. Forincreasing hydrostatic stress, theflowcurve at
large strains israised. Moreover, aswasshown inSec.7-16, theductility
ofmetals intension isappreciably increased when ahigh hydrostatic
pressure ispresent. This explains whynominally brittle materials may
often beextruded successfully, since ahigh hydrostatic compression is
developed owing tothereaction oftheworkpiece with theextrusion
container.
Because large deformations occur inmetal forming, itisimportant to
express stress andstrain astrue stress andtrue, ornatural, strain. Toa
verygood approximation itispermissible toassume that thevolume
remains constant during deformation. This leads totheconvenient

degree ofstrain hardening which occurs foragiven reduction ishigher

fact that themetal undergoes nonuniform flow during deformation
because itisnotallowed toflow freely. The lightly deformed regions

Flow curves foranumber ofsteels andnonferrous metals have been
obtained^ bythismethod.
Inmany plastic forming operations, such asextrusion, thestrains are
much greater than canbeobtained inatension orcompression test.
Itispossible togetgood estimates oftheflow stress forreductions greater
than 70to80percentbylinear extrapolation when ctqisplotted against
thelogarithm ofthestrain orthereduction inarea.^
Forhotworking themetal approaches anideal plastic material, and
theflow stress isconstant andindependent oftheamount ofdeformation
atagiven temperature andspeed ofdeformation. Toallow forstrain
hardening incoldworking, itiscustomary touseaconstant value of
flow stress which isanaverage overthetotal strain, asinFig. 17-6. An
alternative, which adds tothemathematical complexity, istoinclude a
mathematical expression fortheflowcurve intheanalysis. Usually this
islimited toasimple power function likeEq. (3-1).
Todescribe theplastic flow ofametal, itisjust asimportant to
describe thegeometry offlow inrelation tothestress system asitisto
beabletopredict thestress conditions toproduce plastic flow.Abasic
assumption ofplasticity theory which allows this isthat atanystage in
thedeformation process thegeometry ofstrain rates isthesame asthe
geometry ofstress, i.e.,that stress andstrain arecoaxial. This isagood
assumption uptomoderate strains, butatlarge strains, where preferred
orientations mayhavebeen developed, thestress andstrain systems usu-
allyarenotidentical. IfLode's stress andstrain parameters areequal
(seeSec. 3-5),then theplastic stress andstrain canbeconsidered coaxial.
Since metal-forming problems areconcerned with large strains ofthe
order ofunity, elastic strains oftheorder of0.001 arenegligible bycom-
parison andthemetal canbetreated asarigid plastic material. Regions
ofthemetal which havebeen strained only elastically andregions between
theelavstic-plastic boundary inwhich theyield stress hasbeen exceeded
butflow isconstrained bytheelastic region areconsidered toberigid.
Only flow inthecompletely plastic region ofthebody isconsidered in
therelatively simple analyses ofplastic forming given insucceeding
chapters. Byusing themore advanced slip-field theory, itispossible
toconsider thestress andstrain inboth theelastic and plastic regions,
andalsoalong theelastic-plastic boundary.

ingtheductility ofthemetal. Itisonlynatural thatattempts havebeen
made topredict thesuccess offorming operations onthebasis ofsimple
laboratory tests. Reliable information ontheflow stress required topro-
duce deformation canbeobtained with thetension orcompression test
forslow rates ofdeformation, butthere isnoconvenient testforexactly
determining these data athigh rates ofdeformation.
Because ofthedifficulty ofobtaining reliable dataonthedeformation
resistance ofmetals during hotworking athighdeformation rates anum-
berofempirical testshavebeendeveloped toevaluate thehotformability
ofmaterials. Thesingle-blow impact test^hasbeenused formany years
toevaluate whether ornotamaterial canbehot-worked without crack-
ing.Good correlation withhot-working operations, such asforging and
piercing ofsolidrounds tomake seamless tubes, hasbeen obtained with
thehottwist test.-'^ Inthis testthemetal isstressed intorsion ata
high rate. Thetorque required totwist thespecimen isameasure ofthe
flow stress, andthenumber oftwists before fracture isacriterion ofthe
ductility.
Thestandard measures ofductility which areobtained from thetension
test, elongation andreduction ofarea, giveonly averycrude indication
oftheeasewithwhich themetalmaybeformed without cracking. How-
ever, atleast aqualitative indication oftheforming limits forsheet-metal
forming canbeobtained from amore detailed analysis ofthetensile
stress-strain curve. Informing operations where thesheet isrestricted
from deforming inonearea while itisstretched intoshape inanother
region themetal must beabletodeform toalarge extent without localized
deformation. Ameasure ofitsability todothis istheuniform elonga-

coefficient should perform well inthistype offorming operation. For
sheet-metal forming operations likebending, rollforming, anddimpling,

Thereduction ofarea isaqualitative indication ofthisforming limit. A
common qualitative test fortheevaluation oftheformability ofsheet
metals isthebend test. Samples ofsheet arebentaround successively
smaller radii until cracking occurs onthetensile (outside) surface ofthe
bend. Theminimum bend radius istaken asthesmallest radius which
canbeused without cracking. Theminimum bend radius isusually

17-8. Friction inForming Operations
Animportant consideration intheforming ofmetals isthefriction
forces developed between theworkpiece andtheforming tools. Friction
forces canmaterially increase thedeformation resistance. They are
difficult tomeasure/ andtherefore theyrepresent oneofthemajor uncer-
tainties intheanalysis offorming operations. Various methods oflubri-
cation areused tominimize friction forces. Infact, theability tofinda
suitable lubricant often determines whether ornotaforming operation
willbesuccessful. Forexample, thehotextrusion ofsteelwasnotcom-
mercially possible until molten glass wasused asalubricant inthe
Ugine-Sejournet process, andthecoldextrusion ofsteel isnotpossible
without aphosphate coating foralubricant.
The friction between thework andthetools gives risetoshearing
stresses along thecontact surfaces. Therelationship between theshear-
ingstress r,thenormal stress ontheinterface between theworkandthe
tools, 0-,andthecoefficient offriction /isgenerally expressed byCou-
lomb's lawofsliding friction
l=f(17-19)
Thevalue ofthecoefficient offriction willdepend upon thematerial
being worked, thematerial used forthetools ordies, thesurface rough-
ness oftheworkandthetools, theefficiency ofthelubricant, thespeed
ofdeformation, andthetemperature. Friction increases withanincrease
intherelative motion between theworkandthetools, butathighspeeds
itdecreases appreciably. Thelowest coefficients offriction areofthe
order of0.01to0.05. These values occur under conditions ofslowspeed
and excellent lubrication where thetool surfaces arehighly polished.
Some typical values^ are/=0.05 forthecold rolling ofmild steelwith
flood lubrication and/=0.05 to0.15 forcolddrawing anddeepdrawing
ofsteel, copper, andbrass using hardened polished diesandefficient lubri-
cants. Avalue of/=0.10 istypical forthecold rolling ofmost metals
with polished rolls, but iftherollsurface isonlyaground finish, avalue
of/=0.15 ismore typical. The coefficients offriction areusually
higher forhotworking because oxidation roughens thework andthe
tools.Avalue of/=0.4 isfound forrolling steel atatemperature
between 700and1650°F, butonrolling above 2000°F thecoefficient of

17-9. Experimental Techniques forForming Analysis
Experimental investigations offorming operations require techniques
formeasuring theforming loads andthedeformations. Measurement
oftheforces presents nofundamental problems, although considerable
ingenuity isrequired toinstrument most pieces offorming equipment.
SR-4 strain gages andload cells, capacitance strain gages, andpiezo-
electric gages areordinarily used forthispurpose. Thegross deformation
oftheworkpiece canbedetermined bymeans ofconventional measuring
instruments. However, theinformation that isreally needed isthestrain
distribution throughout theworkpiece. Most theories offorming assume
thatthemetal isdeformed homogeneously; yetthere aremany indications
thatinhomogeneous deformation isthegeneral situation incommercial
forming processes. Theories ofplastic forming which arebased onthe
theory ofslip-line fieldsattempt totaketheinhomogeneity ofdeformation
into consideration. However, greater experimental information onthe
nature ofthedeformation informing processes isneeded toallow forthe
formulation ofmore realistic slip-line fields.
Most studies^ ofthedeformation informing operations haveemployed
gridnetworks. Anumber ofidentical specimens aredeformed bydiffer-
entamounts, andtheprogress ofthedeformation isdetermined from the
distortion ofthenetwork. Either rectangular orpolar-coordinate grids
areused, depending upon theapplication. The gridnetwork may be
applied either byscribing orbyphotographic methods. However, only
alimited amount ofinformation canbeobtained from grids placed on
thesurface oftheworkpiece. Theflow intheinterior oftheworkpiece
canbestudied bycutting thebillet inhalf, affixing agridnetwork tothe
two faces, fastening them back together, andthenmachining toasym-
metrical shape. Under certain circumstances theinterior deformation
canbedetermined byembedding alead grid inthecasting. The dis-
tortion ofthelead grid isobtained byradiographing thedeformed billet.
Sometimes plugs areinserted intheworkpiece, and their distortion is
measured bysectioning andexamining under themicroscope.
Metallographic techniques areuseful fordetermining regions ofheavy
deformation. The direction offlowcanbedetermined from thegrain
distortion andthepreferred alignment ofsecond-phase particles and
inclusions. Aninitially banded structure provides aunidirectional inter-
nalgridsystem. Etches areavailable formost metals which selectively

attack theplastically deformed regions. Since recrystallization willbegin
first inthemost heavily deformed grains, theexamination ofthemicro-
structure ofadeformed metal after annealing willindicate thepresence
ofnonuniform deformation.
Use issometimes made ofplasticine models^ forstudying inhomogene-
ousdeformation informing operations. Deformation inplasticine is
similar todeformation inanideal plastic material ;therefore plasticine is
useful forchecking theoretical analyses ofplastic forming. Grid "net-
works canbereadily placed intheinterior ofplasticine models, andonly
very lightequipment isneeded todeform thematerial. Similar studies
using paraffin wax^have alsobeenmade.

pressing. Itistheoldest ofthemetalworking arts,having itsorigin with
theprimitive blacksmith ofBiblical times. Thedevelopment ofmachin-
erytoreplace thearm ofthesmith occurred early during theIndustrial
Revolution. Today there isawide variety offorging machinery which
iscapable ofmaking parts ranging insizefrom abolttoaturbine rotor
oranentire airplane wing.
Most forging operations arecarried outhot,although certain metals
maybecold-forged. Twomajor classes ofequipment areused forforg-
ingoperations. Theforging hammer, ordrophammer, delivers rapid
impact blows tothesurface ofthemetal, while theforging press subjects
themetal toaslow-speed compressive force. With impact forging the
pressure isatmaximum intensity when thehammer touches themetal,
and itdecreases rapidly inintensity astheenergy oftheblow isabsorbed
indeforming themetal. Therefore, impact forging produces deformation
primarily inthesurface layers. Inpress forging thepressure increases
asthemetal isbeing deformed, and itsmaximum value isobtained just
before thepressure isreleased. Therefore, press forging results indeeper
penetration ofthedeformed zone.
Inmany forging processes open dies ofsimple geometrical shape are
used. This istrue forvery large objects orwhere thenumber ofitems
produced issmall. Thesimplest forging operation istheupsetting ofa
cylinder between two flatdies (Fig. 18-1). Thecompressive forces cause
themetal toflowoutequally inalldirections, sothat ideally the final
shape would beacylinder ofincreased diameter anddecreased height
(Fig. 18-16). However, because there isalways friction between thedies
andthemetal, thecylinder flows toalesser extent atthese interfaces
than itdoes atthecenter. The resulting shape istherefore acylinder
which isbarreled atthecenter (Fig. 18-lc). This illustrates thegeneral
rulethatametal willflowmost easily toward thenearest free surface,

which isthepoint ofleast resistance. Iftheworkpiece hasanoncylindri-
calshape (Fig. 18-ld), thegreatest flow willoccur along thenarrowest
sides (Fig. 18-le).
The effect offriction inrestraining metal flow isused toproduce shapes
with simple dies. Edging diesareused toshape theends ofbarsandto
gather metal. Asisshown inFig.18-2a and h,themetal isconfined by
thediefrom flowing inthehorizontal direction but itisfree toflow
laterally to fillthe die. Fullering isused toreduce thecross-sectional
area ofaportion ofthestock. Themetal flow isoutward andaway

ofthistype ofoperation would beintheforging ofaconnecting rodfor
aninternal-combustion engine. Thereduction incross section ofthe
work withconcurrent increase inlength iscalled drawing down, ordraw-
ingout(Fig. 18-2d). Ifthedrawing-down operation iscarried outwith
concave dies (Fig. 18-2e) soastoproduce abarofsmaller diameter, itis
called swaging. Other operations which canbeachieved byforging are
bending, twisting, extrusion, piercing (Fig. 18-2/), punching (Fig. 18-2gr),
andindenting.

duce forgings toclose dimensional tolerances. Large production runs

wide flash, aridge,known asaflash gutter,
isusually provided (Fig. 18-3). The final
step inmaking aclosed-die forging isthe
removal oftheflash with atrimming die.

while thosemade onapress arecalled

Inforging hammers theforce issupplied byafalling weight, orram.
Thetwobasic types offorging hammers arethehoardhammer andthe
steamhammer (Fig. 18-4). Intheboardhammer theupper dieandram
areraised byrollsgripping theboard. When theram isreleased, itfalls
owing togravity. Theenergy supplied totheblow isequal tothepoten-
tialenergy duetotheweight oftheramandtheheight ofthe fall. Board
hammers arerated bytheweight ofthefalling part oftheequipment.
They range from 400-lb hammers with a35-in. fallto7,500-lb hammers
witha75-in. fall. Thistype ofequipment iscapable ofproducing forg-
ingsweighing uptoabout 100 lb.
Greater forging capacity, intherange from 1,000 to50,000 lb,isavail-
ablewith thesteam hammer (Fig. 18-4). Steam isadmitted tothe
bottom ofacylinder toraise theram,and itenters thetoptodrive the

energy supplied totheblow isrelated tothekinetic energy ofthefalling

bottom ofthestroke. Most mechanical presses operate fromaneccentric
crank (Fig. 18-4). Loads of100to7,000 tons arecommercially avail-
able. Vertical hydraulic presses usually have thepressure chamber
located ontopofthepress (Fig. 18-4). High pressures arebuiltupin
theintensifier cylinders byusing oilorwater asthehydraulic medium.
Hydraulic presses aregenerally built toratings of500to18,000 tons,
although several presses with ratings of50,000 tonshave been built.^
Large hydraulic presses areparticularly adaptable totheopen-die forg-
ingofsteel ingots andtheclosed-die forging ofaluminum andmagnesium.
Forging machines, alsoknown asupsetters, orheaders, arehorizontal
presses which arevery useful forthehigh-production forging ofsymmetri-
calshapes frombarstock. Themachine isbasically adouble-acting press
with dieswhich firmly griptheworkaround thecircumference andform-
ingtoolswhich upset themetal. Bolts, rivets, andgears aretypical parts
made with forging machines. Forging machines arerated interms of
themaximum-diameter barwhich canbegripped bythemachine.
Forging rollsareused forinitial forming prior toclosed-die forging and
forproducing tapered sections orlong, slender sections. The rollsuse
only part oftheir circumference toreduce themetal. Theremaining
portion isreduced indiameter sothat theforged partcanmove freely
between therolls. Theoperator stands attherear oftherolls,andwhen
theclearance space appears, heinserts thework. When thereducing
portion ofthe rollscomes incontact with thework, itisreduced and
ejected toward theoperator. Different portions ofthework canbesuc-
cessively fedinto the rolls orfed
through other grooves toproduce
increased reductions. Long boltsand
spring leaves areoftenmade onforg-
ingrolls.
Rotary swaging, orrotary forging,
subjects abarortube toaseries of
blows from two dieswhich rotate
around thestock sothat itisham-
mered from allsides. Figure 18-5
illustrates theoperation oftheswag-
ingmachine. Two dies,backed up
byhammers, arerotated with the
spindle. The spindle rotates ina
cage containing anumber ofhardened steel rollers. When theham-
mers contact the rollers, thedies areforced together, butwhen the
spindle rotates thehammers toaposition between the rollers, thedies
flyopen owing tocentrifugal force. Thus, thework issubjected to

entirely compressive. For thisreason small swaging machines have
found considerable use asalaboratory method ofdecreasing the
diameter ofrelatively brittle materials. Onacommercial basis swaging
isused forreducing thediameter ofrodandtubing, forpointing rodprior
towiredrawing, andforattaching sleeves tocable ends.
18-3. Deformation inCompression
Thecompression ofaflatplate oracylinder between two flatdies
represents thesimplest type offorging operation. Although atfirst
glance thisappears tobeasimple type ofexperiment which issubject to
easy analysis, inactuality acompression experiment isusually compli-
cated bythepresence offriction between thediesandthespecimen.

When friction ispresent between thediesandthespecimen, themetal
adjacent tothese regions undergoes little ornodeformation. The speci-
mendeforms intheinhomogeneous manner shown inFig. 18-6,andthe
specimen assumes abarreled shape. Theshaded areas inFig.18-6repre-

Another common surface defect inclosed-die forgings isthecold shut,

times thediameter ofthestock. General rules fortheoptimum dimen-
sions forupsetting inforging machines havebeen developed.^
Secondary tensile stresses candevelop during forging, andcracking can
thusbeproduced. Internal cracks candevelop during theupsetting ofa
cylinder oraround (Fig. 18-lOc), asaresult ofthecircumferential tensile
stresses. Proper design ofthe dies, however, canminimize thistype
ofcracking. Inorder tominimize bulging during upsetting andthe
development ofcircumferential tensile stresses, itisusual practice touse
concave dies. Internal cracking islessprevalent inclosed-die forging
because lateral compressive stresses aredeveloped bythereaction ofthe
work with thediewall.
Thedeformation produced byforging results inacertain degree of
directionality tothemicrostructure inwhich second phases andinclusions
areoriented parallel tothedirection ofgreatest deformation. When
viewed atlowmagnification, thisappears asflow lines, orfiber structure.
Theexistence ofafiber structure ischaracteristic ofallforgings and is
nottobeconsidered asaforging defect. However, aswasdiscussed in
Sec. 9-11, thefiber structure results inlower tensile ductility andfatigue
properties inthedirection normal toit(transverse direction) .Toachieve
anoptimum balance between theductility inthelongitudinal andtrans-
verse directions ofaforging, itisoften necessary tolimit theamount of
deformation to50to70percentreduction incross section.
18-8. Residual Stresses inForginss
Theresidual stresses produced inforgings asaresult ofinhomogeneous
deformation aregenerally quite small because thedeformation isusually
carried outwell into thehot-working region. However, appreciable
residual stresses andwarping canoccur onthequenching ofsteel forg-
ings inheattreatment (Sec. 15-6).
Special precautions must beobserved during thecooling oflarge steel
forgings from thehot-working temperature. Large forgings aresubject
totheformation ofsmall cracks, orflakes, atthecenter ofthecross
section. Flaking isassociated with thehighhydrogen content usually
present insteel ingots oflarge size,coupled with thepresence ofresidual
stresses. Inorder toguard against thedevelopment ofhighthermal or
transformation residual stresses, large forgings areveryslowly cooled from
theworking temperature. Thismaybeaccomplished byburying the
forging inashes forperiods uptoseveral weeks or,inthecontrolled cool-
ingtreatment which isused forhot-rolled railroad railandcertain forg-
ings,bytransferring thehotforgin? toanautomatically controlled cooling
cyclewhich brings theforging toasafetemperature inanumber ofhours.

ROLLING OFMETALS
19-1. ClassiFication ofRollins Processes
Theprocess ofplastically deforming metal bypassing itbetween rolls
isknown asrolling. This isthemost widely usedmetalworking process
because itlends itself tohigh production and close control ofthefinal
product. Indeforming metal between rolls, thework issubjected to
highcompressive stresses from thesqueezing action ofthe rollsandto
surface shear stresses asaresult ofthefriction between therollsandthe
metal. The frictional forces arealsoresponsible fordrawing themetal
intothe rolls.
The initial breakdown ofingots intoblooms and billets isgenerally
donebyhot rolling. This isfollowed byfurther hotrolling into plate,
sheet, rod, bar, pipe, rails, orstructural shapes. The cold rolling of
metals hasreached aposition ofmajor importance inindustry. Cold roll-
ingproduces sheet, strip, and foilwithgood surface finish andincreased
mechanical strength, atthesame timemaintaining close control overthe
dimensions oftheproduct.
Theterminology used todescribe rolled products isfairly loose, and
sharp limits with respect todimensions cannot always bemade forsteel-
making terminology. Abloom istheproduct ofthe firstbreakdown of
theingot. Generally thewidth ofabloom equals itsthickness, andthe
cross-sectional area isgreater than 36in.^Afurther reduction byhot
rolling results inabillet. Theminimum cross section ofabillet isabout
1/^by13^ in. Itshould benoted that innonferrous metallurgical termi-
nology abillet isanyingot which hasreceived hotworking byrolling,
forging, orextrusion, orthetermmay refer toacasting which issuitable
forhotworking, asanextrusion billet. Aslabrefers toahot-rolled ingot
with across-sectional area greater than 16in.^andwith awidth that is
atleast twice thethickness. Blooms, billets, and slabs areknown as
semifinished ^products because they aresubsequently formed intoother
millproducts. Thedifferentiation between plateand sheet isdetermined
bythethickness oftheproduct. Ingeneral, plate hasathickness greater

than 3'4in.,although there areexceptions tothisHmit, depending upon
thewidth. Sheetand strip refer torolled products which generally have
athickness lessthan yiin.Ingeneral, strip refers totherolled product
with awidth nogreater than 12in.,while sheet refers totheproduct of
greater width.
Generally rolling starts with acast ingot, butthis isnotanecessary
requirement. Arecent development ispowder rolling. Metal powder is
introduced between therollsandcompacted intoa"green strip," which is
subsequently sintered tohigh density. Theadvantages claimed^ forthis
process arethattheelimination ofhotworking minimizes contamination,
results inafinegrain size,andproduces asheet withnopreferred orien-
tation. Powder rolling isstill initsinfancy, but itappears tohave defi-
niteadvantages forreactive metals.
Inconventional hotorcold rolling themain objective istodecrease
thethickness ofthemetal. Ordinarily little increase inwidth occurs,
sothatthedecrease inthickness results inanincrease inlength. Roll
forming isaspecial type ofcold rolling inwhich strip isprogressively
bent intocomplex shapes bypassing itthrough aseries ofdriven rolls.
Thethickness ofthemetal isnotappreciably changed during thisprocess.
Rollforming isparticularly suited toproducing long, molded sections
such asirregular-shaped channels andtrim. Another specialized useof
rolling isthread rolling, inwhich ablank isfedbetween twogrooved die
plates toform thethreads.
19-2. Rollins Equipment
Arolling mill consists basically ofrolls, bearings, ahousing forcon-
taining these parts, andadrive forapplying power totherollsandcon-
trolling their speed. Theforces involved inrolling caneasily reachmany
millions ofpounds. Therefore, very rigid construction isneeded, and
very large motors arerequired toprovide thenecessary power. When
these requirements aremultiplied several times forthesuccessive stands
ofalarge continuous mill, itiseasy toseewhyamodern rolling-mill
installation demands many millions ofdollars ofcapital investment and
many man-hours ofskilled engineering design andconstruction.
Rolling millscanbeconveniently classified with respect tothenumber
andarrangement oftherolls (Fig. 19-1). Thesimplest andmostcommon
type ofrolling mill isthetwo-high mill (Fig. 19-la). Rolls ofequal size
arerotated only inonedirection. Thestock isreturned totheentrance,
orrear, ofthe rolls forfurther reduction byhand carrying orbymeans
ofaplatform which canberaised topassthework above the rolls. An
obvious improvement inspeed results from theuseofatwo-high reversing

mill, inwhich thework canbepassed backandforth through therolls
byreversing their direction ofrotation (Fig. 19-16). Another solution is
thethree-high mill (Fig. 19-lc), consisting ofanupper andlower driven
rollandamiddle rollwhich rotates byfriction.
Alarge decrease inthepower required forrolling canbeachieved by
theuseofsmall-diameter rolls. However, because small-diameter rolls
have lessstrength andrigidity than large rolls, theymust besupported
bylarger-diameter backup rolls. Thesimplest mill ofthistype isthe

four-high mill (Fig. 19-ld). Very thin sheet canberolled tovery close
tolerances onamillwith small-diameter work rolls. The cluster mill
(Fig. 19-le), inwhich each ofthework rolls issupported bytwobacking
rolls, isatypical mill ofthiskind. TheSendzimir mill isamodification

bymeans oftheSteckel mill islimited, because itusessmall work rolls
itcanreduce hardmetals tothingages with close tolerances onthickness.
19-3. HotRolling
The firsthot-working operation formost steelproducts isdone inthe
blooming mill (also called cogging mill). Blooming mills areusually two-
high reversing millswith 24-to54-in. -diameter rolls. Because blooming
represents theinitial breakdown oftheingot structure, itisdone insmall,
careful steps with repeated reheating. Itisnotunusual torequire 25
passes fortheblooming ofalarge alloy-steel ingot. Toproduce thesize
ofbillet required bysmaller finishing mills, itisoften necessary toreroll
theblooms onathree-high, orcontinuous, billet mill. The billetsmay
thenberolled intoround bars, hexagons, special shapes, orflatsonvarious
types offinishing mills.
Sheared plate isproduced bycross-rolling billets ontwo-high, three-
high,andfour-high millsandthen shearing alledges tosize. Theother
common method ofrolling plate isonauniversal mill. Thistype ofmill
consists oftwo rolling mills, onewithtwohorizontal rollsandtheother
with four vertical rolls soarranged thattheycanbeused forside rolling.
^universal millcantakeaningot and roll itdirectly into plate with

straight edges thatneednoshearing. Bythismethod ofroUing theingot
ismerely elongated inthelongitudinal direction, and itthus receives no
cross rolling. Therefore, plateproduced withtheuniversal mill willhave
lower transverse ductility than plate produced bycross rolling.
Hot-rolled steel strip hasbeenproduced ontandem continuous mills
since about 1930. The starting material isarolled slabwhich is
initially heated to2200°F. Thecontinuous mill consists ofaroughing
train offour toseven stands andafinishing train offour toeight stands.
Theroughing train contains two-high scale-breaking rollsandaspread-
ingmillforspreading theslabtothedesired width. Thefour-high reduc-
ingstands usually areequipped with vertical edging rolls tocontrol the
width ofthestrip. High-pressure water jetsareusually sprayed onthe
strip tobreak upthe scale. Four-high mills areused inthefinishing
train. The finishing temperature varies from 1300 to1600°F, depending
onthethickness andthedesired grain sizeandmechanical properties.
The fact that thenonferrous-metals industry deals with adiverse
product mix isresponsible forthefactthatnonferrous hot-rolling equip-
ment isgenerally more versatile and lessspecialized andmechanized than
theequipment used forthehotrolling ofsteel. Further, thesmaller
ingot sizesandlower flow stresses found with nonferrous metals gener-
allymean that smaller rolling mills canbeused. Two- andthree-high
mills areused formost hot rolling, although continuous four-high hot
millshavebeen installed forrolling aluminum alloys.
19-4. Cold Rollins
Cold rolling isused toproduce sheet and strip with superior surface
finish anddimensional tolerances compared with hot-rolled strip. In
addition, thestrain hardening resulting from thecoldreduction maybe
used togive increased strength. Agreater percentage ofrolled non-
ferrous metals isfinished bycold rolling compared with rolled-steel prod-
ucts. The starting material forcold rolled-steel sheet ispickled hot-
rolled breakdown coilfrom thecontinuous hot-strip mill. Cold-rolled
nonferrous sheetmaybeproduced from hot-rolled strip, orinthecase of
certain copper alloys itiscold-rolled directly from thecast state.
High-speed four-high tandem mills with three tofivestands areused
forthecold rolling ofsteel sheet, aluminum, andcopper alloys. Gener-
ally, thistype ofmill isdesigned toprovide both frontandback tension.
Acontinuous millhashighcapacity andresults inlowlabor costs. For
example, thedelivery speed ofafive-stand continuous millcanreach
6,000 ft/min. However, thistype ofequipment requires alarge capital
investment andsuffers further from lack ofversatility. Four-high single-
stand reversing mills with front andback tension areamore versatile

cialty iienis that varj^widely indimensions. However, itcannot compete
with thecontinuous-tandem millwhere large tonnages areinvolved.
The elimination oftheyield point from annealed-steel sheet isan
important practical problem since theexistence ofayield-point elonga-
tion results ininhomogeneous deformation (stretcher strains) during deep
drawing orforming. Theusual practice istogivetheannealed steel a
final, small cold reduction, temper rolling, orskin pass,which eliminates
theyield-point elongation. Temper rolling also results inanimproved
surface and inimproved flatness. Other methods which areused to
increase theflatness ofrolled sheet areroller leveling and stretcher leveling.
Aroller-leveling machine consists oftwosetsofsmall-diameter rollswhich
arearranged sothatthetopandbottom rows areoffset. When thesheet
ispassed into the leveler, itisflexed upanddown andthesheet is
straightened asitemerges from the rolls. The stretcher leveler con-
sists oftwojawswhich griptheedges ofthesheetandstretch itwitha
pure tensile force.
19-5. Rolling ofBarsandShapes
Bars ofcircular orhexagonal cross section andstructural shapes like
Ibeams, channels, andrailroad rails areproduced ingreat quantity by
hotrolling withgrooved rolls (Fig. 19-3). Actually, thehotbreakdown
ofaningot intoabloom falls inthiscategory sincegrooved rolls areused
tocontrol thechanges inshape during theblooming operation.
The rolling ofbarsandshapes differs from therolling ofsheetandstrip
inthatthecross section ofthemetal isreduced intwodirections. How-
ever, inanyonepass themetal isusually compressed inonedirection
only. Onthenext pass itisrotated 90°. Since themetal spreads toa
much greater extent inthehotrolling ofbarsthan incold rolling ofsheet,
animportant problem indesigning passes forbarsandshapes istopro-
videallowance forthespreading. Atypical method ofreducing asquare
billet toabar isbyalternate passes through ovalandsquare-shaped
grooves. Thedesign ofrollpasses forstructural shapes ismuch more
complicated andrecjuires extensive experience.^Because different metals
spread different amounts, itisnotgenerally possible torollmetals of
widely different rolling characteristics onthesame setofbar rolls.
Arolling milldesigned torollbars isknown asabarmill, ormerchant
mill. Most production barmills areequipped with guides tofeed the

Thedistribution ofrollpressure along thearcofcontact isindicated in

then falls off.The factthatthepressure distribution doesnotcome to
asharp peak attheneutral point, asrequired intheoretical treatments
ofrolling, indicates thattheneutral point isnotreally alineonthe roll

rolling load,which forpurposes ofcalculation actsatthecenter ofgravity

oftheresultant rolling loadwith respect

inFig. 19-5andthepressure distribution forplane-strain compression

19-7. Main Variables inRollins
Themain variables which control therolling process are (1)the roll
diameter, (2)thedeformation resistance ofthemetal, (3)thefriction
between the rollsandthemetal, and (4)thepresence offront tension
andback tension. Inthissection theeffect ofthese factors willbecon-
sidered chiefly from thestandpoint oftheir influence ontherolling load.
Increasing thediameter ofthe rolls results inalarge increase inthe
rolling load forgiven reduction and frictional conditions. Foragiven
reduction ofasheet ofacertain thickness thecontact area willbegreater
foralarge-diameter roll. Equation (19-2) shows that thecontact area
isdirectly proportional toZ)''^. Therefore, foragiven pressure required
todeform themetal thetotal rolling load willincrease withtherolldiam-
eter. However, therolling load increases with rolldiameter atarate
greater than /)''-because oftherequirement toovercome thegreater
frictional forces acting over thelarger area ofcontact. Intheprevious
chapter itwasshown that theaverage uniaxial stress required tocom-
press cylinders ofequal height butvarying diameter increases with the
diameter ofthecylinder. The effect ofrolldiameter onrolling load is
thedirect analog forthecase ofrolling.
Similarly, forcylinders ofconstant diameter butvarying thickness the
average uniaxial compressive yield stress increases with decreasing height
ofthecylinder. Thecompressive force required todeform thecylinder
canincrease toquite highvalues compared with thetrueflow stresswhen
thethickness isasmall fraction ofthediameter. Asimilar situation
existswhen thesheet thickness issmall compared with thecontact area
ofthe rolls. The rolling load increases asthesheet entering the rolls
becomes thinner. Eventually apoint isreached where thedeformation
resistance ofthesheet isgreater than the rollpressure which canbe
applied andnofurther reduction inthickness canbeachieved. When
thisoccurs, therolls incontact with thesheet areelastically deformed
and itiseasier fortherolls todeform than forthesheet todeform plasti-
cally. The rolldiameter hasanimportant influence onthelimiting
reduction possible with arolling mill. Both therolling loadandthe
length ofthearcofcontact decrease forsmaller-diameter rolls. There-
fore, with small-diameter rolls, properly stiffened against deflection by
backup rolls, itispossible toproduce agreater reduction before roll
flattening becomes important andnofurther reduction insheet thickness
occurs.
Since sheet rolling isessentially aplane-strain process, theconstrained
flow stress forrolling isthevalue obtained intension orcompression
multiplied bythefactor 2/-\/3. Theplane-strain flow stress canalsobe
obtained directly from theplane compression testdiscussed inSec. 17-5.

Sec.19-7] Rollins ofMetals 499
Theflow stress forcold rolling does notdepend much onthestrain rate
orrollspeed. However, ashasbeenemphasized earlier, inhotrolling
changes inthestrain ratecanproduce significant changes intheflow
stress ofthemetal.^
The friction between the rollandthemetal surface isofgreat impor-
tance inrolling. Notonlydoes thefrictional force pullthemetal into
the rolls, but italso affects themagnitude anddistribution ofthe roll
pressure. Reference toFig. 19-5shows that thelarger thefrictional
forces thegreater must betherolling loadandthemore steeply thepres-
surebuilds uptoward amaximum value attheneutral point. Because
the rollpressure distribution issostrongly dependent onthefriction,
apressure distribution likethat ofFig. 19-5 iscommonly called the
friction hill. High friction results inhigh rolling loadsandalsoproduces
greater lateral spread andedge cracking. Ontheother hand, verylow
values offriction, such asareobtained incold rolling with lubrica-
tionandpolished rolls,may lead todifficulties infeeding themetal into
the rolls.
The friction varies from point topoint along thecontact arcofthe roll.
However, because itisextremely difficult tomeasure thispressure distri-
bution, ^alltheories ofrolling areforced toassume aconstant coefficient
offriction. Onthebasis ofthisassumption, coefficients offriction can
beobtained frommeasured values ofrolling loadandtorque.^ Ifback
tension isgradually applied tothestrip until theneutral point ismoved
totheexit ofthe rolls, then thefriction acts inonedirection only. For
aconstant rollspeed andconstant reduction, thecoefficient offriction /
canbecalculated from thetotal rolling loadPandthetorqueMrby

Values of/obtained bythismethod aresomewhat higher than those
obtained byother methods.
Theminimum-thickness sheet thatcanberolled onagiven mill is
directly related tothecoefficient offriction. Since thefriction coeffi-
cients forhotrolling ofsteelcanvaryfrom 0.20 to0.70, while forcold
rolling values of0.03to0.12aremore typical, itcanbeseenthatthinner-
gage sheet isobtainable with cold rolling. Thethickness ofthesheet
produced onacold-rolling millcanalsobechanged appreciably byalter-
ingtherolling speed. With increasing rolling speed thethickness ofthe
sheet isdecreased. This isdirectly attributable tothedecrease infric-
tion coefficient with increasing rolling speed.^
Thepresence offrontandback tension intheplane ofthesheet can
materially reduce therolling load. That thisshould besocanbeseen
readily byassuming that thedeformation resistance ofthemetal is
governed byamaximum-shear-stress lawci—0-3=a'o.Since ai,the
rollpressure, and 0-3,thehorizontal tension stress, areopposite insign,
itbecomes apparent that thedeformation resistance adisreached ata
lower value ofaiwhen 0-3ispresent. Thereduction inrollpressure due
tostrip tension decreases thewear ofthe rolls. Another important
advantage ofstrip tension isthat itimproves theflatness andthickness
uniformity across thewidth ofasheet. Astudy ^oftheeffect oftension
onrolling hasshown thatback tension isabout twice aseffective in
reducing therolling loadasfront tension. The rolling loadwhen tension
isapplied, Pt,canbecalculated from thefollowing equation.

theneutral point willeventually reach therollexit.When thishappens,
therollsaremoving faster than themetal andthey slideoverthesurface.
Ontheother hand, ifonly front tension isused, theneutral point will
move toward therollentrance.
19-8. Deformation inRolling
Thedeformation produced byrolling canbeconsidered tobetwo-
dimensional. Toagoodapproximation insheet rolling, thereduction in
thickness istransferred intoanincrease inlength with little increase in
thewidth. Thus, there isgood justification fortheuseofaplane-strain
model inthemathematical analysis ofrolling. While thelateral spread
isusually oflittle importance inrolling sheetand strip, intherolling of
barsandshapes thiscanresult intheformation offlash, which produces
surface defects. Theamount oflateral spread depends onsuch factors

asthediameter andcondition oftherolls, theflowproperties ofthemetal,
andtheamount ofreduction. According toTrinks,^ thelateral spread
equals 0.25 to0.40times thereduc-
tiontimes thecontact length.
Incomparison with other metal-
working processes thedeformation
produced byrolling isrelatively uni-
form. However, studies with grid
networks haveshown that thesur-
face layers arenotonlycompressed

Theprevention offlakes orcooling cracks isanimportant consider-
ation with railroad railandother rolled shapes. Special controlled cool-
ingschedules areused forthese items tominimize theresidual stresses,
which aremainly responsible forthisproblem. Control ofthethickness
andflatness ofrolled sheetand strip isanimportant problem. Most of
thevariation inthickness along therolling direction isduetochanges in
therolling speed orstrip tension. Variation ineither thethickness or
hardness ofthematerial entering therolls willalsocause avariation in
thickness. Very elaborate devices forcontinuously measuring thesheet
thickness andadjusting themilloperating conditions have been devel-
oped tocontrol thethickness incontinuous rolling mills.^Variation in
thickness inthewddth direction isrelated tothedeflection ofthe rolls.
Asetofparallel rolls willdeflect under load toproduce asheet which is
thicker atthecenter than attheedges. Tocompensate forthis, itis
customary tocamber, orcrown, therolls sothattheworking surfaces are
parallel when the rolls deflect under load. Theproper rollcrown, or
camber, willdepend ontherolling load,- andtherefore, iftherollsarenot
operated attheconditions forwhich theywere designed, sheet withedge
orcenter waves will result.
19-10. Residual Stresses inRolled Products
Two general types ofresidual-stress patterns canexist inrolled sheet
and strip. ^Inthecase ofsheet which hasbeen given asmall reduction,
asintemper rolling, sothat theplastically deformed region does not
extend much below theouter surface, thelongitudinal residual-stress
pattern willbecompressive atthesurface and tensile atthemidplane
ofthestrip (seeFig. 15-1). Forthemore usual case oflarge reductions
theplastic flowpenetrates completely through thestrip. Forthis situ-
ation thelongitudinal residual pattern willconsist oftension ontheouter
surfaces andcompression attheinterior.
Inspite ofthegreat technological importance ofrolling, there isvery

little published information ontheresidual stresses imposed bythisproc-
ess. Little information ontheresidual stresses inanydirection except
therolling (longitudinal) direction ofthestrip isavailable, although itis
likely that abiaxial state ofstress exists atthesurface. The greatest
amount ofinformation ontheeffect ofrolling variables ontheresulting
residual stresses isavailable forabearing bronze.^
Themagnitude oftheresidual stress atthesurface ofarolled strip
depends primarily ontherolldiameter, thestrip thickness, andthereduc-
tion inthickness. The residual stress increases with theratio ofstrip
thickness tocontact length. Thus, athick strip, alight reduction, anda
small-diameter roll alltend togiveahigh residual stress. Moreover, the
larger thesheet thickness relative tothecontact length, thegreater the
tendency forthedeformation tobeconcentrated atthesurface. There-
fore, small rolldiameter, light reductions, andthick strip alltend togive
aresidual-stress pattern which iscompressive atthesurface and tensile
attheinterior ofthestrip. Theevidence that isavailable indicates that
thefinal residual-stress pattern isdetermined primarily bytheconditions
ofthelastpassthrough the rolls. Therefore, thefinal skinpasswhich is
used toprovide close control ofthedimensions canproduce high residual
stresses despite thefactthatlowresidual stresses wereproduced bythe
previous passes.
19-11. Theories ofCold Rolling
Probably morework hasbeenexpended indeveloping atheoretical
treatment ofcold rolling than foranyother metalworking process. A
theory ofrolling isaimed atexpressing theexternal forces, such asthe
rolling loadandtherolling torque, interms ofthegeometry ofthedefor-
mation andthestrength properties ofthematerial being rolled.
The differential equation fortheequilibrium ofanelement ofmaterial
being deformed between rolls iscommon toallthetheories ofrolling.
Thederivation given below isbased onthefollowing assumptions.
1.Thearcofcontact iscircular—noelastic deformation ofthe rolls.
2.The coefficient offriction isconstant atallpoints onthearcof
contact.
3.There isnolateral spread, sothat rolling canbeconsidered aprob-
lem inplane strain.
4.Plane vertical sections remain plane.
5.Theperipheral velocity oftherolls isconstant.
().The elastic deformation ofthesheet isnegligible incomparison with
theplastic deformation.

However, amodification hasbeen developed^ which results inclose
agreement with Orowan's solution forthis particular situation. In
making exact calculations acorrection^ should beincluded fortheeffect
oftheelastic deformation ofthesheet just infront oftheentrance and
exittothe rolls. When allthecorrections areusedwith theBland and
Ford solution, therolling loadandtorque canbecalculated with high
precision. Itis,however, necessary tomake aslight correction tothe
flowcurve determined inplane compression inorder tocorrect forthe
redundant shearing thatoccurs intherolling process.
When thesheet isboth thinandhard, rollflattening becomes severe
andtheelastic regions inthesheet atentry andexittotherollsbecome
important factors. Under these conditions thetheory outlined above
nolonger applies. Although there isnoreally satisfactory theory of
rolling forthese conditions, itispossible tomake afairly reliable pre-
diction oftheminimum thickness ofsheet that isobtainable under a
given setofrolling conditions. FordandAlexander^ haveshown that

Equation (19-21) shows that theminimum sheet thickness canbe
obtained byincreasing themodulus ofthe rolls orthesheet tension or
bydecreasing thefriction, the rolldiameter, andtheflow stress. When
equipment isnotavailable foraltering these variables intheproper way,
itisoften possible toachieve areduction inrolling loadandadecrease in
theminimum thickness bysandwich, orpack, rolling thehard sheet

problem. Asinother hot-working processes, theflow stress forhot roll-
ing isafunction ofboth thetemperature andthestrain rate(speed of
rolling).
The strain rateduring rolling isafunction oftheposition along the
arcofcontact, indicated bytheangle 6.While precise measurement of
thecoefficient offriction during hotrolling hasnotbeenmade, itisknown
thatthevalues arehigher than forcold rolling. Infact, there areindi-
cations thatthetangential forcefpcanreach values ashigh astheplane-

Ingeneral, forequal conditions, therate ofdeformation with slipping

Although inhotworking theflow stress doesnotincrease because of
strain hardening, nevertheless, since thestrain ratevaries along thearc
ofcontact, theflow stress willvaryandthismay affect thepressure distri-
bution. Inusing thetheories ofhotrolling, tobedescribed shortly, itis
sufficiently accurate tocompute amean deformation rate. This value
should beusedwithpublished data- oncompression tests atvarious strain
rates toarrive atamean flow stress.

EXTRUSION
20-1. ClassiFication ofExtrusion Processes
Extrusion istheprocess bywhich ablock ofmetal isreduced incross
section byforcing ittoflowthrough adieorifice under high pressure.
Ingeneral, extrusion isused toproduce cylindrical bars orhollow tubes,
butshapes ofirregular cross section maybeproduced from themore
readily extrudable metals, likealuminum. Because ofthelarge forces
required inextrusion, most metals areextruded hotunder conditions
where thedeformation resistance ofthemetal islow. However, cold
extrusion ispossible formany metals and israpidly achieving animpor-
tantcommercial position. Thereaction oftheextrusion billet with the
container anddieresults inhighcompressive stresses which areeffective
inreducing thecracking ofmaterials during primary breakdown from the
ingot. This isanimportant reason fortheincreased utilization ofextru-
sion intheworking ofmetals difficult toform, likestainless steels, nickel-
base alloys, andmolybdenum.
Thetwobasic types ofextrusion aredirect extrusion andindirect extru-
sion (also called inverted, orback, extrusion). Figure 20-la illustrates
theprocess ofdirect extrusion. Themetal billet isplaced inacontainer
anddriven through thediebytheram.Adummy block, orpressure
plate, isplaced attheendoftheram incontact with thebillet. Figure
20-16 illustrates theindirect-extrusion process. Ahollow ram carries the
die,while theother end ofthecontainer isclosed with aplate. Fre-
quently, forindirect extrusion, theramcontaining thedie iskept sta-
tionary, andthecontainer with the billet iscaused tomove. Because
there isnorelative motion between thewall ofthecontainer andthe
billet inindirect extrusion, thefriction forces arelower andthepower
required forextrusion islessthan fordirect extrusion. However, there
arepractical limitations toindirect extrusion because therequirement for
using ahollow ram limits theloads which canbeapplied.
Tubes canbeproduced byextrusion byattaching amandrel tothe
end oftheram. Theclearance between themandrel andthediewall
514

)CC.20-1 Extrus 515
determines thewallthickness ofthetube. Tubes areproduced either by
starting withahollow billet orbyatwo-step extrusion operation inwhich
asolid billet isfirstpierced andthenextruded.
Extrusion wasoriginally applied tothemaking ofleadpipeand later
totheleadsheathing ofcable. Figure 20-2 illustrates theextrusion ofa
leadsheath onelectrical cables.

preformed metal cup isplaced inadie,andapunch, with amandrel that
fitstheinside diameter ofthecup, strikes thecup athigh velocity.
Pressure isexerted onthecupbytheshoulder ofthepunch, and itis
extruded into atube. Impact extrusions aremade onhigh-velocity
mechanical presses. Theprocess isgenerally performed cold, but itis
difficult toclassify itstrictly asacold-working process because con-
siderable heating results from thehigh-speed deformation. Impact
extrusion processes arerestricted tothesofter metals such aslead, tin,
aluminum, andcopper.
20-2. Extrusion Equipment
Most extrusions aremade with hydraulic presses. Hydraulic extru-
sionpresses areclassified intohorizontal andvertical presses, depending
upon thedirection oftravel oftheram. Vertical extrusion presses are
generally built with capacities of300to1,000 tons. They have the
advantages ofeasier alignment between thepressramandthetools,
higher rate ofproduction, andtheneed forless floor space than hori-
zontal presses. However, theyneed considerable headroom, andtomake
extrusions ofappreciable length, afloor pit isfrequently necessary.
Vertical presses willproduce uniform cooling ofthe billet inthecon-
tainer, andthus symmetrically uniform deformation will result. Ina
horizontal extrusion press thebottom ofthebillet which liesincontact
with thecontainer willcoolmore rapidly than thetopsurface, unless the
extrusion container isinternally heated, andtherefore thedeformation
willbenonuniform. Warping ofbars will result, andnonuniform wall
thickness willoccur intubes. Incommercial operations thechief use
forvertical presses isintheproduction ofthin-wall tubing, where uni-
form wall thickness andconcentricity arerequired. Horizontal extru-
sion presses areused formost commercial extrusion ofbarsandtubes.
Presses with acapacity of1,500 to5,000 tons areinregular operation,
while afewpresses of12,000-ton capacity havebeen constructed.
The diesandtooling used inextrusion must withstand considerable
abuse from thehigh stresses, thermal shock, and oxidation. Highly
alloyed tool steels areused toprovide tough diesandtools withadequate
elevated-temperature strength. Figure 20-4 illustrates themain features
ofasimple die,such aswould beused forextruding bars. The dieillus-
trated isaflatorsquare diewith a90°half-die angle. Thistype ofdie
iscommonly used, but itdoes notrepresent theoptimum condition for
allmetals. Theoptimum dieangle isacompromise which provides the
lowest extrusion pressure with thelongest die life. Half-die angles down
to45°areusedwith conical dies,depending ontheflow characteristics

20-3. Variables inExtrusion
The principal variables which influence theforce required tocause
extrusion are(1)thetype ofextrusion (direct vs.indirect), (2)theextru-
sion ratio, (3)theworking temperature, (4)thespeed ofdeformation, and
(5)thefrictional conditions atthedie
andcontainer wall.
InFig. 20-5 theextrusion pres-
sure isplotted against ram travel for
direct andindirect extrusion. Extru-
sion pressure istheextrusion force
divided bythecross-sectional area
ofthe billet. Therapid riseinpres-
sureduring the initial ram travel is
duetothe initial compression ofthe
billet to filltheextrusion container.
Fordirect extrusion themetal begins

mum value ofpressure. Asthe

progressively decreases asthefrictional forces decrease with decreasing
length ofthebillet inthecontainer. Forindirect extrusion there isno
relative motion between the billet andthecontainer wall. Therefore,

Thecurve fordirect extrusion approaches thecurve forindirect extrusion

thethin disk ofthe billet which remains inthe die. Itisgenerally
uneconomical todevelop enough pressure toforce the billet completely
through thedie,andtherefore asmall discard, orbutt,must beremoved

thelength ofthebilletandtheeffectiveness oflubrication atthebillet-
container interface.
Extrusion ratio istheratio ofthe initial cross-sectional area tothe
cross-sectional area after extrusion, R=Ao/Af. The extrusion pres-

If(Toistaken astheuniaxial flow stress attheconditions oftemperature
andstrain rateusedduring extrusion, Eq.(20-1) willpredict anextrusion
forcewhich isatleast50percentlower than theobserved extrusion force.
This isbecause Eq.(20-1) doesnottake intoconsideration such factors as
nonhomogeneous deformation ofthe billet (which results inredundant
work), diefriction, andfriction between thebilletandthecontainer (for
direct extrusion). Acomplete analytical treatment ofthese factors is
difficult, which prevents theaccurate calculation ofextrusion forceand
extrusion pressure.^ Frequently theeffective flow stress, orextrusion
constant, iscalculated foranextrusion operation from theobserved
breakthrough pressure andtheextrusion ratio using Eq. (20-1).

increased from 95to99percent. Thiscorresponds toachange inextru-
sion ratiofrom 20to100. Easily extruded metals likebrassandalumi-
num canbeworked atextrusion ratios greater than 100,while metals
more difficult toextrude likenickel-base high-temperature alloys are
limited toextrusion ratios ofaround 20.
Most metals areextruded hotsoastotakeadvantage ofthedecrease
inflow stress ordeformation resistance with increasing temperature.
Since hotworking introduces theproblems ofoxidation ofthebilletand
theextrusion toolsandsoftening ofthedieand tools, aswellasmaking it
more difficult toprovide adequate lubrication, itisadvantageous touse
theminimum temperature which willprovide themetal with suitable
plasticity. Theupper hot-working temperature isthetemperature at
which hotshortness occurs, or,forpure metals, themelting point.
Because oftheextensive deformation produced inextrusion, considerable
internal heating ofthemetal also results. Therefore, thetopworking
temperature should besafely below themelting-point orhot-shortness
range. Foragiven deformation, higher working temperatures aregener-
allypossible with extrusion thancanbeused inforging orrolling because
thehighcompressive stresses minimize cracking. However, cracking in
extrusions ofunsymmetrical shapemayoccur because ofunequal flow in
different sections.
Increasing theramspeed produces anincrease intheextrusion pres-
sure.Atenfold increase inthespeed results inabout a50percent
increase inpressure. Greater cooling ofthebillet occurs atlowextrusion
speeds. When thisbecomes pronounced, thepressure required fordirect
extrusion willactually increase with increasing ramtravel because ofthe
increased flow stress asthebillet cools. Thehigher thetemperature of
thebillet, thegreater theeffect oflowextrusion speed onthecooling of
the billet. Therefore, high extrusion speeds arerequired with high-
strength alloys thatneedhighextrusion temperatures. Thetemperature
riseduetodeformation ofthemetal isgreater athigh extrusion speeds,
andtherefore problems withhotshortness maybeaccentuated.^
The selection oftheproper extrusion speed andtemperature isbest
determined bytrialanderror foreach alloyand billet size. The inter-
dependence ofthese factors isshown schematically inFig. 20-6. Fora
given extrusion pressure, theextrusion ratio which canbeobtained
increases with increasing temperature. Foranygiven temperature a
larger extrusion ratio canbeobtained with ahigher pressure. The
maximum billet temperature, ontheassumption that there arenolimi-
tations from thestrength ofthetoolsand die, isdetermined bythe
temperature atwhich incipient melting orhotshortness occurs inthe

Therefore, thecurve which represents theupper limit tothesafeextru-

Although flatdieswith a90°half-die angle areused formost extrusion,
experiments^ onextrusion through wedge-shaped dieshave showni that
the extrusion pressure decreases with decreasing dieangle. More
uniform deformation ofthemetal results with small-angle dies. Addi-
tional control over thedeformation canbeobtained bychanging the
length ofthebearing section inthe die.Anincreased bearing length
results ingreater friction, andhence greater pressure isrequired tomain-
taintheflow. Careful adjustment ofthebearing length isused tomake
theflowthrough irregular-shaped diesmore uniform.
Lubrication ofextrusion diesandcontainers isoften rather difficult.
Graphite dispersions areused inextruding copper andnickel-base alloys.

Ifeffective lubrication canbeobtained, anappreciable increase inthe
allowable extrusion ratio foragiven capacity press canbesecured. In
addition, higher extrusion speeds arepossible with lubrication because
lessheat isproduced. Also, foragiven extrusion ratio theloads onthe
tooling willbelower with effective lubrication. Anoutstanding example
oftheeffectiveness oflubrication istheuseofglass intheUgine-Sejournet

Sec. 20-41 Extrusion 523
20-7a represents theextrusion ofawell-lubricated billet inwhich the
billet slides along thecontainer wall. Deformation inthebillet isrela-
tively uniform until close tothedieentrance. Here thecenter part of
the billetmoves more easily through thediethan themetal along the
container wall. Atthecorners ofthediethere isadead zone ofstagnant
metal which undergoes little deformation. Elements atthecenter ofthe
billet undergo essentially pure elongation intheextruded rod,which
corresponds tothechange incross section from billet toextrusion. Ele-
ments near thesides ofthebillet undergo extensive shear deformation.
Theshear deformation which occurs overmuch ofthecross section ofthe
extruded rodrequires anexpenditure ofenergy which isnotrelated to
thechange indimensions from thebillet totheextrusion. Thisredundant
work ischiefly responsible forthelarge discrepancy between theactual
extrusion pressure andtheextrusion pressure calculated onthebasis of
ideal deformation.
Ifthere ishigh friction between the billet andthecontainer wall,
severe shear deformation willoccur inthe billet aswell asintheflow
ofthemetal through thedie(Fig. 20-76). Since thevelocity ofthe
metal atthecenter ofthebillet ishigher than along thecontainer wall,
there isatendency formetal topileupalong thewallandeventually it
willmove toward thecenter ofthebillet. This gives risetotheextrusion
defect. Alternatively, iftheshear resistance ofthemetal along thecon-
tainer wall islower than thefrictional stress, themetal willseparate along
thisregion andathin skin ofmetal willbeleftinthecontainer.

bychanging thedieangle. Decreasing thedieangle ofaconical dieso

results from smaller-angle dies, thefriction forces arehigher. Therefore,
itdoesnotnecessarily follow that theextrusion pressure islowerwhen
thedeformation ismore uniform.
Inindirect extrusion there isnofriction between the billet andthe
container wall. With aflatdieadeadmetal zone exists, asinFig.20-7a,

dead metal zoneand result inagood approximation toobserved defor-
mation patterns.
20-5. Extrusion Defects
Because oftheinhomogeneous deformation inthedirect extrusion ofa
billet, thecenter ofthe billet moves faster than theperiphery. Asa
result, thedead metal zoneextends down along theouter surface ofthe
billet. After about two-thirds ofthebillet isextruded, theouter surface
ofthebilletmoves toward thecenter andextrudes through thedienear
theaxis oftherod. Since thesurface ofthe billet often contains an
oxidized skin, thistype offlow results ininternal oxide stringers. This
defect canbeconsidered tobeaninternal pipe,and itisknown asthe
extrusion defect. Onatransverse section through theextrusion this will
appear asanannular ring ofoxide. Thetendency toward theformation
oftheextrusion defect increases asthecontainer wall friction becomes
greater. Ifaheated billet isplaced inacooler extrusion container, the
outer layers ofthe billet willbechilled andtheflow resistance ofthis
region willincrease. Therefore, there willbeagreater tendency forthe
center part ofthebillet toextrude before thesurface skin,andthetend-
ency forformation oftheextrusion defect isincreased.
Oneway ofavoiding theextrusion defect istocarry outtheextrusion
operation only tothepointwhere thesurface oxide begins toenter thedie
andthen discard theremainder ofthe billet. Thisprocedure mayhave
serious economic consequences since asmuch as30percent ofthebillet
mayremain atthepoint where theextrusion defect isencountered. An
alternative procedure, which isfrequently applied intheextrusion of
brass, istouseadummy block which isslightly smaller than theinside
diameter oftheextrusion container. Astherampushes thedummy
block forward, itscalps thebilletandtheoxidized surface layer remains
inthecontainer. Asimilar remedy, which isusedwith nickel andhigh-
temperature alloys, istomachine theoxidized skinfrom thebillet before
placing itintheextrusion container. Forthisprocedure tobesuccess-
ful,the billet should notoxidize when itisheated totheextrusion
temperature.
Because ofthenature ofthemetal flow inindirect extrusion, theoxi-
dized surface ofthebillet builds uponthesurface oftheextrusion. This
isknown asexternal pipeandcanbeeliminated byscalping the billet
with adummy block which issmaller than theinside diameter ofthe
container.
When extrusion iscarried tothepoint atwhich thelength ofbillet
remaining inthecontainer isabout one-quarter itsdiameter, therapid
radial flow intothedieresults inthecreation ofanaxial hole, orfunnel,

Sec.20-6] Extrusion 525
inthebackend oftheextrusion. This holemayextend forsome dis-
tance intothebackendoftheextrusion, andtherefore thismetal must be
discarded. Thelength ofthis defect canbereduced considerably by
inclining theface oftheramatan
angle totheram axis.^
Surface cracking canresult from
extruding attoorapid arateorat
toohighatemperature. Asevere
form ofsurface serrations, called
the "fir-tree defect," results from
themomentary sticking ofthe
extrusion inthe dieland. The
pressure builds uprapidly asthe
metal tries toextrude internally to
overcome thehigh friction atthe
diewall.
Because ofthenonuniform de-
formation produced inextrusion
there willbeconsiderable variation
instructure and properties from
thefront tothebackendoftheextrusion inthelongitudinal direction and
across thediameter oftheextrusion inthetransverse direction. The first
metal through thediereceives lessdeformation than theremainder ofthe
extrusion. Therefore, thestrength inthisregion willbelower. The
variation instrength along thelength oftheextrusion depends onthe
extrusion ratio inthemanner shown inFig. 20-8. Forthecommercial
range ofextrusion ratios there islittle variation inlongitudinal strength
beyond thefrontendoftheextrusion. Theindirect-extrusion process is
particularly effective inproducing uniform working inthelongitudinal
direction.
Because ofthesevere shear deformation inthesurface layers ofthe
extrusion, thisregion ismore highly deformed than thecenter. There-
fore, iftheextrusion isheated after itleaves thepress, thesurface layers
willgenerally respond differently from theinterior. One result canbe
formation oflarge grains inthesurface layerwhen theextrusion is
recrystallized.50

20-9. Production ofSeamless PipeandTubing
Pipeandtubing maybeclassified asseamless orwelded, depending on
themethod ofmanufacture. Extrusion isanexcellent method ofpro-
ducing seamless pipeandtubing, particularly formetals which are diffi-
cult towork. However, there areother well-established processes for
producing seamless pipeandtubing which aregenerally more economical
than extrusion.
TheMannesmann mill (Fig. 20-lla) isused intherotary piercing of
steelandcopper billets fortheproduction ofseamless pipeandtubes.
Rotary piercing takes advantage ofthefactthat tensile stresses aredevel-
oped atthecenter ofabarwhen itissubjected toforces around its
periphery. Intheoperation oftheMannesmann millaheated cylindri-
calbillet isplaced between rotating rollswhich, inthehorizontal plane,
areinclined atanangle. Guide rolls (notshown inFig.20-lla) prevent
the billet from dropping through thework rolls inthevertical plane.
Because thework rolls aresetatanangle toeach other, the billet is

ROD, WIRE,ANDTUBEDRAWING
21-1. Introduction
Drawing operations involve theforcing ofmetal through adieby
means ofatensile force applied totheexitside ofthedie.Most ofthe
plastic flow iscaused bycompression forcewhich arises from thereaction
ofthemetal with thedie. Usually themetal hasacircular symmetry,
butthis isnotanabsolute requirement. Thereduction indiameter of
asolid barorrodbysuccessive drawing isknown ashar, rod,orwire
drawing, depending onthediameter ofthefinalproduct. When ahollow
tube isdrawn through adiewithout anymandrel tosupport theinside
ofthetube, this isknown astubesinking. When amandrel orplug is
used tosupport theinside diameter ofthetube asitisdrawn through a
die,theprocess iscalled tubedrawing. Bar, wire,andtubedrawing are
usually carried outatroom temperature. However, because large defor-
mations areusually involved, there isconsiderable temperature risedur-
ingthedrawing operation.
21-2. RodandWire Drawing
The principles involved inthedrawing ofbars, rod,andwire are
basically thesame, although theequipment that isused isdifferent for
thedifferent-sized products. Rods andtubes, which cannot becoiled,
areproduced ondrawbenches (Fig. 21-la). Therod ispointed with a
swager, inserted through thedie,andclamped tothejaws ofthedraw-
head. Thedrawhead ismoved either byachain drive orbyahydraulic
mechanism. Drawbenches with 300,000 lbpulland100 ftofrunout are
available. Draw speeds varyfromabout 30to300ft/min.

diameter theamount ofshear deformation inthedirection opposite to
thedraw pull increases with increasing half-die angle. Only the ele-
ments ontheaxis ofthebarundergo pure elongation. Forlarge die
angles thelarge shear deformation results inanincreased longitudinal
tensile stress atthecenter ofthewirewhich canexceed thefracture stress
andcanthereby result inthecupping type offailure. Foragiven die
angle theshear deformation becomes lessimportant with increasing per-
centage reductions. Forthisreason, theoretical treatments ofwiredraw-
ingwhich neglect thenonuniform deformation have greater validity at
high reductions. Because oftheincreased surface shear deformation,
theyieldand tensile strengths ofdrawn wires arehigher forlarger die
angles. This effect isgreater forlower reductions.
Although thenonuniform shear deformation islower with smaller die
angles, thewall friction ishigher. Since thedraw force depends ina
complicated wayonthedieangle, reduction, theflow stress, andthe
friction, there willbeanoptimum dieangle which results inthemini-
mum draw force foragiven reduction. Thisoptimum dieangle will
depend onthereduction, thelubrication, andthematerials involved.
Allother factors being constant, theoptimum dieangle increases with
amount ofreduction. Thedrawing speed has little effect onthedraw-
ingforce. However, there isgreater temperature risewithhighdrawing
speeds, andlubrication becomes more difficult.
Another factor toconsider istheexistence ofahack pull inthedirec-
tionopposite tothedraw pull.Aback pull ofconsiderable magnitude
can arisefrom frictional forces acting onthedraw blocks ofmultiple
drawing machines, oritmaybepurposely applied forthereasons given
below. Aback pullmaterially increases thedrawing force. Onthe
other hand, itreduces thewallpressure inthedieandreduces the fric-
tion,andtherefore diewear isappreciably decreased.
21-5. Wire Drawing without Friction
Asimplified theory ofwiredrawing canbedeveloped^ onthebasis of
theassumption thatthemetal flow inaconical diecanberepresented
bytheinward radial flow ofasegment ofasphere. Thepresence of
friction andshear (redundant) deformation isneglected inthisanalysis,
sothat itrepresents theideal situation. InFig. 21-4, theprincipal

Friction occurs ineven thebest-lubricated die,andtherefore itmust
beconsidered intheanalysis oftheforces required forwire drawing.
The friction force atanypoint inthedie isassumed proportional tothe
normal pressure atthat point (Coulomb's
law offriction) andacts inadirection to
oppose relative motion between thedieand
thewire.
Ananalysis which considers theeffect of
friction onthestresses inwiredrawing was

stress isassumed throughout thewire. Fig-

dition which limits themaximum reduction, a^f=<to,willbereached

21-7. Tube-drawing Processes
Hollow cylinders, ortubes, which aremade byhot-forming processes
such asextrusion orpiercing and rolling (seeChap. 20),areoften cold-
finished bydrawing. Colddrawing isused toobtain closer dimensional
tolerances, toproduce better surface finishes, toincrease themechanical
properties ofthetube material bystrain hardening, toproduce tubes
with thinner walls orsmaller diameters than canbeobtained with hot-
forming methods, andtoproduce tubes ofirregular shapes.
Tube drawing isessentially thesame aswiredrawing. Tubes arepro-
duced onadrawbench andwith diessimilar tothose employed inwire
drawing. However, inorder toreduce thewallthickness andaccurately
tocontrol theinside diameter, theinside surface ofthetubemust be
supported while itpasses through thedie. This isusually accomplished
byinserting amandrel, orplug, inside thetube. Themandrel isoften
fastened totheendofastationary rodattached tooneendofthedraw-
bench and ispositioned sothat themandrel islocated inthethroat of
thedie.Themandrel mayhave either acylindrical oratapered cross
section (Fig. 21-6aand b).Tube drawing may beaccomplished also
with amoving mandrel, either bypulling along rodthrough thedie
with thetube (Fig. 21-6c)orbypushing adeep-drawn shellthrough the
diewith apunch (Fig. 2l-Qd). Because ofdifficulties inusing longrods
formandrels, tubedrawing witharodusually islimited totheproduction
ofsmall-sized tubing, where therodsupporting thestationary mandrel
would betoothin tohave adequate strength. Another tube-producing
method istubesinking, inwhich nomandrel isused tosupport theinside
surface ofthetube asitisdrawn through thedie. Since theinside of
thetube isnotsupported intube sinking, thewallthickness willeither
increase ordecrease, depending ontheconditions imposed intheprocess.
Onacommercial basis tube sinking isused only fortheproduction of
small tubes. However, itrepresents animportant problem inplastic-
forming theory because itoccurs asthe firststep intubedrawing with a
mandrel. Inorder that thetubedimensions canbecontrolled bythe

case forwiredrawing andtubedrawing with astationary mandrel.
However, forthecase oftubedrawing with amoving mandrel the
mandrel ismoving with avelocity equal tothat ofthetubeontheexit
side ofthedie,andthis ishigher than thevelocity ofthemetal confined
between thedieandthemandrel. Therefore, there isrelative motion
between themetal inthedieandthemandrel toward theentrance end
ofthe die,andasaresult thefrictional forces aredirected toward the
dieexit. Therefore, thedirection ofthefriction force /2PinFig.21-7

Either positive ornegative values ofB'canbeobtained, depending on

Examination ofthisequation indicates thatwhen B'islessthan—1
theaxial stress willbecompressive; i.e.,themetal isextruded bythe
frictional forces developed between themandrel andtheinner surface

Thedetermination ofthetheoretical maximum reduction perpass for
drawing with amoving mandrel depends upon adifferent criterion from
that forthesituation with astationary mandrel. Because themandrel

undergo circumferential strain. Therefore, aplane-strain condition

Two distinct types ofresidual-stress patterns arefound incold-drawn

perpass oflessthanabout 1percent thelongitudinal residual stresses
arecompressive atthesurface and tensile attheaxis, theradial stresses
aretensile attheaxisanddrop offtozeroatthefreesurface, while the
circumferential stresses follow thesame trend asthelongitudinal residual
stresses. Forlarger reductions ofcommercial significance theresidual-
stress distribution iscompletely reversed from the firsttype ofstress
pattern. Inthiscasethelongitudinal stresses aretensile atthesurface
andcompressive attheaxis oftherod,theradial stresses arecompressive
attheaxis,andthecircumferential stresses follow thesame pattern as
thelongitudinal stresses. The firsttype ofresidual-stress pattern is
characteristic offorming operations where thedeformation islocalized
inthesurface layers.
The effect ofdieangle andtheamount ofreduction perpassonthe
longitudinal residual stress incold-drawn brass wirewasinvestigated by
Linicus andSachs.^Figure 21-9shows that foragiven reduction the
longitudinal residual stress increases with thehalf-die angle. Maximum
values ofresidual stress areobtained forreductions intheregion of
15to35percent.
Fortubes produced bytube sinking, under conditions where thedefor-
mation isrelatively uniform throughout thetube wall, thelongitudinal
residual stresses aretensile ontheouter surface andcompressive onthe
inner surface ofthetube. The residual stresses inthecircumferential
direction follow thesame pattern, while thestresses intheradial direc-
tionarenegligible. Approximate measurements^ ofthecircumferential
stresses ontheouter surface ofsunk tubes indicate that thestresses
increase with increasing reduction indiameter atthesame rateatwhich

SHEET-METAL FORMING
22-1. Introduction
The ability toproduce avariety ofshapes from flatsheets ofmetal at
high rates ofproduction hasbeenoneoftherealtechnological advances
ofthetwentieth century. This transition fromhand-forming operations
tomass-production methods hasbeenanimportant factor inthegreat
improvement inthestandard ofliving which occurred during theperiod.
Inessence, ashape isproduced from aflatblank bystretching and
shrinking thedimensions ofallitsvolume elements inthethree mutually
perpendicular principal directions. Theresulting shape isthentheresult
oftheintegration ofallthelocal stretching andshrinking ofthevolume
elements. Attempts have beenmade toclassify thealmost limitless
number ofshapes which arepossible inmetal forming into definite
categories depending upon thecontour ofthefinished part. Sachs^ has
classified sheet-metal parts into fivecategories.
1.Singly curved parts
2.Contoured flanged parts—including parts with stretch flanges and
shrink flanges
3.Curved sections
4.Deep-recessed parts—including cupsandboxes with either vertical
orsloping walls
5.Shallow-recessed parts—including dish-shaped, beaded, embossed,
andcorrugated parts
Typical examples ofthese parts areshown inFig. 22-1. Another
classification system, developed intheautomotive industry, groups sheet-
steel parts intocategories depending ontheseverity oftheforming oper-
ation. ^Severity oftheoperation isbased onthemaximum amount of
bending orstretching inthepart.

Stillanother way ofclassifying sheet-metal forming isbymeans of
specific operations such asbending, shearing, deep drawing, stretching,
ironing, etc.Most ofthese operations have been illustrated briefly in
Fig. 17-1,andthey willbediscussed inconsiderably greater detail inthis
chapter.
22-2. Forming Methods
Theoldmethod ofhand forming ofsheet metal istoday usedprimarily
asafinishing operation toremove wrinkles leftbyforming machines. In
themetalworking industries hand forming isprimarily limited toexperi-
mental work where only afewidentical pieces arerequired.
Most high-production-volume sheet-metal forming isdoneonapress,
driven either bymechanical orbyhydraulic action. Inmechanical
presses energy isgenerally stored inaflywheel and istransferred tothe

)ec.22-2] Sheet-metal Formins 551
movable slideonthedownstroke ofthepress. Mechanical presses are
usually quick-acting andhave ashort stroke, while hydraulic presses are
slower-acting butcanapply alonger stroke. Presses areusually classified
according tothenumber ofslides which canbeoperated independently
ofeach other. Inthesingle-action press there isonlyone slide, generally
operating inthevertical direction. Inthedouble-action press there are
two slides. Thesecond action isordinarily used tooperate thehold-
down, which prevents wrinkling indeep drawing. Atriple-action press is
equipped withtwoactions above thedieandoneaction below thedie.
Thebasic tools usedwith ametalworking press arethepunch andthe
die.^ Thepunch istheconvex male toolwhich mates with theconcave
female die. Generally thepunch isthemoving element. Because accu-
ratealignment between thepunch anddie isusually required, itiscom-
mon practice tomount them permanently inasubpress, ordieset,which
canbequickly inserted inthepress. Animportant consideration in
tooling forsheet-metal forming isthefrequent requirement foraclamp-
ingpressure, orhold-down, toprevent wrinkling ofthesheet asitisbeing
formed. Hold-down canbebestprovided byahold-down ring,which is
actuated bythesecond action ofadouble-action press. However, by
using mechanical springs oranauxiliary aircylinder hold-down canbe
provided inasingle-action press.
Frequently punches anddiesaredesigned sothat successive stages in
theforming ofthepart arecarried outinthesame dieoneach stroke of
thepress. This isknown asprogressive forming. Asimple example isa
progressive blanking andpiercing dietomake aplain, flatwasher (Fig.
22-2). Asthestrip isfedfrom lefttoright, thehole forthewasher is
firstpunched andthen thewasher isblanked from the strip. Atthe
same time asthewasher isbeing blanked from thestrip, thepunchAis
piercing thehole forthenextwasher. Thestripper plate isused topre-
vent themetal from separating from thedieontheupstroke ofthe

localization ofstrain canresult, under certain circumstances, intheform-

thepart isobtained with wiper-type equipment. Initssimplest form this

Stillathirdmethod ofproducing contours isbywrap forming. Inwrap
forming thesheet iscompressed against aform block, andatthesame
time alongitudinal tensile stress isapplied toprevent buckling and

duce complete shearing isdirectly
related totheductility ofthemetal.
The penetration isonly asmall
fraction ofthesheet thickness for
brittle materials, while forvery
ductile materials itmaybeslightly
greater than thethickness.
Theclearance between theblades
isanimportant variable inshearing
operations. With theproper clear-
ance thecracks that initiate atthe
edges oftheblades willpropagate
through themetal andmeet near
thecenter ofthethickness topro-
vide aclean fracture surface (Fig.
22-6a). Note that even with
proper clearance there isstill dis-
tortion atasheared edge. Insuffi-
cient clearance will produce a
ragged fracture (Fig. 22-66) and
also will require more energy to
shear themetal thanwhen there is
proper clearance. With excessive
clearance there isgreater distortion
oftheedge, andmore energy isre-
quired because more metal must
plastically deform before itfrac-
tures. Furthermore, with toolarge aclearance, burrs orsharp pro-
jections arelikely toform onthesheared edge (Fig. 22-6c). Adull
cutting edge alsoincreases thetendency fortheformation ofburrs. The
amount ofplastic deformation thatcanbewithstood inbrittle metals

therefore theclearance should besmall forhardand brittle metals. On
theother hand, soft, ductile metals require extensive plastic deformation
before fracture, andtherefore theclearance must belarger.
Neglecting friction, theforce required toshear ametal sheet isthe
product ofthelength ofcut,thesheet thickness, andtheshearing strength
ofthemetal. Theshearing force canbereduced appreciably bymaking
theedges ofthecutting tool ataninclined angle (Fig. 22-7), sothat
only ashort part ofthetotal length ofcut ismade atonetime. The
inclination ofthecutting edge iscalled shear. Theamount ofshear
should beequal tothemetal thickness. Since shear onthetoolpro-
duces some distortion ofthesheet metal incontact with it,theshear
should beapplied tothetoolwhich actsonthescrap. Therefore, in
punching ahole theface ofthepunch should beinclined atanangle,
butwhen blanks arecutfrom thesheet, thedieshould begiven ashear
angle andthepunch should beflat.

Awhole group ofpress operations arebased ontheprocess ofshearing.
Theshearing ofclosed contours, when themetal inside thecontour isthe

carded, then theoperation isknown aspunching, orpiercing. Punching

When metal isbent, itsfinallength isincreased over itsoriginal length
intheblank because themetal thickness isdecreased. Asthebend radius
becomes smaller, thedecrease inthickness increases. The initial ordevel-

strain. Theelementary theory ofthebending ofrectangular beams con-
siders onlythecircumferential strain, which isconsidered tovary only in
thedirection perpendicular tothesurface ofthesheet. However, experi-
ment^ shows that thedistribution ofstrain inbending isconsiderably
more complicated. The circum-
ferential strain distribution de-
pends significantly onthemethod
ofbending. Three-point bending
inadieproduces rather non-
uniform distribution ofstrain. In
bending bywiping orwrapping the
metal against aform block, the
bend angle increases progressively.
However, since thedistribution of
circumferential strain inthe cir-
cumferential direction becomes
uniform only after thebend angle
exceeds aminimum value ofabout
90°,thestrain introduced bythese
bending methods isnotuniform until appreciable deformation hasbeen
produced. Thedistribution ofcircumferential strain eiacross thewidth
isquite uniform except attheedges, where itisabout 20percenthigher
than atthecenter. This isexplained bythefactthataninitially rec-
tangular cross section isdistorted intoatrapezoidal cross section with
curled edges during bending. The distribution ofthetransverse strain
€2isusually rather nonuniform. Since thestress normal toafreesurface
isalways zero, theedges ofabentspecimen aresubjected touniaxial
tension. Therefore, because ofthePoisson effect atransverse compres-
sive strain issetup.Thetransverse compressive strain decreases with
distance infrom theedge inthetransverse direction. Iftheratio of
width tothickness isgreater than 8,thetransverse strain atthecenter of
thewidth ofthesheet isequal to0.Because ofthisthetransverse strain

Experiments show thatthecircumferential strain onthetension surface
isconsiderably greater than thatgiven byEq.(22-2) forlarge values of

from thestrain predicted bythesimplified equation.
Foragiven bending operation thebend radius cannot bemade smaller
than acertain value, orthemetal willcrack ontheouter tensile surface.
Theminimum bend radius isusually expressed inmultiples ofthesheet
thickness. Thus, a3Tbend radius indicates thatthemetal canbebent
without cracking through aradius equal tothree times thesheet thick-
ness. Therefore, theminimum bend radius isaforming limit. Itvaries
considerably between different metals andalways increases with cold
working. Although some very ductile metals have aminimum bend

Itresults from thechanges instrain produced byelastic recovery (Fig.

22-5. Stretch Forming
Stretch forming istheprocess offoriqaing bytheapplication ofpri-
marily tensile forces insuchaway astostretch thematerial overatool
orform block.^Theprocess isanoutgrowth ofthestretcher leveling of
rolled sheet. Stretch forming isusedmost extensively intheaircraft
industry toproduce parts oflarge radius ofcurvature, frequently with
double curvature. Animportant consideration isthat springback is
largely eliminated instretch forming because thestress gradient isrela-
tively uniform. Ontheother hand, because tensile stresses predominate,
large deformations canbeobtained bythisprocess only inmaterials with
appreciable ductility.
Stretch-forming equipment consists basically ofahydraulically driven
ram (usually vertical) which carries thepunch orform block andtwo
jaws forgripping theends ofthesheet (Fig. 22-13). Nofemale die is
used instretch forming. The gripsmaybepivoted, sothatthetension
force isalways inlinewith theedge oftheunsupported sheet, orthey
canbefixed, inwhich casealarge radius isneeded toprevent tearing
thesheet atthejaws. Inusing astretch-forming machine thesheet-
metal blank isfirstbent ordraped around theform block with relatively
light tensile pull,thegrips areapplied, andthestretching load isincreased
until theblank isstrained plastically tofinal shape. This differs from
wrap forming (Sec. 22-2) inthat inthelatter process theblank isfirst
gripped andthen while stillstraight isloaded totheelastic limit before
wrapping around theform block.

lessthan theuniform elongation. Themain type offailure istearing of
thesheet atthelocation ofthemaximum stretch. Inparts with large
radius ofcurvature, failure usually occurs between thejawsandtheform
block, but insharply curved parts thetearing occurs midway between
thejaws. Edge cracking willoccur insheet withsheared edges, andthis
willdecrease appreciably theallowable stretch. Another forming defect
istheoccurrence ofwrinkles duetobuckling ofthesheet. Thetendency
toform wrinkles increases with increasing width anddecreasing thick-
ness, increasing radius ofcurvature, andincreasing strength ofthemetal.

intocup-shaped articles such asbathtubs, shell cases, andautomobile

against thedietoprevent wrinkling. This isbestdonebymeans ofa
blank holder orhold-down ring inadouble-action press. Although the
factors which control thedeep-drawing process arequite evident, they
interact insuch acomplex way that precise mathematical description
oftheprocess isnotpossible insimple terms. The greatest amount
ofexperimental and analytical work hasbeen done onthedeep
drawing ofacylindrical cupfrom aflatcircular blank. Thediscussion
ofdeepdrawing which follows willbelimited tothisrelatively simple
situation.
Inthedeepdrawing ofacupthemetal issubjected tothree different
types ofdeformations. Figure 22-15 represents thedeformation and

deep drawing. Themetal atthecenter oftheblank under thehead of
thepunch iswrapped around theprofile ofthepunch, andinsodoing it
isthinned down. Themetal inthisregion issubjected tobiaxial tensile
stress duetotheaction ofthepunch. Metal intheouter portion ofthe
blank isdrawn radially inward toward thethroat ofthe die.Asitis
drawn in,theouter circumference must continuously decrease from that
oftheoriginal blank, ttDq, tothat ofthefinished cup, -n-Dp. Thismeans
that itissubjected toacompressive strain inthecircumferential, orhoop,
direction andatensile strain intheradial direction. Asaresult ofthese
twoprincipal strains there isacontinual increase inthethickness asthe

jected toatensile stress. This plastic bending under tension results in
considerable thinning, which modifies thethickening duetothecircumfer-
ential shrinking. Between theinner stretched zoneandtheouter shrunk
zone there isanarrow ring ofmetal which hasnotbeen bentover either
thepunch orthedie.Themetal inthisregion issubjected only tosimple
tensile loading throughout thedrawing operation.
The resulting thickness changes depend onthetotal reduction from
blank tocupandthepunch and die radii. Generally, thegreatest
increase inthickness occurs attheouter edge ofthecup,where onlya
circumferential compression acts. From theconstancy-of-volume rela-
tionship itcanbeshown that thethickness attheouter edge after cup-
ping, h,isrelated totheoriginal thickness andblank diameter bythe
simple relationship h=hoiDo/D)''-. Thegreatest decrease inthickness

This occurs forlarge reductions andsmall values ofpunch radius.
Iftheclearance between thepunch andthedie islessthan thethick-
nessproduced byfree thickening, themetal inthese regions willbe
squeezed, orironed, between thepunch andthedietoproduce auniform
wall thickness. Incommercial deepdrawing clearances about 10to20
percent greater than themetal thickness arecommon. Ironing oper-
ations inwhich appreciable uniform reductions aremade inthewall
thickness usemuch smaller clearances.
The force onthepunch required toproduce acup isthesummation
oftheideal force ofdeformation, thefrictional forces, andtheforce
required toproduce ironing (ifpresent). Figure 22-16 illustrates the
way inwhich these components ofthetotalpunch force vary with the
length ofstroke ofthepunch. The ideal force ofdeformation increases
continuously with length oftravel because thestrain isincreasing and

566 Plastic Forming ofMetals [Chap. 22
theflow stress isincreasing owing tostrain hardening. Amajor con-
tribution tothefriction forcecomes from thehold-down pressure. This
forcecomponent peaks earlyanddecreases with increasing travel because
thearea oftheblank under thehold-down ring iscontinually decreasing.
A.ny force required toproduce ironing occurs late intheprocess after the

Forasuccessful drawing operation thepunch loaddetermined byEq.

influence onthepunch loadandthecupstrength asthestrength ofthe
metal and itscross-sectional area.
Thedrawability ofametal isrelated primarily totheratio oftheinitial
blank diameter tothepunch diameter, Do/Dp. Depending upon geo-
metrical factors, thisdraw ratio will fallwithin thelimits 1.6to2.3.
Thepunch load increases approximately linearly with initial blank diam-
eter. Other important factors which influence thedrawability arethe

There isnoadvantage inincreasing thedieradius much above thislimit
because theincreased radius results inanappreciable unsupported area
under thehold-down ring,andbuckling may occur. Foradieradius

Theclearance between thepunch andthediedetermines theamount

operations ironing does notaffect themaximum punch loadbecause it
occurs late intheprocess after thepunch loadhasstarted todecrease.
Unless theblank iscomparatively thickandthedraw ratio small, itis
necessary tousehold-down pressure toprevent theformation ofradial
wrinkles intheouter region oftheblank. Thewrinkles areproduced by
thebuckling ofthethinsheet under theaction ofthecompressive circum-
ferential stresses. Itisimportant toprevent theformation ofwrinkles,
since once theyhave formed they arealmost impossible toiron out.

Sachs' suggests that thehold-down pressure should bebetween one-
fiftieth andonetwo-hundredth thesum oftheyield strength andtensile
strength ofthesheet metal.
Frictional forces occur between theblank andthehold-down ring,
around thedieradius, andbetween thepunch andthedie.Anappreci-
able reduction inthepunch load, andhence anincrease inthedraw-
ability, canbeobtained byapplying lubricants tothedieside ofthe
blank. Lubricating thepunchmay actually reduce drawability^ because
itredistributes alarge percentage ofthedrawing force tothecenter of
thebase ofthecup,where thecross-sectional area issmall.
22-7. Redrawing Operations
Thereduction obtained inasingle draw isgiven by
Doq= 1 (22-9)
Theaverage maximum reduction isabout 50percent,andevenunder the
most favorable conditions theobtainable reduction inasingle draw does
notexceed 60percent. Therefore, even under such conditions, itis
impossible inasingle drawing operation toproduce acupthat ismuch
higher than itsdiameter. Tomake tall,slender cups, such ascartridge
cases andclosed-end tubes, itisnecessary tousesuccessive drawing
operations. Reducing acupordrawn part toasmaller diameter and
increased height isknown asredrawing.
Thetwobasic methods ofredrawing aredirect, orregular, redrawing
and reverse, orindirect, redrawing (Fig. 22-17). Indirect redrawing the

original outside surface ofthecupremains theoutside surface ofthe
redrawn cup. Figure 22-17a illustrates direct redrawing bymeans ofa
hold-down ring. Note that themetal must bend twice andthat itis
bentandunbent atthepunch anddieradii. Thehigh strain hardening
that isencountered intheprocess shown inFig.22-17a isreduced some-
whatbythedesign shown inFig.22-175. Although themetal stillgoes
through thesamenumber ofbends, theangle through which itbends is
lessthan 90°andthepunch load isreduced. Thedisadvantage ofthe
design shown inFig.22-176 isthat thefirst-stage drawn cupmust be
made with atapered corner. This type ofdrawn cupcannot bepro-
duced inallmetals without buckling. Thethickness ofthehold-down
ringused indirect redrawing isdetermined bythepercentage reduction
oftheredraw. Forsmall reductions ahold-down ringcannot beused.
Inreverse redrawing (Fig. 22-17c)thecup isturned inside outsothat
theoutside surface ofthedrawn cupbecomes theinside surface ofthe
redrawn shell. Thebending isalways inthesame direction, rather than
inopposite directions asfordirect redrawing, andtherefore there isless
strain hardening ofthewalls ofthe shell. Better control ofwrinkling
canbeobtained inreverse redrawing because ofthesnug control ofthe
metal around thedieradius andthefactthat there arenogeometrical
limitations totheuseofahold-down ring. Although theforces required
toovercome thebending resistance arelower forreverse redrawing, this
doesnotnecessarily mean that thismethod always requires alowerpunch
loadthan direct redrawing. With reverse redrawing there isobviously
aminimum reduction determined bythethickness ofthedieneeded to
provide adequate strength. Forreductions somewhat larger than the
minimum thedesign limitations dictated bydiestrength favor direct
redrawing because amore generous dieradius canbeused.
Thereduction obtained byredrawing isalways lessthan that obtain-
ableonthe initial draw because ofthehigher friction inherent inthe
redrawing process. Generally thereduction isdecreased foreach suc-
cessive redrawing operation toallow forstrain hardening. Greater reduc-
tions are,ofcourse, possible ifannealing iscarried outbetween redraws.
Most metals willpermit atotal reduction of50to80percent before
annealing.
22-8. ironins andSinking
Redrawing operations may alsobeclassified intodrawing with appreci-
able decrease inwall thickness, called ironing, anddrawing with little
change inwallthickness, called sinking. Theironing process isbasically
thesame astubedrawing with amoving mandrel (Sec. 21-10). The
predominant stress inironing istheradial compressive stress developed

570 Plastic Forming ofMetals [Chap. 22
bythepressure ofthepunch andthedie.Redrawing without reduction
inwall thickness isbasically thesame astube sinking ortubedrawing
without amandrel (Sec. 21-8). Thepredominant stresses areanaxial
tensile stress from theaction ofthepunch andacircumferential com-
pression from thedrawing inofthemetal.
Ironing isaccomplished byrestricting theclearance between thepunch
andthediesothatthewallthickness isthinned outbyaradial pressure.

Thesimpler case oftheironing ofacupwith athinbottom isshown in
Fig. 22-186. The first step isthesinking ofthecuponto thepunch.
When thepunch comes incontact with theinside wall ofthepart, arapid
decrease inthewall thickness begins andthedeformation force rises
rapidly. Asthepart begins toemerge from thedie, thisforce reaches
itsmaximum value.
According toSachs, themaximum force required todeform thebottom

22-9. Defects inFormed Parts
Theultimate defect inaformed sheet-metal part isthedevelopment
ofacrack which destroys itsstructural integrity. Theusefulness ofthe
partmay alsobedestroyed bylocal necking orthinning orbybuckling
andwrinkling inregions ofcompressive stress. Another troublesome
defect isthe failure tomaintain dimensional tolerances because of
springback.
Inthedeepdrawing ofacupthemostcommon failure istheseparation
ofthebottom from therestofthecupatthelocation ofgreatest thinning
nearthepunch radius. This defectmaybeminimized either byreducing
thethinning byusing alarger punch radius orbydecreasing thepunch
load required forthedrawing operation. Ifradial cracks occur inthe
flange ortheedge ofthecup, thisindicates thatthemetal doesnothave
sufficient ductility towithstand thelargeamount ofcircumferential
shrinking that isrequired inthisregion oftheblank. Thistype offail-
ure ismore likely tooccur inredrawing without annealing thanonthe
initial draw.

572 Plastic Forming ofMetals [Chap. 22
Wrinkling oftheflange ortheedges ofthecupresults from buckling
ofthesheet asaresult ofthehigh circumferential compressive stresses.
Inanalyzing thistype offailure eachelement inthesheet canbecon-
sidered asacolumn loaded incompression. Iftheblank diameter istoo
large, thepunch load will risetohigh values, which may exceed the
critical buckling load ofthecolumn. Since column stability decreases
withanincreasing slenderness ratio, the critical buckling load willbe
achieved atlower loads forthin sheet. Toprevent thisdefect, itisneces-
sary tousesufficient hold-down pressure tosuppress thebuckling.
Since sheet-metal formed parts usually present alarge surface area,
they areparticularly susceptible tosurface blemishes which detract from

theappearance ofthepart. Pronounced surface roughness inregions of
thepartwhich haveundergone appreciable deformation isusually called
orange peeling. Theorange-peel effect occurs insheet metal ofrelatively
large grain size. Itresults from thefactthattheindividual grains tend
todeform independently ofeach other, andtherefore thegrains stand out
inrelief onthesurface. This condition isbestcorrected byusing finer-
grain-size sheet metal sothatthegrains deform more nearly asawhole
andtheindividual grains aredifficult todistinguish with theeye.
Another serious surface defect that iscommonly found inlow-carbon
sheet steel isthepresence ofstretcher strains, or"worms." This defect
shows upasaflamelike pattern ofdepressions inthesurface (Fig. 22-19).

Sec.22-9] Sheet-metal Forming 573
The (l(>i)icssi()ii,s (irstappear along planes ofmaximum shear stress, and
then, asderorni.'ilion continues, theyspread andjointogether toproduce
auniforin rough surface. Theexistence ofstretcher strains isdirectly
associated with thepresence ofayield point inthestress-strain curve
andthenonuniform deformation which results from theyield-point elon-
gation (Fig. 22-20). Themetal inthestretcher strains hasbeen strained
anamount equal toBinFig. 22-20, while theremaining metal has
received essentially zero strain. Theelongation ofthepart isgiven by
some intermediate strain A.Asthedeformation continues andthenum-
berofstretcher strains increase, thestrain willincrease untilwhen the
entire part iscovered ithasastrain equal toB.Beyond thisstrain th^
deformation isuniform andhomogeneous. Themain difficulty with
stretcher strains, therefore, occurs inregions ofthepartwhere thestrain

islessthan theyield-point elongation. Theusual solution tothisprob-
lem istogivethesheet steel asmall coldreduction, usually ^^to2per
centreduction inthickness. Such atemper-rolling orskin-rolling treat-
ment cold-works themetal sufficiently toeliminate theyield point.
However, ifthe steel strain-ages during storage, theyield point will
return and difficulties with stretcher strains willreappear.
The directionality inmechanical properties produced byrolling and
other primary working processes canhave animportant effect onthe
fabricability ofthemetal. Mechanical fibering has little effect onform-
ability, whereas crystallographic fibering orpreferred orientation may
have alarge effect. Ordinarily, bending ismore difficult when thebend
line isparallel totherolling direction thanwhen thebend ismade per-
pendicular totherolling direction. Inthedeepdrawing ofcups, direc-
tionality shows upinthephenomenon ofearing. Earing istheformation

ofawavy edgeonthetopofthecup. Usually two, four, orsixears
willbeformed, depending onthepreferred orientation ofthesheet.'
Allowance fortrimming theearsfrom thecupmust bemade indeter-
mining thesizeoftheblank. Theheight oftheearsvaries directly with
thedegree ofpreferred orientation inthesheet. This, inturn, isstrongly
dependent onthedeformation characteristics ofthemetal andthecold-
work-anneal cycle towhich ithasbeen subjected.
The directionality just discussed occurs intheplane ofthesheet.
However, evenwhen there isnodirectionality intheplane ofthesheet,
sothat earing does notoccur, there islikely tobeadifference between
theproperties measured inthedirection normal tothesheet and inthe
plane ofthesheet. Measurements ofproperties inthethickness direc-
tionaredifficult tomake, although itispossible tomeasure thestrain in
thewidth andthickness directions. There areindications (seeSec.22-10)
thattheratio ofthewidth andthickness strains, called thestrain ratio,
hasaconstant value atanystrain level.Amaterial with astrain ratio
equal tounity iscompletely isotropic, while amaterial with astrain ratio
greater than unity ismore resistant tothinning during plastic forming.
22-10. Tests forFormability
Because ofthevariety ofshapes and stress distributions which are
possible intheforming ofmetals, itisnotsurprising that formability
cannot bepredicted onthebasis ofsimple mechanical properties, such as
elongation ortensile strength, orthatthere arenosimple evaluation tests
which areapplicable toallforming operations. Itcanbestated invery
general terms that ahighuniform elongation, soastoforestall local
plastic instability, andalowyield stress andhigh tensile strength, soas
tomake floweasybutfracture difficult, arethecombination ofmechani-
calproperties most conducive togood formability. The greater the
spread between theyield strength andthetensile strength, thegreater
thestrain-hardening capacity ofthematerial. Itisgenerally considered
thatahighcapacity forstrain hardening isconducive togood fabricability
since themetal incritically stressed regions canstrain-harden andpass
along thedeformation totheadjoining metal. Any retardation inthe
localization ofdeformation reduces failures bypermitting alarger area
ofmetal tocontribute tothedeformation process. Thecapability for
strain hardening isdescribed most precisely bythestrain-hardening
coefficient ndetermined from atrue stress-strain curve.
The plastic-strain ratio, described intheprevious section, hasbeen
found tobeasensitive parameter forrating thepress performance of
sheet materials. Incupping tests, which areapuredeep-drawing oper-

ation.adirect correlation hasbeenfound between ahighvalue ofstrain
ratio and drawability.' Excellent correlation hasalsobeen obtained
between theformability ofautomobile fenders andtheproduct ofthe
strain ratio and thestrain-hardening coefficient. ^The reason fora
different correlation parameter forthis latter case isprobably thatcon-
siderable stretching aswell asdrawing isrequired intheforming ofa
fender. Thegreater theamount ofstretching required inaforming oper-
ation, themore important thestrain-hardening capacity ofthematerial.
Formore reliable prediction offormability, short ofactual production
forming, itisnecessary toperform laboratory tests^ which duplicate as
closely aspossible thestrains found intheforming operation. One of
thesimplest tests isthedetermination oftheminimum bend radius. The
value ofminimum bend radius depends somewhat onthedimensions of
thebend specimen andthemethod ofbending. Unfortunately, these
testing details have never been sufficiently standardized topermit really
useful comparison ofbend-test data.
TheOlsen andErichsen cupping testshave been used formany years
forevaluating thedeep-drawing characteristics ofsheet materials. In
these tests thesheet isclamped between tworing dieswhile apunch,
usually aball, isforced against thesheet until fracture occurs. The
height ofthedome that isproduced before fracture ofthesheet istaken
asthemeasure ofdrawability. Although thetests willgenerally differ-
entiate between poorandgood material, there areoften major differences
inthepress performance ofmaterials which arenotdetected. However,
thetests are stillwidely used because oftheir simplicity andspeed of
operation.
Astandardized drawability test,known astheSwift cup-forming test,
hasbeendeveloped inEngland.'' Cylindrical cups32or50mm indiam-
eteraredeep-drawn under standard conditions withstandardized tooling.
Thedrawability isexpressed interms ofthelimiting draw ratio, which is
theratio ofthelargest blank diameter thatcanbedrawn without failure
tothepunch diameter.
Ahydraulic bulge test, inwhich asheet-metal blank isclamped overa
circular oroval dieandbulged intoadomebytheapplication ofhydraulic
pressure, hasbeen used forevaluating drawability. This test isagood
method ofproducing biaxial states ofstress. The strain distribution
produced intheblank during this test ismore likethatencountered in
thestretch forming ofashallow, recessed partthan thestrain distribution
