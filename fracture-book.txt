Preface 
The ﬁeld of fracture mechanics was virtually nonexistent prior to World War II, but has since
matured into an established discipline. Most universities with an engineering program offer at least
one fracture mechanics course on the graduate level, and an increasing number of undergraduateshave been exposed to this subject. Applications of fracture mechanics in industry are relativelycommon, as knowledge that was once conﬁned to a few specialists is becoming more widespread.
While there are a number of books on fracture mechanics, most are geared to a speci ﬁc audience.
Some treatments of this subject emphasize material testing, while others concentrate on detailedmathematical derivations. A few books address the microscopic aspects of fracture, but most consideronly continuum models. Many books are restricted to a particular material system, such as metals orpolymers. Current offerings include advanced, highly specialized books, as well as introductory texts.While the former are valuable to researchers in this ﬁeld, they are unsuitable for students with no
prior background. On the other hand, introductory treatments of the subject are sometimes simplisticand misleading.
This book provides a comprehensive treatment of fracture mechanics that should appeal to a
relatively wide audience. Theoretical background and practical applications are both covered in detail.This book is suitable as a graduate text, as well as a reference for engineers and researchers. Selectedportions of this book would also be appropriate for an undergraduate course in fracture mechanics.
This is the third edition of this text. The ﬁ rst two editions were published in 1991 and 1995.
Although the overwhelming response to the earlier editions was positive, I have received a fewconstructive criticisms from several colleagues whose opinions I respect. I have tried to incorporatetheir comments in this revision, and I hope the ﬁnal product meets with the approval of readers who
are acquainted with the ﬁ rst or second edition, as well as those who are seeing this text for the ﬁrst time.
Many sections have been revised and expanded in this latest edition. In a few cases, material from
the second edition was dropped because it had become obsolete or did not ﬁt within the context of
the revised material. Chapter 2, which covers linear elastic fracture, includes a new section on crackinteraction. In addition, a new section on so-called plane strain fracture has been added to Chapter 2in an attempt to debunk certain myths that have arisen over the years. Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 havebeen updated to account for recent developments in fracture toughness testing standards. Chapter 9on application to structures has been completely reorganized and updated. In Chapter 10, the coverageof fatigue crack closure, the fatigue threshold, and variable amplitude effects has been expanded andupdated. Perhaps the most noticeable change in the third edition is a completely new chapter onenvironmental cracking (Chapter 11). The chapter on computational fracture mechanics, which wasformerly Chapter 11, is now Chapter 12. A number of problems have been added to Chapter 13, andseveral problems from the second edition have been modi ﬁed or deleted.
The basic organization and underlying philosophy are unchanged in the third edition. The book
is intended to be readable without being superﬁcial. The fundamental concepts are ﬁrst describedqualitatively, with a minimum of higher level mathematics. This enables a student with a reasonablegrasp of undergraduate calculus to gain physical insight into the subject. For the more advancedreader, appendices at the end of certain chapters give the detailed mathematical background.
In outlining the basic principles and applications of fracture mechanics, I have attempted to
integrate materials science and solid mechanics to a much greater extent compared to those in otherfracture mechanics texts. Although continuum theory has proved to be a very powerful tool in fracturemechanics, one cannot ignore microstructural aspects. Continuum theory can predict the stressesand strains near a crack tip, but it is the material’ s microstructure that determines the critical
conditions for fracture.

The ﬁrst chapter introduces the subject of fracture mechanics and provides an overview; this
chapter includes a review of dimensional analysis, which proves to be a useful tool in later chapters.
Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 describe the fundamental concepts of linear elastic and elastic-plasticfracture mechanics, respectively. One of the most important and most often misunderstood conceptsin fracture mechanics is the single-parameter assumption, which enables the prediction of structuralbehavior from small-scale laboratory tests. When a single parameter uniquely describes the cracktip conditions, fracture toughness —a critical value of this parameter —is independent of specimen
size. When the single-parameter assumption breaks down, fracture toughness becomes size depen-dent, and a small-scale fracture toughness test may not be indicative of structural behavior. Chapter 2and Chapter 3 describe the basis of the single-parameter assumption in detail, and outline therequirements for its validity. Chapter 3 includes the results of recent research that extends fracturemechanics beyond the limits of single-parameter theory. The main bodies of Chapter 2 and Chapter 3are written in such a way as to be accessible to the beginning student. Appendix 2 and Appendix 3,which follow Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, respectively, give mathematical derivations of severalimportant relationships in linear elastic and elastic-plastic fracture mechanics. Most of the materialin these appendices requires a graduate-level background in solid mechanics.
Chapter 4 introduces dynamic and time-dependent fracture mechanics. The section on dynamic
fracture includes a brief discussion of rapid loading of a stationary crack, as well as rapid crackpropagation and arrest. The  
C* 
,  
C 
( 
t 
), and  
C 
t 
 parameters for characterizing creep crack growth are
introduced, together with analogous quantities that characterize fracture in viscoelastic materials.
Chapter 5 outlines micromechanisms of fracture in metals and alloys, while Chapter 6 describes
fracture mechanisms in polymers, ceramics, composites, and concrete. These chapters emphasizethe importance of microstructure and material properties on the fracture behavior.
The application portion of this book begins with Chapter 7, which gives practical advice on
fracture toughness testing in metals. Chapter 8 describes fracture testing of nonmetallic materials.Chapter 9 outlines the available methods for applying fracture mechanics to structures, includingboth linear elastic and elastic-plastic approaches. Chapter 10 describes the fracture mechanicsapproach to fatigue crack propagation, and discusses some of the critical issues in this area,including crack closure and the behavior of short cracks. Chapter 11 is a completely new chapteron environmental cracking. Chapter 12 outlines some of the most recent developments in compu-tational fracture mechanics. Procedures for determining stress intensity and the  
J 
 integral in
structures are described, with particular emphasis on the domain integral approach. Chapter 13contains a series of practice problems that correspond to material in Chapter 1 to Chapter 12.
If this book is used as a college text, it is unlikely that all of the material can be covered in a
single semester. Thus the instructor should select the portions of the book that suit the needs andbackground of the students. The ﬁrst three chapters, excluding appendices, should form the foundation
of any course. In addition, I strongly recommend the inclusion of at least one of the material chapters(5 or 6), regardless of whether or not materials science is the students’  major ﬁeld of study. A course
that is oriented toward applications could include Chapter 7 to Chapter 11, in addition to theearlier chapters. A graduate level course in a solid mechanics curriculum might include Appendix 2and Appendix 3, Chapter 4, Appendix 4, and Chapter 12.
I am pleased to acknowledge all those individuals who helped make all three editions of this
book possible. A number of colleagues and friends reviewed portions of the draft manuscript,provided photographs and homework problems, or both for the ﬁrst and second editions, includingW.L. Bradley, M. Cayard, R. Chona, M.G. Dawes, R.H. Dodds Jr., A.G. Evans, S.J. Garwood,J.P. Gudas, E.G. Guynn, A.L. Highsmith, R.E. Jones Jr., Y .W. Kwon, J.D. Landes, E.J. Lavernia,A. Letton, R.C. McClung, D.L. McDowell, J.G. Merkle, M.T. Miglin, D.M. Parks, P.T. Purtscher,R.A. Schapery, and C.F. Shih. Mr. Sun Yongqi produced a number of SEM fractographs especiallyfor this book. I am grateful to the following individuals for providing useful comments and literaturereferences to aid in my preparation of the third edition: R.A. Ainsworth, D.M. Boyanjian, S.C.Daniewicz, R.H. Dodds Jr., R.P. Gangloff, R. Latanision, J.C. Newman, A.K. Vasudevan, K. Wallin,

and J.G. Williams. I apologize to anyone whose name I have inadvertently omitted from this list.
When preparing the third edition, I received valuable assistance from number of colleagues at mycurrent company, Structural Reliability Technology. These individuals include Devon Brendecke,Donna Snyman, and Greg Thorwald. Last but certainly not least, Russ Hall, formerly with CRCPress and now a successful novelist, deserves special mention for convincing me to write this bookback in 1989.

History and Overview 
Fracture is a problem that society has faced for as long as there have been man-made structures.
The problem may actually be worse today than in previous centuries, because more can go wrongin our complex technological society. Major airline crashes, for instance, would not be possiblewithout modern aerospace technology. 
Fortunately, advances in the ﬁeld of fracture mechanics have helped to offset some of the
potential dangers posed by increasing technological complexity. Our understanding of how materialsfail and our ability to prevent such failures have increased considerably since World War II. Muchremains to be learned, however, and existing knowledge of fracture mechanics is not always appliedwhen appropriate.
While catastrophic failures provide income for attorneys and consulting engineers, such events
are detrimental to the economy as a whole. An economic study [1] estimated the annual cost offracture in the U.S. in 1978 at $119 billion (in 1982 dollars), about 4% of the gross national product.Furthermore, this study estimated that the annual cost could be reduced by $35 billion if currenttechnology were applied, and that further fracture mechanics research could reduce this ﬁgure byan additional $28 billion. 
1.1WHY STRUCTURES FAIL 
The cause of most structural failures generally falls into one of the following categories:
1. Negligence during design, construction, or operation of the structure.
2. Application of a new design or material, which produces an unexpected (and undesirable)
result.
In the ﬁrst instance, existing procedures are sufﬁcient to avoid failure, but are not followed by
one or more of the parties involved, due to human error, ignorance, or willful misconduct. Poorworkmanship, inappropriate or substandard materials, errors in stress analysis, and operator errorare examples of where the appropriate technology and experience are available, but not applied.
The second type of failure is much more difﬁcult to prevent. When an ‘‘improved” design is
introduced, invariably, there are factors that the designer does not anticipate. New materials canoffer tremendous advantages, but also potential problems. Consequently, a new design or materialshould be placed into service only after extensive testing and analysis. Such an approach will reducethe frequency of failures, but not eliminate them entirely; there may be important factors that areoverlooked during testing and analysis.
One of the most famous Type 2 failures is the brittle fracture of World War II Liberty ships
(see Section 1.2.2). These ships, which were the ﬁrst to have all-welded hulls, could be fabricatedmuch faster and cheaper than earlier riveted designs, but a signiﬁcant number of these vesselssustained serious fractures as a result of the design change. Today, virtually all steel ships arewelded, but sufﬁcient knowledge was gained from the Liberty ship failures to avoid similar problemsin present structures.
Knowledge must be applied in order to be useful, however. Figure 1.1 shows an example of a
Type 1 failure, where poor workmanship in a seemingly inconsequential structural detail caused amore recent fracture in a welded ship. In 1979, the Kurdistan oil tanker broke completely in two1

while sailing in the North Atlantic [2]. The combination of warm oil in the tanker with cold water
in contact with the outer hull produced substantial thermal stresses. The fracture initiated from abilge keel that was improperly welded. The weld failed to penetrate the structural detail, resultingin a severe stress concentration. Although the hull steel had adequate toughness to prevent fractureinitiation, it failed to stop the propagating crack.
Polymers, which are becoming more common in structural applications, provide a number of
advantages over metals, but also have the potential for causing Type 2 failures. For example,

polyethylene (PE) is currently the material of choice in natural gas transportation systems in the
U.S. One advantage of PE piping is that maintenance can be performed on a small branch of theline without shutting down the entire system; a local area is shut down by applying a clampingtool to the PE pipe and stopping the ﬂow of gas. The practice of pinch clamping has undoubtedlysaved vast sums of money, but has also led to an unexpected problem.
In 1983, a section of a 4-in. diameter PE pipe developed a major leak. The gas collected beneath
a residence where it ignited, resulting in severe damage to the house. Maintenance records and avisual inspection of the pipe indicated that it had been pinch clamped 6 years earlier in the regionwhere the leak developed. A failure investigation [3] concluded that the pinch clamping operationwas responsible for the failure. Microscopic examination of the pipe revealed that a small ﬂawapparently initiated on the inner surface of the pipe and grew through the wall. Figure 1.2 showsa low-magniﬁcation photograph of the fracture surface. Laboratory tests simulated the pinchclamping operation on sections of PE pipes; small thumbnail-shaped ﬂaws (Figure 1.3) formed onthe inner wall of the pipes, as a result of the severe strains that were applied. Fracture mechanicstests and analyses [3, 4] indicated that stresses in the pressurized pipe were sufﬁcient to cause theobserved time-dependent crack growth, i.e., growth from a small thumbnail ﬂaw to a through-thickness crack over a period of 6 years.
The introduction of ﬂaws in PE pipe by pinch clamping represents a Type 2 failure. The pinch
clamping process was presumably tested thoroughly before it was applied in service, but no oneanticipated that the procedure would introduce damage in the material that could lead to failureafter several years in service. Although speciﬁc data are not available, pinch clamping has undoubt-edly led to a signiﬁcant number of gas leaks. The practice of pinch clamping is still widespread inthe natural gas industry, but many companies and some states now require that a sleeve be ﬁttedto the affected region in order to relieve the stresses locally. In addition, newer grades of PE pipematerial have lower density and are less susceptible to damage by pinch clamping.
Some catastrophic events include elements both of Type 1 and Type 2 failures. On January 28,
1986, the Challenger Space Shuttle exploded because an O-ring seal in one of the main boostersdid not respond well to cold weather. The shuttle represents relatively new technology, where

service experience is limited (Type 2), but engineers from the booster manufacturer suspected a
potential problem with the O-ring seals and recommended that the launch be delayed (Type 1).Unfortunately, these engineers had little or no data to support their position and were unable toconvince their managers or NASA ofﬁcials. The tragic results of the decision to launch are well known.
On February 1, 2003, almost exactly 17 years after the Challenger accident, the Space Shuttle
Columbia was destroyed during reentry. The apparent cause of the incident was foam insulation fromthe external tank striking the left wing during launch. This debris damaged insulation tiles on theunderside of the wing, making the orbiter vulnerable to reentry temperatures that can reach 3000 
° 
F.
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) was highly critical of NASA management forcultural traits and organizational practices that, according to the board, were detrimental to safety.
Over the past few decades, the ﬁeld of fracture mechanics has undoubtedly prevented a
substantial number of structural failures. We will never know how many lives have been saved orhow much property damage has been avoided by applying this technology, because it is impossibleto quantify disasters that  
don’t 
 happen. When applied correctly, fracture mechanics not only helps
to prevent Type 1 failures but also reduces the frequency of Type 2 failures, because designers canrely on rational analysis rather than trial and error.  
1.2 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 
Designing structures to avoid fracture is not a new idea. The fact that many structures commissionedby the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt and the Caesars of Rome are still standing is a testimony to theability of early architects and engineers. In Europe, numerous buildings and bridges constructedduring the Renaissance Period are still used for their intended purpose.
The ancient structures that are still standing today obviously represent successful designs. There
were undoubtedly many more unsuccessful designs with much shorter life spans. Because knowl-edge of mechanics was limited prior to the time of Isaac Newton, workable designs were probablyachieved largely by trial and error. The Romans supposedly tested each new bridge by requiringthe design engineer to stand underneath while chariots drove over it. Such a practice would not

only provide an incentive for developing good designs, but would also result in the social equivalent
of Darwinian natural selection, where the worst engineers were removed from the profession.
The durability of ancient structures is particularly amazing when one considers that the choice
of building materials prior to the Industrial Revolution was rather limited. Metals could not beproduced in sufﬁcient quantity to be formed into load-bearing members for buildings and bridges.The primary construction materials prior to the 19th century were timber, brick, and mortar; onlythe latter two materials were usually practical for large structures such as cathedrals, because treesof sufﬁcient size for support beams were rare.
Brick and mortar are relatively brittle and are unreliable for carrying tensile loads. Consequently,
pre-Industrial Revolution structures were usually designed to be loaded in compression. Figure 1.4schematically illustrates a Roman bridge design. The arch shape causes compressive rather thantensile stresses to be transmitted through the structure.
The arch is the predominant shape in pre-Industrial Revolution architecture. Windows and roof
spans were arched in order to maintain compressive loading. For example, Figure 1.5 shows twowindows and a portion of the ceiling in King’s College Chapel in Cambridge, England. Althoughthese shapes are aesthetically pleasing, their primary purpose is more pragmatic.
Compressively loaded structures are obviously stable, since some have lasted for many centu-
ries; the pyramids in Egypt are the epitome of a stable design.
With the Industrial Revolution came mass production of iron and steel. (Or, conversely, one
might argue that mass production of iron and steel fueled the Industrial Revolution.) The availabilityof relatively ductile construction materials removed the earlier restrictions on design. It was ﬁnallyfeasible to build structures that carried tensile stresses. Note the difference between the design ofthe Tower Bridge in London (Figure 1.6) and the earlier bridge design (Figure 1.4).
The change from brick and mortar structures loaded in compression to steel structures in
tension brought problems, however. Occasionally, a steel structure would fail unexpectedly atstresses well below the anticipated tensile strength. One of the most famous of these failureswas the rupture of a molasses tank in Boston in January 1919 [5]. Over 2 million gallons ofmolasses were spilled, resulting in 12 deaths, 40 injuries, massive property damage, and severaldrowned horses.

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
The cause of the failure of the molasses tank was largely a mystery at the time. In the ﬁrst
edition of his elasticity text published in 1892, Love [6] remarked that “the conditions of rupture
are but vaguely understood.” Designers typically applied safety factors of 10 or more (based onthe tensile strength) in an effort to avoid these seemingly random failures.

Experiments performed by Leonardo da Vinci several centuries earlier provided some clues as tothe root cause of fracture. He measured the strength of iron wires and found that the strength variedinversely with wire length. These results implied that ﬂaws in the material controlled the strength;

a longer wire corresponded to a larger sample volume, and a higher probability of sampling a
region containing a ﬂaw. These results were only qualitative, however.
A quantitative connection between fracture stress and ﬂaw size came from the work of Grifﬁth,
which was published in 1920 [7]. He applied a stress analysis of an elliptical hole (performed byInglis [8] seven years earlier) to the unstable propagation of a crack. Grifﬁth invoked the ﬁrst law ofthermodynamics to formulate a fracture theory based on a simple energy balance. According to thistheory, a ﬂaw becomes unstable, and thus fracture occurs, when the strain-energy change that results
from an increment of crack growth is sufﬁcient to overcome the surface energy of the material(see Section 2.3). Grifﬁth’s model correctly predicted the relationship between strength and ﬂawsize in glass specimens. Subsequent efforts to apply the Grifﬁth model to metals were unsuccessful.Since this model assumes that the work of fracture comes exclusively from the surface energy ofthe material, the Grifﬁth approach applies only to ideally brittle solids. A modiﬁcation to Grifﬁth’smodel, that made it applicable to metals, did not come until 1948.

The mechanics of fracture progressed from being a scientiﬁc curiosity to an engineering discipline,primarily because of what happened to the Liberty ships during World War II [9].
In the early days of World War II, the U.S. was supplying ships and planes to Great Britain
under the Lend-Lease Act. Britain’s greatest need at the time was for cargo ships to carry supplies.The German navy was sinking cargo ships at three times the rate at which they could be replacedwith existing ship-building procedures.
Under the guidance of Henry Kaiser, a famous construction engineer whose previous projects
included the Hoover Dam, the U.S. developed a revolutionary procedure for fabricating shipsquickly. These new vessels, which became known as the Liberty ships, had an all-welded hull, asopposed to the riveted construction of traditional ship designs.
The Liberty ship program was a resounding success, until one day in 1943, when one of the
vessels broke completely in two while sailing between Siberia and Alaska. Subsequent fracturesoccurred in other Liberty ships. Of the roughly 2700 Liberty ships built during World War II,approximately 400 sustained fractures, of which 90 were considered serious. In 20 ships the failurewas essentially total, and about half of these broke completely in two.
Investigations revealed that the Liberty ship failures were caused by a combination of three factors:
• The welds, which were produced by a semi-skilled work force, contained crack-like ﬂaws.
• Most of the fractures initiated on the deck at square hatch corners, where there was a
local stress concentration.
• The steel from which the Liberty ships were made had poor toughness, as measured by
Charpy impact tests.
The steel in question had always been adequate for riveted ships because fracture could not
propagate across panels that were joined by rivets. A welded structure, however, is essentially asingle piece of metal; propagating cracks in the Liberty ships encountered no signiﬁcant barriers,and were sometimes able to traverse the entire hull.
Once the causes of failure were identiﬁed, the remaining Liberty ships were retroﬁtted with
rounded reinforcements at the hatch corners. In addition, high toughness steel crack-arrester plateswere riveted to the deck at strategic locations. These corrections prevented further serious fractures.
In the longer term, structural steels were developed with vastly improved toughness, and weld
quality control standards were developed. Also, a group of researchers at the Naval ResearchLaboratory in Washington, DC. studied the fracture problem in detail. The ﬁeld we now know asfracture mechanics was born in this lab during the decade following the war.

The fracture mechanics research group at the Naval Research Laboratory was led by Dr. G.R. Irwin.
After studying the early work of Inglis, Grifﬁth, and others, Irwin concluded that the basic toolsneeded to analyze fracture were already available. Irwin’s ﬁrst major contribution was to extendthe Grifﬁth approach to metals by including the energy dissipated by local plastic ﬂow [10]. Orowanindependently proposed a similar modiﬁcation to the Grifﬁth theory [11]. During this same period,Mott [12] extended the Grifﬁth theory to a rapidly propagating crack.
In 1956, Irwin [13] developed the energy release rate concept, which was derived from the
Grifﬁth theory but in a form that was more useful for solving engineering problems. Shortlyafterward, several of Irwin’s colleagues brought to his attention a paper by Westergaard [14] thatwas published in 1938. Westergaard had developed a semi-inverse technique for analyzing stressesand displacements ahead of a sharp crack. Irwin [15] used the Westergaard approach to show thatthe stresses and displacements near the crack-tip could be described by a single constant that wasrelated to the energy release rate. This crack-tip characterizing parameter later became known asthe ‘‘stress-intensity factor.” During this same period of time, Williams [16] applied a somewhatdifferent technique to derive crack tip solutions that were essentially identical to Irwin’s results.
A number of successful early applications of fracture mechanics bolstered the standing of this
new ﬁeld in the engineering community. In 1956, Wells [17] used fracture mechanics to show thatthe fuselage failures in several Comet jet aircraft resulted from fatigue cracks reaching a criticalsize. These cracks initiated at windows and were caused by insufﬁcient reinforcement locally,combined with square corners that produced a severe stress concentration. (Recall the unfortunatehatch design in the Liberty ships.) A second early application of fracture mechanics occurred atGeneral Electric in 1957. Winne and Wundt [18] applied Irwin’s energy release rate approach tothe failure of large rotors from steam turbines. They were able to predict the bursting behavior oflarge disks extracted from rotor forgings, and applied this knowledge to the prevention of fracturein actual rotors.
It seems that all great ideas encounter stiff opposition initially, and fracture mechanics is no
exception. Although the U.S. military and the electric power generating industry were very sup-portive of the early work in this ﬁeld, such was not the case in all provinces of government andindustry. Several government agencies openly discouraged research in this area.
In 1960, Paris and his coworkers [19] failed to ﬁnd a receptive audience for their ideas on
applying fracture mechanics principles to fatigue crack growth. Although Paris et al. providedconvincing experimental and theoretical arguments for their approach, it seems that design engineerswere not yet ready to abandon their S-N curves in favor of a more rigorous approach to fatiguedesign. The resistance to this work was so intense that Paris and his colleagues were unable to ﬁnda peer-reviewed technical journal that was willing to publish their manuscript. They ﬁnally optedto publish their work in a University of Washington periodical entitled

The Second World War obviously separates two distinct eras in the history of fracture mechanics.There is, however, some ambiguity as to how the period between the end of the war and the presentshould be divided. One possible historical boundary occursed around 1960, when the fundamentalsof linear elastic fracture mechanics were fairly well established, and researchers turned theirattention to crack-tip plasticity.

Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) ceases to be valid when signiﬁcant plastic deforma-
tion precedes failure. During a relatively short time period (1960–1961) several researchers devel-
oped analyses to correct for yielding at the crack tip, including Irwin [20], Dugdale [21], Barenblatt[22], and Wells [23]. The Irwin plastic zone correction [20] was a relatively simple extension ofLEFM, while Dugdale [21] and Barenblatt [22] each developed somewhat more elaborate modelsbased on a narrow strip of yielded material at the crack tip. 
Wells [23] proposed the displacement of the crack faces as an alternative fracture criterion
when signiﬁcant plasticity precedes failure. Previously, Wells had worked with Irwin while on asabbatical at the Naval Research Laboratory. When Wells returned to his post at the British WeldingResearch Association, he attempted to apply LEFM to low- and medium-strength structural steels.These materials were too ductile for LEFM to apply, but Wells noticed that the crack faces movedapart with plastic deformation. This observation led to the development of the parameter now knownas the crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD).
In 1968, Rice [24] developed another parameter to characterize nonlinear material behavior
ahead of a crack. By idealizing plastic deformation as nonlinear elastic, Rice was able to generalizethe energy release rate to nonlinear materials. He showed that this nonlinear energy release ratecan be expressed as a line integral, which he called the  
J 
 integral, evaluated along an arbitrary
contour around the crack. At the time his work was being published, Rice discovered thatEshelby [25] had previously published several so-called conservation integrals, one of which wasequivalent to Rice’s  
J 
 integral. Eshelby, however, did not apply his integrals to crack problems.
That same year, Hutchinson [26] and Rice and Rosengren [27] related the 
 J 
 integral to crack-
tip stress ﬁelds in nonlinear materials. These analyses showed that 
 J 
 can be viewed as a nonlinear,
stress-intensity parameter as well as an energy release rate.
Rice’s work might have been relegated to obscurity had it not been for the active research effort
by the nuclear power industry in the U.S. in the early 1970s. Because of legitimate concerns forsafety, as well as political and public relations considerations, the nuclear power industry endeavoredto apply state-of-the-art technology, including fracture mechanics, to the design and constructionof nuclear power plants. The difﬁculty with applying fracture mechanics in this instance was thatmost nuclear pressure vessel steels were too tough to be characterized with LEFM without resortingto enormous laboratory specimens. In 1971, Begley and Landes [28], who were research engineersat Westinghouse, came across Rice’s article and decided, despite skepticism from their co-workers,to characterize the fracture toughness of these steels with the 
 J 
 integral. Their experiments were
very successful and led to the publication of a standard procedure for 
 J 
 testing of metals 10 years
later [29].
Material toughness characterization is only one aspect of fracture mechanics. In order to apply
fracture mechanics concepts to design, one must have a mathematical relationship between tough-ness, stress, and ﬂaw size. Although these relationships were well established for linear elasticproblems, a fracture design analysis based on the 
 J 
 integral was not available until Shih and
Hutchinson [30] provided the theoretical framework for such an approach in 1976. A few yearslater, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) published a fracture design handbook [31] basedon the Shih and Hutchinson methodology.
In the United Kingdom, Well’s CTOD parameter was applied extensively to fracture analysis
of welded structures, beginning in the late 1960s. While fracture research in the U.S. was drivenprimarily by the nuclear power industry during the 1970s, fracture research in the U.K. wasmotivated largely by the development of oil resources in the North Sea. In 1971, Burdekin andDawes [32] applied several ideas proposed by Wells [33] several years earlier and developed theCTOD design curve, a semiempirical fracture mechanics methodology for welded steel structures.The nuclear power industry in the UK developed their own fracture design analysis [34], based onthe strip yield model of Dugdale [21] and Barenblatt [22].
Shih [35] demonstrated a relationship between the 
 J 
 integral and CTOD, implying that both
parameters are equally valid for characterizing fracture. The

design approaches developed in the U.S. and the British CTOD methodology have begun to merge
in recent years, with positive aspects of each approach combined to yield improved analyses. Bothparameters are currently applied throughout the world to a range of materials.
Much of the theoretical foundation of dynamic fracture mechanics was developed in the period
between 1960 and 1980. Signiﬁcant contributions were made by a number of researchers, asdiscussed in Chapter 4.

RESENT 
The ﬁeld of fracture mechanics matured in the last two decades of the 20th century. Current researchtends to result in incremental advances rather than major gains. The application of this technologyto practical problems is so pervasive that fracture mechanics is now considered an establishedengineering discipline.
More sophisticated models for material behavior are being incorporated into fracture mechanics
analyses. While plasticity was the important concern in 1960, more recent work has gone a stepfurther, incorporating time-dependent nonlinear material behavior such as viscoplasticity and vis-coelasticity. The former is motivated by the need for tough, creep-resistant high temperature materials,while the latter reﬂects the increasing proportion of plastics in structural applications. Fracturemechanics has also been used (and sometimes abused) in the characterization of composite materials.
Another trend in recent research is the development of microstuctural models for fracture and
models to relate local and global fracture behavior of materials. A related topic is the efforts tocharacterize and predict geometry dependence of fracture toughness. Such approaches are necessarywhen traditional, so-called single-parameter fracture mechanics break down.
The continuing explosion in computer technology has aided both the development and application
of fracture mechanics technology. For example, an ordinary desktop computer is capable of performingcomplex three-dimensional ﬁnite element analyses of structural components that contain cracks.
Computer technology has also spawned entirely new areas of fracture mechanics research.
Problems encountered in the microelectronics industry have led to active research in interfacefracture and nanoscale fracture. 
1.3THE FRACTURE MECHANICS APPROACH TO DESIGN 
Figure 1.7 contrasts the fracture mechanics approach with the traditional approach to structuraldesign and material selection. In the latter case, the anticipated design stress is compared to theﬂow properties of candidate materials; a material is assumed to be adequate if its strength is greaterthan the expected applied stress. Such an approach may attempt to guard against brittle fractureby imposing a safety factor on stress, combined with minimum tensile elongation requirements onthe material. The fracture mechanics approach (Figure 1.7(b)) has three important variables, ratherthan two as in Figure 1.7(a). The additional structural variable is ﬂaw size, and fracture toughnessreplaces strength as the relevant material property. Fracture mechanics quantiﬁes the critical com-binations of these three variables.
There are two alternative approaches to fracture analysis: the energy criterion and the stress-
intensity approach. These two approaches are equivalent in certain circumstances. Both are dis-cussed brieﬂy below.

The energy approach states that crack extension (i.e., fracture) occurs when the energy availablefor crack growth is sufﬁcient to overcome the resistance of the material. The material resistancemay include the surface energy, plastic work, or other types of energy dissipation associated witha propagating crack.

Grifﬁth [7] was the ﬁrst to propose the energy criterion for fracture, but Irwin [13] is primarily
responsible for developing the present version of this approach: the energy release rate  
G 
 which is
deﬁned as the rate of change in potential energy with the crack area for a linear elastic material.

toughness.
For a crack of length

 in an inﬁnite plate subject to a remote tensile stress (Figure 1.8), the
energy release rate is given by

 is Young’s modulus,

 is the remotely applied stress, and

G 
 is
the driving force for fracture, while

 is the material’s resistance to fracture. To draw an analogy
to the strength of materials approach of Figure 1.7(a), the applied stress can be viewed as thedriving force for plastic deformation, while the yield strength is a measure of the material’sresistance to deformation.
The tensile stress analogy is also useful for illustrating the concept of similitude. A yield strength
value measured with a laboratory specimen should be applicable to a large structure; yield strengthdoes not depend on specimen size, provided the material is reasonably homogeneous. One of thefundamental assumptions of fracture mechanics is that fracture toughness (

 in this case) is

independent of the size and geometry of the cracked body; a fracture toughness measurement on
a laboratory specimen should be applicable to a structure. As long as this assumption is valid, allconﬁguration effects are taken into account by the driving force

valid as long as the material behavior is predominantly linear elastic.

Figure 1.9 schematically shows an element near the tip of a crack in an elastic material, togetherwith the in-plane stresses on this element. Note that each stress component is proportional to asingle constant  
K 
I 
. If this constant is known, the entire stress distribution at the crack tip can be
computed with the equations in Figure 1.9. This constant, which is called the stress-intensity factor,completely characterizes the crack-tip conditions in a linear elastic material. (The meaning of thesubscript on K is explained in Chapter 2.) If one assumes that the material fails locally at some
critical combination of stress and strain, then it follows that fracture must occur at a critical stressintensity K
Ic. Thus, KIc is an alternate measure of fracture toughness.
For the plate illustrated in Figure 1.8, the stress-intensity factor is given by 
(1.3)FIGURE 1.8 Through-thickness crack in an inﬁnite plate subject to a remote tensile stress. In practical terms,
‘‘inﬁnite” means that the width of the plate is >> 2 a.

Failure occurs when KI = KIc. In this case, KI is the driving force for fracture and KIc is a measure
of material resistance. As with Gc, the property of similitude should apply to KIc. That is, KIc is
assumed to be a size-independent material property.
Comparing Equation (1.1) and Equation (1.3) results in a relationship between KI and G:
(1.4) 
This same relationship obviously holds for Gc and KIc. Thus, the energy and stress-intensity
approaches to fracture mechanics are essentially equivalent for linear elastic materials.
1.3.3 T IME-DEPENDENT  CRACK GROWTH  AND DAMAGE  TOLERANCE
Fracture mechanics often plays a role in life prediction of components that are subject to time-
dependent crack growth mechanisms such as fatigue or stress corrosion cracking. The rate of cracking
can be correlated with fracture mechanics parameters such as the stress-intensity factor, and the criticalcrack size for failure can be computed if the fracture toughness is known. For example, the fatiguecrack growth rate in metals can usually be described by the following empirical relationship:
(1.5) 
where da/dN is the crack growth per cycle, ∆K is the stress-intensity range, and C and m are
material constants.
Damage tolerance, as its name suggests, entails allowing subcritical ﬂaws to remain in a
structure. Repairing ﬂawed material or scrapping a ﬂawed structure is expensive and is oftenunnecessary. Fracture mechanics provides a rational basis for establishing ﬂaw tolerance limits.
Consider a ﬂaw in a structure that grows with time (e.g., a fatigue crack or a stress corrosion
crack) as illustrated schematically in Figure 1.10. The initial  crack size is inferred from
nondestructive examination (NDE), and the critical  crack size is computed from the applied
stress and fracture toughness. Normally, an allowable  ﬂaw size would be deﬁned by dividing
the critical size by a safety factor. The predicted service life of the structure can then be inferredby calculating the time required for the ﬂaw to grow from its initial size to the maximumallowable size.FIGURE 1.9 Stresses near the tip of a crack in an elastic material.

1.4 EFFECT OF MATERIAL PROPER TIES ON FRA CTURE
Figure 1.11 shows a simpliﬁed family tree for the ﬁeld of fracture mechanics. Most of the early
work was applicable only to linear elastic materials under quasistatic conditions, while subsequentadvances in fracture research incorporated other types of material behavior. Elastic-plastic fracturemechanics considers plastic deformation under quasistatic conditions, while dynamic, viscoelastic,and viscoplastic fracture mechanics include time as a variable. A dashed line is drawn betweenlinear elastic and dynamic fracture mechanics because some early research considered dynamiclinear elastic behavior. The chapters that describe the various types of fracture behavior are shownin Figure 1.11. Elastic-plastic, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic fracture behavior are sometimesincluded in the more general heading of nonlinear  fracture mechanics . The branch of fracture
mechanics one should apply to a particular problem obviously depends on material behavior. 
Consider a cracked plate (Figure 1.8) that is loaded to failure. Figure 1.12 is a schematic plot
of failure stress vs. fracture toughness K
Ic. For low toughness materials, brittle fracture is the governingFIGURE 1.10 The damage tolerance approach to design.

failure mechanism, and critical stress varies linearly with KIc, as predicted by Equation (1.3). At very
high toughness values, LEFM is no longer valid, and failure is governed by the ﬂow properties of
the material. At intermediate toughness levels, there is a transition between brittle fracture underlinear elastic conditions and ductile overload. Nonlinear fracture mechanics bridges the gap betweenLEFM and collapse. If toughness is low, LEFM is applicable to the problem, but if toughness issufﬁciently high, fracture mechanics ceases to be relevant to the problem because failure stress isinsensitive to toughness; a simple limit load analysis is all that is required to predict failure stressin a material with very high fracture toughness.

1.5 A BRIEF REVIEW OF DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS
At ﬁrst glance, a section on dimensional analysis may seem out of place in the introductory chapter
of a book on fracture mechanics. However, dimensional analysis is an important tool for developingmathematical models of physical phenomena, and it can help us understand existing models. Manydifﬁcult concepts in fracture mechanics become relatively transparent when one considers therelevant dimensions of the problem. For example, dimensional analysis gives us a clue as to whena particular model, such as linear elastic fracture mechanics, is no longer v alid. 
Let us review the fundamental theorem of dimensional analysis and then look at a few simple
applications to fracture mechanics.
1.5.1 T HE BUCKINGHAM  Π-THEOREM
The ﬁrst step in building a mathematical model of a physical phenomenon is to identify all of theparameters that may inﬂuence the phenomenon. Assume that a problem, or at least an idealizedversion of it, can be described by the following set of scalar quantities: { u, W
1, W2,…, Wn}. The
dimensions of all quantities in this set is denoted by {[ u], [W1], [W2],…, [Wn]}. Now suppose that
we wish to express the ﬁrst variable u as a function of the remaining parameters:
(1.6) 
Thus, the process of modeling the problem is reduced to ﬁnding a mathematical relationship thatrepresents f as best as possible. We might accomplish this by performing a set of experiments in
which we measure u while varying each W
i independently. The number of experiments can be
greatly reduced, and the modeling processes simpliﬁed, through dimensional analysis. The ﬁrststep is to identify all of the fundamental dimensional units  (fdu’s) in the problem: { L
1, L2,…, Lm}.
For example, a typical mechanics problem may have { L1 = length, L2 = mass, L3 = time}. We can
express the dimensions of each quantity in our problem as the product of the powers of the fdu’s;i.e., for any quantity X, we have
(1.7) 
The quantity X is dimensionless if [ X] = 1.
In the set of Ws, we can identify m primary quantities  that contain all of the fdu’s in the problem.
The remaining variables are secondary quantities, and their dimensions can be expressed in termsof the primary quantities:
(1.8) 
Thus, we can deﬁne a set of new quantities 
πi that are dimensionless:
(1.9) 
Similarly, the dimensions of u can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the primary quantities:

and we can form the following dimensionless quantity:
(1.11) 
According to the Buckingham Π-theorem, π depends only on the other dimensionless groups:
(1.12) 
This new function F is independent of the system of measurement units. Note that the number of
quantities in F has been reduced from the old function by m, the number of fdu’s. Thus dimensional
analysis has reduced the degrees of freedom in our model, and we need vary only n–m quantities
in our experiments or computer simulations.
The Buckingham Π-theorem gives guidance on how to scale a problem to different sizes or to
other systems of measurement units. Each dimensionless group ( πi) must be scaled in order to obtain
equivalent conditions at two different scales. Suppose, for example, that we wish to perform wind
tunnel tests on a model of a new airplane design. Dimensional analysis tells us that we should reduceall length dimensions in the same proportion; thus we would build a ‘‘scale” model of the airplane.The length dimensions of the plane are not the only important quantities in the problem, however. Inorder to model the aerodynamic behavior accurately, we would need to scale the wind velocity andthe viscosity of the air in accordance with the reduced size of the airplane model. Modifying theviscosity of the air is not practical in most cases. In real wind tunnel tests, the size of the model isusually close enough to full scale that the errors introduced by not scaling viscosity are minor.
1.5.2 D IMENSIONAL  ANALYSIS  IN FRACTURE  MECHANICS
Dimensional analysis proves to be a very useful tool in fracture mechanics. Later chapters describehow dimensional arguments play a key role in developing mathematical descriptions for importantphenomena. For now, let us explore a few simple examples. 
Consider a series of cracked plates under a remote tensile stress , as illustrated in Figure 1.13.
Assume that each is a two-dimensional problem; that is, the thickness dimension does not enterinto the problem. The ﬁrst case, Figure 1.13(a), is an edge crack of length a in an elastic, semi-inﬁnite
plate. In this case inﬁnite means that the plate width is much larger than the crack size. Supposethat we wish to know how one of the stress components 
σij varies with position. We will adopt a
polar coordinate system with the origin at the crack tip, as illustrated in Figure 1.9. A generalizedfunctional relationship can be written as
(1.13) 
where
ν = Poisson’s ratio 
σkl = other stress components
εkl = all nonzero components of the strain tensor
We can eliminate σkl and εkl from f1 by noting that for a linear elastic problem, strain is
uniquely deﬁned by stress through Hooke’s law and the stress components at a point increasein proportion to one another. Let 
σ∞ and a be the primary quantities. Invoking the Buckingham

When the plate width is ﬁnite (Figure 1.13(b)), an additional dimension is required to describe the
problem:
(1.15) 
Thus, one might expect Equation (1.14) to give erroneous results when the crack extends across asigniﬁcant fraction of the plate width. Consider a large plate and a small plate made of the samematerial (same E and 
ν), with the same a/W ratio, loaded to the same remote stress. The local
stress at an angle θ from the crack plane in each plate would depend only on the r/a ratio, as long
as both plates remained elastic.
When a plastic zone forms ahead of the crack tip (Figure 1.13(c)), the problem is complicated
further. If we assume that the material does not strain harden, the yield strength is sufﬁcient todeﬁne the ﬂow properties. The stress ﬁeld is given by
(1.16) 
The ﬁrst two functions, F
1 and F2, correspond to LEFM, while F3 is an elastic-plastic relationship.
Thus, dimensional analysis tells us that LEFM is valid only when ry << a and <<σYS. In Chapter 2,
the same conclusion is reached through a somewhat more complicated argument.

Linear Elastic Fracture 
Mechanics 
The concepts of fracture mechanics that were derived prior to 1960 are applicable only to materials
that obey Hooke’s law. Although corrections for small-scale plasticity were proposed as early as1948, these analyses are restricted to structures whose global behavior is linear elastic.
Since 1960, fracture mechanics theories have been developed to account for various types of
nonlinear material behavior (i.e., plasticity and viscoplasticity) as well as dynamic effects. All ofthese more recent results, however, are extensions of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM).Thus a solid background in the fundamentals of LEFM is essential to an understanding of moreadvanced concepts in fracture mechanics.
This chapter describes both the energy and stress intensity approaches to linear fracture mechan-
ics. The early work of Inglis and Grifﬁth is summarized, followed by an introduction to the energyrelease rate and stress intensity parameters. The appendix at the end of this chapter includesmathematical derivations of several important results in LEFM.
Subsequent chapters also address linear elastic fracture mechanics. Chapter 7 and Chapter 8
discuss laboratory testing of linear elastic materials, Chapter 9 addresses application of LEFM tostructures, Chapter 10 and chapter 11 apply LEFM to fatigue crack propagation and environmentalcracking, respectively. Chapter 12 outlines numerical methods for computing stress intensity factorand energy release rate. 
2.1AN ATOMIC VIEW OF FRACTURE 
A material fractures when sufﬁcient stress and work are applied at the atomic level to break thebonds that hold atoms together. The bond strength is supplied by the attractive forces between atoms.
Figure 2.1 shows schematic plots of the potential energy and force vs. the separation distance
between atoms. The equilibrium spacing occurs where the potential energy is at a minimum. Atensile force is required to increase the separation distance from the equilibrium value; this forcemust exceed the cohesive force to sever the bond completely. The bond energy is given by
(2.1)
where  
x 
o 
 is the equilibrium spacing and  
P 
 is the applied force. 
It is possible to estimate the cohesive strength at the atomic level by idealizing the interatomic
force-displacement relationship as one half of the period of a sine wave:
(2.2a)
where the distance  
λ 
 is deﬁned in Figure 2.1. For the sake of simplicity, the origin is deﬁned at  
x 
o 
.
For small displacements, the force-displacement relationship is linear:

The surface energy can be estimated as follows:

The surface energy per unit area,

, is equal to one-half of the fracture energy because two surfaces
are created when a material fractures. Substituting Equation (2.4) into Equation (2.6) and solving
for  
σ

gives
(2.7) 
2.2STRESS CONCENTRATION EFFECT OF FLAWS 
The derivation in the previous section showed that the theoretical cohesive strength of a materialis approximately  
E 
/ 
π 
, but experimental fracture strengths for brittle materials are typically three
or four orders of magnitude below this value. As discussed in Chapter 1, experiments by Leonardoda Vinci, Grifﬁth, and others indicated that the discrepancy between the actual strengths of brittlematerials and theoretical estimates was due to ﬂaws in these materials. Fracture cannot occur unlessthe stress at the atomic level exceeds the cohesive strength of the material. Thus, the ﬂaws mustlower the global strength by magnifying the stress locally.
The ﬁrst quantitative evidence for the stress concentration effect of ﬂaws was provided by Inglis
[1], who analyzed elliptical holes in ﬂat plates. His analyses included an elliptical hole 2 
a 
 long by
2 
b 
 wide with an applied stress perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse (see Figure 2.2). He
assumed that the hole was not inﬂuenced by the plate boundary, i.e., the plate width  
>> 
 2 
a  
and the
plate height  
>> 
 2 
b 
. The stress at the tip of the major axis (Point  
A 
) is given by
(2.8)
The ratio  is deﬁned as the stress concentration factor  
k 
t 
. When  
a 
 = 
  
b 
, the hole is circular
and  
k 
t 
  
= 
 3.0, a well-known result that can be found in most strength-of-materials textbooks.
As the major axis,  
a 
, increases relative to  
b 
, the elliptical hole begins to take on the appearance
of a sharp crack. For this case, Inglis found it more convenient to express Equation (2.8) in termsof the radius of curvature  
ρ 
:

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Inglis showed that Equation (2.11) gives a good approximation for the stress concentration due to
a notch that is not elliptical except at the tip.
Equation (2.11) predicts an inﬁnite stress at the tip of an inﬁnitely sharp crack, where  
ρ 
  
= 
 0.
This result caused concern when it was ﬁrst discovered, because no material is capable of with-standing inﬁnite stress. A material that contains a sharp crack should theoretically fail upon theapplication of an inﬁnitesimal load. The paradox of a sharp crack motivated Grifﬁth [2] to developa fracture theory based on energy rather than local stress (Section 2.3).
An inﬁnitely sharp crack in a continuum is a mathematical abstraction that is not relevant to
real materials, which are made of atoms. Metals, for instance, deform plastically, which causes aninitially sharp crack to blunt. In the absence of plastic deformation, the minimum radius a crack tipcan have is on the order of the atomic radius. By substituting  
ρ  
= 
 x 
o 
 into Equation (2.11), we obtain
an estimate of the local stress concentration at the tip of an atomically sharp crack:
(2.12)
If it is assumed that fracture occurs when  
σ 
A 
 =  
σ 
c 
, Equation (2.12) can be set equal to Equation
(2.7), resulting in the following expression for the remote stress at failure:

Equation (2.13) must be viewed as a rough estimate of failure stress, because the continuum
assumption upon which the Inglis analysis is based is not valid at the atomic level. However, Gehlenand Kanninen [3] obtained similar results from a numerical simulation of a crack in a two-dimensional lattice, where discrete “atoms” were connected by nonlinear springs:
(2.14)
where  
α 
 is a constant, on the order of unity, which depends slightly on the assumed atomic force-
displacement law (Equation (2.2)). 
2.3 THE GRIFFITH ENERGY BALANCE 
According to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, when a system goes from a nonequilibrium state toequilibrium, there is a net decrease in energy. In 1920, Grifﬁth applied this idea to the formationof a crack [2]: 
It may be supposed, for the present purpose, that the crack is formed by the sudden annihilation of
the tractions acting on its surface. At the instant following this operation, the strains, and thereforethe potential energy under consideration, have their original values; but in general, the new state isnot one of equilibrium. If it is not a state of equilibrium, then, by the theorem of minimum potentialenergy, the potential energy is reduced by the attainment of equilibrium; if it is a state of equilibrium,the energy does not change. 
A crack can form (or an existing crack can grow) only if such a process causes the total energy
to decrease or remain constant. Thus the critical conditions for fracture can be deﬁned as the point
where crack growth occurs under equilibrium conditions, with no net change in total energy. 
Consider a plate subjected to a constant stress  
σ 
 which contains a crack 2 
a 
 long (Figure 2.3).
Assume that the plate width  
>> 
 2 
a 
 and that plane stress conditions prevail. (Note that the plates
in Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3 are identical when  
a 
  
>> 
  
b 
). In order for this crack to increase in size,
sufﬁcient potential energy must be available in the plate to overcome the surface energy of thematerial. The Grifﬁth energy balance for an incremental increase in the crack area  
d 
A, under
equilibrium conditions, can be expressed in the following way:
(2.15a)
or
(2.15b)
where  
E 
 = total energy  
Π 
 = potential energy supplied by the internal strain energy and external forces 
W 
s 
 = work required to create new surfaces
For the cracked plate illustrated in Figure 2.3, Grifﬁth used the stress analysis of Inglis [1] to
show that

deﬁned as the projected area of the crack (2

two matching surfaces, the surface area is 2

The Grifﬁth approach can be applied to other crack shapes. For example, the fracture stress
for a penny-shaped ﬂaw embedded in the material (Figure 2.4) is given by
(2.20)
where a is the crack radius and ν is Poisson’s ratio.
2.3.1 C OMPARISON  WITH THE CRITICAL  STRESS CRITERION
The Grifﬁth model is based on a global energy balance: for fracture to occur, the energy stored
in the structure must be sufﬁcient to overcome the surface energy of the material. Since fractureinvolves the breaking of bonds, the stress on the atomic level must be equal to the cohesivestress. This local stress intensiﬁcation can be provided by ﬂaws in the material, as discussed inSection 2.2.
The similarity between Equation (2.13), Equation (2.14), and Equation (2.19) is obvious.
Predictions of the global fracture stress from the Grifﬁth approach and the local stress criteriondiffer by less than 40%. Thus, these two approaches are consistent with one another, at least in thecase of a sharp crack in an ideally brittle solid.
An apparent contradiction emerges when the crack-tip radius is signiﬁcantly greater than the
atomic spacing. The change in the stored energy with crack formation (Equation (2.16)) is insen-sitive to the notch radius as long as a >> b; thus, the Grifﬁth model implies that the fracture stress
is insensitive to 
ρ. According to the Inglis stress analysis, however, in order for σc to be attained
at the tip of the notch, σf must vary with .FIGURE 2.4 A penny-shaped (circular) crack embed-

32 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Consider a crack with ρ = 5 × 10−6 m. Such a crack would appear sharp under a light microscope,
but ρ would be four orders of magnitude larger than the atomic spacing in a typical crystalline
solid. Thus the local stress approach would predict a global fracture strength 100 times larger than
the Grifﬁth equation. The actual material behavior is somewhere between these extremes; fracturestress does depend on notch root radius, but not to the extent implied by the Inglis stress analysis.
The apparent discrepancy between the critical stress criterion and the energy criterion based
on thermodynamics can be resolved by viewing fracture as a nucleation and growth process. Whenthe global stress and crack size satisfy the Grifﬁth energy criterion, there is sufﬁcient thermodynamicdriving force to grow the crack, but fracture must ﬁrst be nucleated. This situation is analogous tothe solidiﬁcation of liquids. Water, for example, is in equilibrium with ice at 0 °C, but the liquid-
solid reaction requires ice crystals to be nucleated, usually on the surface of another solid (e.g.,your car windshield on a January morning). When nucleation is suppressed, liquid water can besuper cooled (at least momentarily) to as much as 30 °C below the equilibrium freezing point.
Nucleation of fracture can come from a number of sources. For example, microscopic surface
roughness at the tip of the ﬂaw could produce sufﬁcient local stress concentration to nucleatefailure. Another possibility, illustrated in Figure 2.5, involves a sharp microcrack near the tip of amacroscopic ﬂaw with a ﬁnite notch radius. The macroscopic crack magniﬁes the stress in thevicinity of the microcrack, which propagates when it satisﬁes the Grifﬁth equation. The microcracklinks with the large ﬂaw, which then propagates if the Grifﬁth criterion is satisﬁed globally. Thistype of mechanism controls cleavage fracture in ferritic steels, as discussed in Chapter 5.
2.3.2 M ODIFIED  GRIFFITH  EQUATION
Equation (2.19) is valid only for ideally brittle solids. Grifﬁth obtained a good agreement betweenEquation (2.19) and the experimental fracture strength of glass, but the Grifﬁth equation severelyunderestimates the fracture strength of metals.
Irwin [4] and Orowan [5] independently modiﬁed the Grifﬁth expression to account for materials
that are capable of plastic ﬂow. The revised expression is given by
(2.21)
where 
γp is the plastic work per unit area of surface created and is typically much larger than γs.

Linear Elastic F racture Mec hanics 33
In an ideally brittle solid, a crack can be formed merely by breaking atomic bonds; γs reﬂects
the total energy of broken bonds in a unit area. When a crack propagates through a metal,
however, a dislocation motion occurs in the vicinity of the crack tip, resulting in additionalenergy dissipation.
Although Irwin and Orowan originally derived Equation (2.21) for metals, it is possible to
generalize the Grifﬁth model to account for any type of energy dissipation:
(2.22)
where w
f is the fracture energy, which could include plastic, viscoelastic, or viscoplastic effects,
depending on the material. The fracture energy can also be inﬂuenced by crack meandering andbranching, which increase the surface area. Figure 2.6 illustrates various types of material behaviorand the corresponding fracture energy.
A word of caution is necessary when applying Equation (2.22) to materials that exhibit nonlinear
deformation. The Grifﬁth model, in particular Equation (2.16), applies only to linear elastic materialbehavior. Thus, the global behavior of the structure must be elastic. Any nonlinear effects, such asplasticity, must be conﬁned to a small region near the crack tip. In addition, Equation (2.22) assumesthat w
f is constant; in many ductile materials, the fracture energy increases with crack growth, as
discussed in Section 2.5.
EXAMPLE 2.1
A ﬂat plate made from a brittle material contains a macroscopic through-thickness crack with half
length a1 and notch tip radius ρ. A sharp penny-shaped microcrack with radius a2 is located near the
tip of the larger ﬂaw, as illustrated in Figure 2.5. Estimate the minimum size of the microcrack requiredto cause failure in the plate when the Grifﬁth equation is satisﬁed by the global stress and a
1.
Solution : The nominal stress at failure is obtained by substituting a1 into Equation (2.19). The stress
in the vicinity of the microcrack can be estimated from Equation (2.11), which is set equal to the Grifﬁthcriterion for the penny-shaped microcrack (Equation 2.20):
 
Solving for a2 gives
for ν = 0.3, a2 = 0.68 ρ. Thus the nucleating microcrack must be approximately the size of the
macroscopic crack-tip radius. 
This derivation contains a number of simplifying assumptions. The notch-tip stress computed from
Equation (2.11) is assumed to act uniformly ahead of the notch, in the region of the microcrack; theactual stress would decay away from the notch tip. Also, this derivation neglects free boundary effects
from the tip of the macroscopic notch.σπffEw

2.4 THE ENERGY RELEASE RA TE
In 1956, Irwin [6] proposed an energy approach for fracture that is essentially equivalent to the Grifﬁth
model, except that Irwin’s approach is in a form that is more convenient for solving engineeringproblems. Irwin deﬁned an energy release rate  G, which is a measure of the energy available for an
increment of crack extension: 
(2.23)(a)
                                                                                     (b)

Linear Elastic F racture Mec hanics 35
The term rate, as it is used in this context, does not refer to a derivative with respect to time; G is
the rate of change in potential energy with the crack area. Since G is obtained from the derivative
of a potential, it is also called the crack extension force or the crack driving force . According to
Equation (2.18a), the energy release rate for a wide plate in plane stress with a crack of length 2 a
(Figure 2.3) is given by
(2.24)
Referring to the previous section, crack extension occurs when G reaches a critical value, i.e.,
(2.25)
where Gc is a measure of the  fracture toughness  of the material.
The potential energy of an elastic body, Π, is deﬁned as follows:
(2.26)
where U is the strain energy stored in the body and F is the work done by external forces.
Consider a cracked plate that is dead loaded, as illustrated in Figure 2.7. Since the load is ﬁxed
at P, the structure is said to be load controlled . For this case

When displacement is ﬁxed (Figure 2.8), the plate is displacement controlled ; F = 0 and Π = U. Thus
(2.28)
It is convenient at this point to introduce the compliance, which is the inverse of the plate stiffness:
(2.29)
By substituting Equation (2.29) into Equation (2.27) and Equation (2.28) it can be shown that
(2.30)
for both load control and displacement control. Therefore, the energy release rate, as deﬁned in
Equation (2.23), is the same for load control and displacement control. Also

Equation (2.31) is demonstrated graphically in Figure 2.7(b) and Figure 2.8(b). In load control,
a crack extension da results in a net increase  in strain energy because of the contribution of the
external force P:
When displacement is ﬁxed, dF = 0 and the strain energy decreases :
where dP is negative. As can be seen in Figure 2.7(b) and Figure 2.8(b), the absolute values of
these energies differ by the amount , which is negligible. Thus

Substituting C into Equation (2.30) gives
2.5 INST ABILITY AND THE R CUR VE
Crack extension occurs when G = 2wf; but crack growth may be stable or unstable, depending on
how G and wf vary with crack size. To illustrate stable and unstable behavior, it is convenient to
replace 2wf with R, the material resistance to crack extension. A plot of R vs. crack extension is
called a resistance curve  or R curve. The corresponding plot of G vs. crack extension is the driving
force curve .
Consider a wide plate with a through crack of initial length 2 ao (Figure 2.3). At a ﬁxed remote
stress σ, the energy release rate varies linearly with crack size (Equation (2.24)). Figure 2.10 shows
schematic driving force vs. R curves for two types of material behavior.
The ﬁrst case, Figure 2.10(a), shows a ﬂat R curve, where the material resistance is constant
with crack growth. When the stress is σ1, the crack is stable. Fracture occurs when the stress reaches
σ2; the crack propagation is unstable because the driving force increases with crack growth, but
the material resistance remains constant.
Figure 2.10(b) illustrates a material with a rising R curve. The crack grows a small amount
when the stress reaches σ2, but cannot grow further unless the stress increases. When the stress is
ﬁxed at σ2, the driving force increases at a slower rate than R. Stable crack growth continues as
the stress increases to σ3. Finally, when the stress reaches σ4, the driving force curve is tangent to
the R curve. The plate is unstable with further crack growth because the rate of change in the
driving force exceeds the slope of the R curve.

The conditions for stable  crack growth can be expressed as follows:
(2.32a)
and
(2.32b)
Unstable  crack growth occurs when
(2.33)
When the resistance curve is ﬂat, as in Figure 2.10(a), one can deﬁne a critical value of
energy release rate Gc, unambiguously. A material with a rising R curve, however, cannot be
uniquely characterized with a single toughness value. According to Equation (2.33) a ﬂawed
structure fails when the driving force curve is tangent to the R curve, but this point of tangency
depends on the shape of the driving force curve, which depends on the conﬁguration of thestructure. The driving force curve for the through crack conﬁguration is linear, but G in the DCB
specimen (Example 2.2) varies with a
2; these two conﬁgurations would have different Gc values
for a given R curve.
Materials with rising R curves can be characterized by the value of G at the initiation of the
crack growth. Although the initiation toughness is usually not sensitive to structural geometry, thereare other problems with this measurement. It is virtually impossible to determine the precise momentof crack initiation in most materials. An engineering deﬁnition of initiation, analogous to the 0.2%offset yield strength in tensile tests, is usually required. Another limitation of initiation toughnessis that it characterizes only the onset of crack growth; it provides no information on the shape ofthe R curve.
2.5.1 R EASONS  FOR THE R CURVE SHAPE
Some materials exhibit a rising R curve, while the R curve for other materials is ﬂat. The shape of
the R curve depends on the material behavior and, to a lesser extent, on the conﬁguration of the
cracked structure.
The R curve for an ideally brittle material is ﬂat because the surface energy is an invariant
material property. When nonlinear material behavior accompanies fracture, however, the R curve
can take on a variety of shapes. For example, ductile fracture in metals usually results in a risingR curve; a plastic zone at the tip of the crack increases in size as the crack grows. The drivingforce must increase in such materials to maintain the crack growth. If the cracked body is inﬁnite(i.e., if the plastic zone is small compared to the relevant dimensions of the body) the plastic zonesize and R eventually reach steady-state values, and the R curve becomes ﬂat with further growth
(see Section 3.5.2).
Some materials can display a falling R curve. When a metal fails by cleavage, for example,
the material resistance is provided by the surface energy and local plastic dissipation, as illustratedin Figure 2.6(b). The R curve would be relatively ﬂat if the crack growth were stable. However,
cleavage propagation is normally unstable; the material near the tip of the growing crack is subjectto very high strain rates, which suppress plastic deformation. Thus, the resistance of a rapidlygrowing cleavage crack is less than the initial resistance at the onset of fracture.G=R

40 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The size and geometry of the cracked structure can exert some inﬂuence on the shape of the
R curve. A crack in a thin sheet tends to produce a steeper R curve than a crack in a thick plate
because there is a low degree of stress triaxiality at the crack tip in the thin sheet, while the
material near the tip of the crack in the thick plate may be in plane strain. The R curve can also
be affected if the growing crack approaches a free boundary in the structure. Thus, a wide platemay exhibit a somewhat different crack growth resistance behavior than a narrow plate of thesame material.
Ideally, the R curve, as well as other measures of fracture toughness, should be a property only
of the material and not depend on the size or shape of the cracked body. Much of fracture mechanicsis predicated on the assumption that fracture toughness is a material property. Conﬁgurationaleffects can occur, however. A practitioner of fracture mechanics should be aware of these effectsand their potential inﬂuence on the accuracy of an analysis. This issue is explored in detail inSection 2.10, Section 3.5, and Section 3.6.
2.5.2 L OAD CONTROL  VS. DISPLACEMENT  CONTROL
According to Equation (2.32) and Equation (2.33), the stability of crack growth depends on therate of change in G, i.e., the second derivative of potential energy. Although the driving force G is
the same for both load control and displacement control, the rate of change  of the driving force
curve depends on how the structure is loaded.
Displacement control tends to be more stable than load control. With some conﬁgurations, the
driving force actually decreases with crack growth in displacement control. A typical example isillustrated in Figure 2.11.
Referring to Figure 2.11, consider a cracked structure subjected to a load P
3 and a displacement
∆3. If the structure is load controlled, it is at the point of instability where the driving force curve
is tangent to the R curve. In displacement control, however, the structure is stable because the
driving force decreases with crack growth; the displacement must be increased for further crackgrowth.
When an R curve is determined experimentally, the specimen is usually tested in displacement
control, or as near to pure displacement control as is possible in the test machine. Since most ofthe common test specimen geometries exhibit falling driving force curves in displacement control,
FIGURE 2.11 Schematic driving force/ R curve diagram that compares load control and displacement control.
1656_C02.fm  Page 40  Thursday, April 14, 2005  6:28 PM
Linear Elastic F racture Mec hanics 41
it is possible to obtain a signiﬁcant amount of stable crack growth. If an instability occurs during
the test, the R curve cannot be deﬁned beyond the point of ultimate failure.
EXAMPLE 2.3
Evaluate the relative stability of a DCB specimen (Figure 2.9) in load control and displacement control.
Solution:  From the result derived in Example 2.2, the slope of the driving force curve in load control
is given by
In order to evaluate displacement control, it is necessary to express G in terms of ∆ and a. From beam
theory, load is related to displacement as follows:
Substituting the above equation into expression for energy release rate gives
Thus
Therefore, the driving force increases with crack growth in load control and decreases in displacement
control. For a ﬂat R curve, crack growth in load control is always unstable, while displacement control
is always stable.
2.5.3 S TRUCTURES  WITH FINITE COMPLIANCE
Most real structures are subject to conditions between load control and pure displacement
control. This intermediate situation can be schematically represented by a spring in series withthe ﬂawed structure (Figure 2.12). The structure is ﬁxed at a constant remote displacement ∆
T;
the spring represents the system compliance Cm. Pure displacement control corresponds to an
inﬁnitely stiff spring, where Cm. = 0. Load control (dead loading) implies an inﬁnitely soft
spring, i.e., Cm. = ∞. 
When the system compliance is ﬁnite, the point of fracture instability obviously lies somewhere
between the extremes of pure load control and pure displacement control. However, determiningthe precise point of instability requires a rather complex analysis.
At the moment of instability, the following conditions are satisﬁed:

2.6 STRESS ANAL YSIS OF CRA CKS
For certain cracked conﬁgurations subjected to external forces, it is possible to derive closed-form
expressions for the stresses in the body, assuming isotropic linear elastic material behavior. West-ergaard [8], Irwin [9], Sneddon [10], and Williams [11] were among the ﬁrst to publish suchsolutions. If we deﬁne a polar coordinate axis with the origin at the crack tip (Figure 2.13), it canbe shown that the stress ﬁeld in any linear elastic cracked body is given by

For the higher-order terms, Am is the amplitude and  is a dimensionless function of θ for
the mth term. The higher-order terms depend on geometry, but the solution for any given conﬁg-
uration contains a leading term that is proportional to .As r → 0, the leading term approaches
inﬁnity, but the other terms remain ﬁnite or approach zero. Thus, stress near the crack tip varies
with , regardless of the conﬁguration of the cracked body. It can also be shown that displace-ment near the crack tip varies with . Equation (2.36) describes a stress singularity , since stress
is asymptotic to r = 0. The basis of this relationship is explored in more detail in Appendix 2.3.
There are three types of loading that a crack can experience, as Figure 2.14 illustrates. Mode
I loading, where the principal load is applied normal to the crack plane, tends to open the crack.Mode II corresponds to in-plane shear loading and tends to slide one crack face with respect tothe other. Mode III refers to out-of-plane shear. A cracked body can be loaded in any one of thesemodes, or a combination of two or three modes.
2.6.1 T HE STRESS INTENSITY  FACTOR
Each mode of loading produces the  singularity at the crack tip, but the proportionality constantsk and f
ij depend on the mode. It is convenient at this point to replace k by the stress intensity factor
K, where . The stress intensity factor is usually given a subscript to denote the mode of
loading, i.e., KI, KII, or KIII. Thus, the stress ﬁelds ahead of a crack tip in an isotropic linear elasticFIGURE 2.13 Deﬁnition of the coordinate axis

Consider the Mode I singular ﬁeld on the crack plane, where θ = 0. According to Table 2.1,
the stresses in the x and y direction are equal:
(2.39)
When θ = 0, the shear stress is zero, which means that the crack plane is a principal plane for pure
Mode I loading. Figure 2.15 is a schematic plot of σyy, the stress normal to the crack plane vs. distance
from the crack tip. Equation (2.39) is valid only near the crack tip, where the  singularity
dominates the stress ﬁeld. Stresses far from the crack tip are governed by the remote boundaryconditions. For example, if the cracked structure is subjected to a uniform remote tensile stress, 
σyy
approaches a constant value σ∞. We can deﬁne a singularity-dominated zone  as the region where the
equations in Table 2.1 to Table 2.3 describe the crack-tip ﬁelds.
The stress intensity factor deﬁnes the amplitude of the crack-tip singularity. That is, stresses
near the crack tip increase in proportion to K. Moreover, the stress intensity factor completely
deﬁnes the crack tip conditions; if K is known, it is possible to solve for all components of stress,
strain, and displacement as a function of r and θ. This single-parameter description of crack tip
conditions turns out to be one of the most important concepts in fracture mechanics.
2.6.2 R ELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  K AND GLOBAL  BEHAVIOR
In order for the stress intensity factor to be useful, one must be able to determine K from remote
loads and the geometry. Closed-form solutions for K have been derived for a number of simpleTABLE 2.3

conﬁgurations. For more complex situations, the stress intensity factor can be estimated by experiment
or numerical analysis (see Chapter 12).
One conﬁguration for which a closed-form solution exists is a through crack in an inﬁnite plate
subjected to a remote tensile stress (Figure 2.3). Since the remote stress σ is perpendicular to the crack
plane, the loading is pure Mode I. Linear elastic bodies must undergo proportional stressing, i.e., allthe stress components at all locations increase in proportion to the remotely applied forces. Thus thecrack-tip stresses must be proportional to the remote stress, and K
I ∝ σ. According to Equation (2.37),
stress intensity has units of . Since the only relevant length scale in Figure 2.3 is thecrack size, the relationship between K
I and the global conditions must have the following form:
(2.40)
The actual solution, which is derived in Appendix 2.3, is given by
(2.41)
Thus the amplitude of the crack-tip singularity for this conﬁguration is proportional to the
remote stress and the square root of the crack size. The stress intensity factor for Mode II loadingof the plate in Figure 2.3 can be obtained by replacing 
σ in Equation (2.41) by the remotely applied
shear stress (see Figure 2.18 and Equation (2.43) below).
A related solution is that for a semi-inﬁnite plate with an edge crack (Figure 2.16). Note that
this conﬁguration can be obtained by slicing the plate in Figure 2.3 through the middle of the crack.The stress intensity factor for the edge crack is given by
(2.42)
which is similar to Equation (2.41). The 12% increase in K
I for the edge crack is caused by different
boundary conditions at the free edge. As Figure 2.17 illustrates, the edge crack opens more becauseit is less restrained than the through crack, which forms an elliptical shape when loaded.
Consider a through crack in an inﬁnite plate where the normal to the crack plane is oriented
at an angle 
β with the stress axis (Figure 2.18(a)). If , the crack experiences combined Mode
I and Mode II loading; KIII = 0 as long as the stress axis and the crack normal both lie in the plane
of the plate. If we redeﬁne the coordinate axis to coincide with the crack orientation (Figure 2.18(b)),we see that the applied stress can be resolved into normal and shear components. The stress normalto the crack plane, , produces pure Mode I loading, while 
τx′y′ applies Mode II loading to the
crack. The stress intensity factors for the plate in Figure 2.18 can be inferred by relating  and
τx′y′ to σ and β through Mohr’s circle:
(2.43a)
and 
(2.43b)
Note that Equation (2.43) reduces to the pure Mode I solution when β = 0. The maximum KII
occurs at β = 45°, where the shear stress is also at a maximum. Section 2.11 addresses fracture
under mixed mode conditions.stress length •

The penny-shaped crack in an inﬁnite medium (Figure 2.4) is another conﬁguration for which
a closed-form KI solution exists [11]:
(2.44)
where a is the crack radius. Note that Equation (2.44) has the same form as the previous relationships
for a through crack, except that the crack radius is the characteristic length in the above equation.
The more general case of an elliptical or semielliptical ﬂaw is illustrated in Figure 2.19. In thisinstance, two length dimensions are needed to characterize the crack size: 2 c and 2a, the major
and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively (see Figure 2.19). Also, when a < c, the stress intensity
factor varies along the crack front, with the maximum K
I at φ = 90°. The ﬂaw shape parameter Q
is obtained from an elliptic integral, as discussed in Appendix 2.4. Figure 2.19 gives an approximatesolution for Q. The surface correction factor 
λs is also an approximation.
2.6.3 E FFECT OF FINITE SIZE
Most conﬁgurations for which there is a closed-form K solution consist of a crack with a simple
shape (e.g., a rectangle or ellipse) in an inﬁnite plate. Stated another way, the crack dimensionsare small compared to the size of the plate; the crack-tip conditions are not inﬂuenced by externalboundaries. As the crack size increases, or as the plate dimensions decrease, the outer boundariesbegin to exert an inﬂuence on the crack tip. In such cases, a closed-form stress intensity solutionis usually not possible.FIGURE 2.18 Through crack in an inﬁnite plate for the general case where the principal stress is not

Consider a cracked plate subjected to a remote tensile stress. Figure 2.20 schematically illus-
trates the effect of ﬁnite width on the crack tip stress distribution, which is represented by lines of
force; the local stress is proportional to the spacing between lines of force. Since a tensile stresscannot be transmitted through a crack, the lines of force are diverted around the crack, resultingin a local stress concentration. In the inﬁnite plate, the line of force at a distance W from the crack
centerline has force components in the x and y directions. If the plate width is restricted to 2 W, the
x force must be zero on the free edge; this boundary condition causes the lines of force to becompressed, which results in a higher stress intensiﬁcation at the crack tip.FIGURE 2.19 Mode I stress intensity factors for elliptical and semielliptical cracks. These solutions are valid
only as long as the crack is small compared to the plate dimensions and a ≤ c.

One technique to approximate the ﬁnite width boundary condition is to assume a periodic array
of collinear cracks in an inﬁnite plate (Figure 2.21). The Mode I stress intensity factor for this
situation is given by
(2.45)
The stress intensity approaches the inﬁnite plate value as a/W approaches zero; KI is asymptotic
to a/W = 1. 
More accurate solutions for a through crack in a ﬁnite plate have been obtained from ﬁnite-element
analysis; solutions of this type are usually ﬁt to a polynomial expression. One such solution [12] is given by
(2.46)
Figure 2.22 compares the ﬁnite width corrections in Equation (2.45) and Equation (2.46). Thesecant term (without the polynomial term) in Equation (2.46) is also plotted. Equation (2.45) agreeswith the ﬁnite-element solution to within 7% for a/W < 0.6. The secant correction is much closer
to the ﬁnite element solution; the error is less than 2% for a/W < 0.9. Thus, the polynomial term
in Equation (2.46) contributes little and can be neglected in most cases.
Table 2.4 lists stress intensity solutions for several common conﬁgurations. These K
I solutions
are plotted in Figure 2.23. Several handbooks devoted solely to stress intensity solutions have beenpublished [12–14].FIGURE 2.20 Stress concentration effects due to a through crack in ﬁnite and inﬁnite width plates: (a)

Although stress intensity solutions are given in a variety of forms, K can always be related to
the through crack (Figure 2.4) through the appropriate correction factor:

The above equation can be expressed in the form of Equation (2.47):

In the limit of a small ﬂaw, the geometry correction factor in Table 2.4 becomes
Thus,
2.6.4 P RINCIPLE  OF SUPERPOSITION
For linear elastic materials, individual components of stress, strain, and displacement are additive.
For example, two normal stresses in the x direction imposed by different external forces can be
added to obtain the total σxx, but a normal stress cannot be summed with a shear stress. Similarly,
stress intensity factors are additive as long as the mode of loading is consistent. That is
but
In many instances, the principle of superposition allows stress intensity solutions for complex
conﬁgurations to be built from simple cases for which the solutions are well established. Consider,
for example, an edge-cracked panel (Table 2.4) subject to combined membrane (axial) loading Pm,
and three-point bending Pb. Since both types of loading impose pure Mode I conditions, the KI
values can be added:
(2.48)
where fm and fb are the geometry correction factors for membrane and bending loading, respectively,

EXAMPLE 2.5
Determine the stress intensity factor for a semielliptical surface crack subjected to an internal pressure
p (Figure 2.24(a)).
Solution: The principle of superposition enables us to construct the solution from known cases. One
relevant case is the semielliptical surface ﬂaw under uniform remote tension p (Figure 2.24(b)). If we
impose a uniform compressive stress −p on the crack surface (Figure 2.24(c)), KI = 0 because the crack
faces close, and the plate behaves as if the crack were not present. The loading conﬁguration of interest
is obtained by subtracting the stresses in Figure 2.24(c) from those of Figure 2.24(b):
Example 2.5 is a simple illustration of a more general concept, namely, stresses acting on the
boundary (i.e., tractions) can be replaced with tractions that act on the crack face, such that the two
loading conﬁgurations (boundary tractions vs. crack-face tractions) result in the same stress intensityfactor. Consider an uncracked body subject to a boundary traction P(x), as illustrated in Figure 2.25.
This boundary traction results in a normal stress distribution p(x) on Plane A-B. In order to conﬁne
the problem to Mode I, let us assume that no shear stresses act on Plane A-B. (This assumption ismade only for the sake of simplicity; the basic principle can be applied to all three modes ofloading.) Now assume that a crack that forms on Plane A-B and the boundary traction P(x) remains
ﬁxed, as Figure 2.26(a) illustrates. If we remove the boundary traction and apply a traction p(x)
on the crack face (Figure 2.26(b)), the principle of superposition indicates that the applied K
I will
be unchanged. That is

2.6.5 W EIGHT FUNCTIONS
When one performs an analysis to infer a stress intensity factor for a cracked body, the K value
that is computed applies only to one particular set of boundary conditions; different loading
conditions result in a different stress intensity factors for that geometry. It turns out, however, thatthe solution to one set of boundary conditions contains sufﬁcient information to infer K for any
other boundary conditions on that same geometry.
Consider two arbitrary loading conditions on an isotropic elastic cracked body in plane stress
or plane strain. For now, we assume that both loadings are symmetric with respect to the crackplane, such that pure Mode I loading is achieved in each case. Suppose that we know the stressintensity factor for loading (1) and we wish to solve for K
I(2), the stress intensity factor for the
second set of boundary conditions. Rice [15] showed that KI(1)and KI(2) are related as follows:

where Γ and A are the perimeter and area of the body, respectively, and ui are the displacements
in the x and y directions. Since loading systems (1) and (2) are arbitrary, it follows that KI(2) cannot
depend on KI(1) and ui(1). Therefore, the function
(2.50)
where xi represents the x and y coordinates, must be independent of the nature of loading system
(1). Bueckner [16] derived a similar result to Equation (2.50) two years before Rice, and referred
to h as a weight function .
Weight functions are ﬁrst-order tensors that depend only on the geometry of the cracked body.
Given the weight function for a particular conﬁguration, it is possible to compute KI from Equation
(2.49) for any boundary condition. Moreover, the previous section invoked the principle of super-position to show that any loading conﬁguration can be represented by appropriate tractions applieddirectly to the crack face. Thus K
I for a two-dimensional cracked body can be inferred from the
following expression:
(2.51)
where p(x) is the crack face traction (equal to the normal stress acting on the crack plane when the
body is uncracked) and Γc is the perimeter of the crack. The weight function h(x) can be interpreted
as the stress intensity resulting from a unit force applied to the crack face at x, and the above integral
represents the superposition of the KI values from discrete opening forces along the crack face.
EXAMPLE 2.6
Derive an expression for KI for an arbitrary traction on the face of a through crack in an inﬁnite plate.
Solution : We already know KI for this conﬁguration when a uniform tensile stress is applied:
where a is the half-crack length. From Equation (A2.43), the opening displacement of the crack faces
in this case is given by
where the x-y coordinate axis is deﬁned in Figure 2.27(a). Since the crack length is 2 a, we must
differentiate uy with respect to 2 a rather than a:

58 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
If we apply a surface traction of ±p(x) on the crack faces, the Mode I stress intensity factor for the two
crack tips is as follows:
The weight function concept is not restricted to two-dimensional bodies, Mode I loading, or
isotropic elastic materials. In their early work on weight functions, Rice [15] extended the theory
to three dimensions, Bueckner [16] considered combined Mode I /II loading, and both allowed for
anisotropy in the elastic properties. Subsequent researchers [17–22] have shown that the theoryapplies to all linear elastic bodies that contain an arbitrary number of cracks.
For mixed-mode problems, separate weight functions are required for each mode: h
I, hII, and
hIII. Since the stress intensity factors can vary along a three-dimensional crack front, the weight
functions also vary along the crack front. That is
(2.52)
where α(= 1, 2, 3) indicates the mode of loading and η is the crack front position.
Given that any loading conﬁguration in a cracked body can be represented by equivalent crack-
face tractions, the general mixed-mode, three-dimensional formulation of the weight functionapproach can be expressed in the following form:
(2.53)
where T
i are the tractions assumed to act on the crack surface Sc.
See Chapter 9 for examples of practical applications of weight functions.
2.7 RELA TIONSHIP BETWEEN K AND G
Two parameters that describe the behavior of cracks have been introduced so far: the energy releaserate and the stress intensity factor. The former parameter quantiﬁes the net change in potentialFIGURE 2.27 Through crack conﬁguration analyzed in Example 2.6: (a) deﬁnition of coordinate axes and

energy that accompanies an increment of crack extension; the latter quantity characterizes the
stresses, strains, and displacements near the crack tip. The energy release rate describes globalbehavior, while K is a local parameter. For linear elastic materials, K and G are uniquely related.
For a through crack in an inﬁnite plate subject to a uniform tensile stress (Figure 2.3), G and
K
I are given by Equation (2.24) and Equation (2.41), respectively. Combining these two equations
leads to the following relationship between G and KI for plane stress:
(2.54)
For plane strain conditions, E must be replaced by E/(1 − ν2). To avoid writing separate expressions
for plane stress and plane strain, the following notation will be adopted throughout this book:
for plane stress (2.55a)
and
for plane strain (2.55b)
Thus the G-KI relationship for both plane stress and plane strain becomes
(2.56)
Since Equation (2.24) and Equation (2.41) apply only to a through crack in an inﬁnite plate, we
have yet to prove that Equation (2.56) is a general relationship that applies to all conﬁgurations. Irwin [9]performed a crack closure analysis that provides such a proof. Irwin’s analysis is presented below.
Consider a crack of initial length a+∆a subject to Mode I loading, as illustrated in
Figure 2.28(a). It is convenient in this case to place the origin a distance ∆a behind the crack tip.

60 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Assume that the plate has a unit thickness. Let us now apply a compressive stress ﬁeld to the crack
faces between x = 0 and x = ∆a of sufﬁcient magnitude to close the crack in this region. The work
required to close the crack at the tip is related to the energy release rate:
(2.57)
where ∆U is the work of crack closure, which is equal to the sum of contributions to work from
x = 0 to x = ∆a:
(2.58)
and the incremental work at x is equal to the area under the force-displacement curve:
(2.59)
The factor of 2 on the work is required because both crack faces are displaced an absolute distanceu
y(x). The crack-opening displacement uy for Mode I is obtained from Table 2.2 by setting θ = π.
(2.60)
where KI(a + ∆a) denotes the stress intensity factor at the original crack tip. The normal stress
required to close the crack is related to KI for the shortened crack:
(2.61)
Combining Equation (2.57) to Equation (2.61) gives
(2.62)
Thus, Equation (2.56) is a general relationship for Mode I. The above analysis can be repeated forother modes of loading; the relevant closure stress and displacement for Mode II are, respectively,
τyx and ux, and the corresponding quantities for Mode III are τyz and uz. When all three modes of
loading are present, the energy release rate is given by
(2.63)
Contributions to G from the three modes are additive because energy release rate, like energy, is a
scalar quantity. Equation (2.63), however, assumes a self-similar crack growth, i.e., a planar crackG=∆

is assumed to remain planar and maintain a constant shape as it grows. Such is usually not the case
for mixed-mode fractures. See Section 2.11 for further discussion of energy release rate in mixed-mode problems.
2.8 CRA CK-TIP PLASTICITY
Linear elastic stress analysis of sharp cracks predicts inﬁnite stresses at the crack tip. In realmaterials, however, stresses at the crack tip are ﬁnite because the crack-tip radius must be ﬁnite(Section 2.2). Inelastic material deformation, such as plasticity in metals and crazing in polymers,leads to further relaxation of crack-tip stresses.
The elastic stress analysis becomes increasingly inaccurate as the inelastic region at the crack
tip grows. Simple corrections to linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are available whenmoderate crack-tip yielding occurs. For more extensive yielding, one must apply alternative crack-tip parameters that take nonlinear material behavior into account (see Chapter 3).
The size of the crack-tip-yielding zone can be estimated by two methods: the Irwin approach,
where the elastic stress analysis is used to estimate the elastic-plastic boundary, and the strip-yieldmodel. Both approaches lead to simple corrections for crack-tip yielding. The term plastic zone  usually
applies to metals, but will be adopted here to describe inelastic crack-tip behavior in a more generalsense. Differences in the yielding behavior between metals and polymers are discussed in Chapter 6.
2.8.1 T HE IRWIN APPROACH
On the crack plane ( θ = 0), the normal stress σyy in a linear elastic material is given by Equation
(2.39). As a ﬁrst approximation, we can assume that the boundary between elastic and plasticbehavior occurs when the stresses given by Equation (2.39) satisfy a yield criterion. For planestress conditions, yielding occurs when 
σyy=σYS, the uniaxial yield strength of the material.
Substituting yield strength into the left side of Equation (2.39) and solving for r gives a ﬁrst-order
estimate of the plastic zone size:
(2.64)
If we neglect strain hardening, the stress distribution for r = ry can be represented by a horizontal
line at σyy = σYS, as Figure 2.29 illustrates; the stress singularity is truncated by yielding at the
crack tip.
The simple analysis in the preceding paragraph is not strictly correct because it was based on
an elastic crack-tip solution. When yielding occurs, stresses must redistribute in order to satisfyequilibrium. The cross-hatched region in Figure 2.29 represents forces that would be present in anelastic material but cannot be carried in the elastic-plastic material because the stress cannot exceedthe yield. The plastic zone must increase in size in order to accommodate these forces. A simpleforce balance leads to a second-order estimate of the plastic zone size r
p: 
(2.65)
Integrating and solving for rp gives
(2.66)
which is twice as large as ry, the ﬁrst-order estimate.rK

Referring to Figure 2.29, the material in the plastic zone carries less stress than it would
otherwise carry if the material remained elastic. Irwin [23] accounted for the softer material in the
plastic zone by deﬁning an effective crack length that is slightly longer than the actual crack size.The effective crack length is deﬁned as the sum of the actual crack size and a plastic zone correction:
(2.67)
where r
y for plane stress is given by Equation (2.64). In plane strain, yielding is suppressed by the
triaxial stress state, and the Irwin plastic zone correction is smaller by a factor of 3:
(2.68)
The effective stress intensity is obtained by inserting aeff into the K expression for the geometry
of interest:
(2.69)
Since the effective crack size is taken into account in the geometry correction factor Y, an iterative
solution is usually required to solve for Keff. That is, K is ﬁrst determined in the absence of a
plasticity correction; a ﬁrst-order estimate of aeff is then obtained from Equation (2.64) or Equation
(2.68), which in turn is used to estimate Keff. A new aeff is computed from the Keff estimate, and the
process is repeated until successive Keff estimates converge. Typically, no more than three or four
iterations are required for reasonable convergence.
In certain cases, this iterative procedure is unnecessary because a closed-form solution is
possible. For example, the effective Mode I stress intensity factor for a through crack in an inﬁniteplate in plane stress is given by

Elliptical and semielliptical ﬂaws (Figure 2.20) also have an approximate closed-form plastic zone
correction, provided the ﬂaw is small compared to the plate dimensions. In the case of the embeddedelliptical ﬂaw, K
eff is given by
(2.71)
where Qeff is the effective ﬂaw shape parameter deﬁned as
(2.72)
Equation (2.72) must be multiplied by a surface correction factor for a semielliptical surface
ﬂaw (see Figure 2.20). 
One interpretation of the Irwin plastic zone adjustment is that of an effective compliance .
Figure 2.30 compares the load-displacement behavior of a purely elastic cracked plate with that ofa cracked plate with a plastic zone at the tip. The load-displacement curve for the latter case deviatesfrom the purely elastic curve as the load increases. At a given load P, the displacement for the plate
with a plastic zone is greater than that of the elastic plate; referring to Figure 2.30, ∆
2 > ∆1. One
can deﬁne an effective compliance as follows:
Therefore, aeff in this instance can be viewed as the crack length that results in the compliance
Ceff in a purely elastic material.
Finally, it should be noted that the author does not recommend using the Irwin plastic zone
adjustment for practical applications. It was presented here primarily to provide a historical contextto the development of both linear and nonlinear fracture mechanics. See Chapter 9 for recommendedapproaches for handling plasticity effects.

2.8.2 T HE STRIP-YIELD MODEL
The strip-yield model, which is illustrated in Figure 2.31, was ﬁrst proposed by Dugdale [24] and
Barenblatt [25]. They assumed a long, slender plastic zone at the crack tip in a nonhardeningmaterial in plane stress. These early analyses considered only a through crack in an inﬁnite plate.The strip-yield plastic zone is modeled by assuming a crack of length 2 a + 2
ρ, where ρ is the
length of the plastic zone, with a closure stress equal to σYS applied at each crack tip (Figure 2.31(b)).
This model approximates elastic-plastic behavior by superimposing two elastic solutions: a
through crack under remote tension and a through crack with closure stresses at the tip. Thus thestrip-yield model is a classical application of the principle of superposition.
Since the stresses are ﬁnite in the strip-yield zone, there cannot be a stress singularity at the
crack tip. Therefore, the leading term in the crack-tip ﬁeld that varies with (Equation (2.36))must be zero. The plastic zone length 
ρ must be chosen such that the stress intensity factors from
the remote tension and closure stress cancel one another.
The stress intensity due to the closure stress can be estimated by considering a normal force
P applied to the crack at a distance x from the centerline of the crack (Figure 2.32). The stress
intensities for the two crack tips are given by
(2.73a)

Thus, the total stress intensity at each crack tip resulting from the closure stresses is obtained by
replacing a with a + ρ in Equation (2.73) and summing the contribution from both crack tips:
(2.75)
Solving this integral gives
(2.76)
The stress intensity from the remote tensile stress, , must balance with Kclosure.
Therefore,
(2.77)
Note that ρ approaches inﬁnity as . Let us explore the strip-yield model further by
performing a Taylor series expansion on Equation (2.77):
(2.78)
Neglecting all but the ﬁrst two terms and solving for the plastic zone size gives
(2.79)
for σ << σYS. Note the similarity between Equation (2.79) and Equation (2.66); since 1/ π = 0.318
and π/8 = 0.392, the Irwin and strip-yield approaches predict similar plastic zone sizes.
One way to estimate the effective stress intensity with the strip-yield model is to set aeff equal
to a + ρ:
(2.80)
However, Equation (2.80) tends to overestimate Keff; the actual aeff is somewhat less than a + ρ
because the strip-yield zone is loaded to σYS. Burdekin and Stone [26] obtained a more realistic
estimate of Keff for the strip-yield model

2.8.3 C OMPARISON  OF PLASTIC  ZONE CORRECTIONS
Figure 2.33 shows a comparison between a pure LEFM analysis (Equation (2.41)), the Irwin
correction for plane stress (Equation (2.70)), and the strip-yield correction on stress intensity(Equation (2.81)). The effective stress intensity, nondimensionalized by , is plotted againstthe normalized stress. The LEFM analysis predicts a linear relationship between K and stress. Both
the Irwin and strip-yield corrections deviate from the LEFM theory at stresses greater than 0.5
σYS.
The two plasticity corrections agree with each other up to approximately 0.85 σYS. According to the
strip-yield model, Keff is inﬁnite at yield; the strip-yield zone extends completely across the plate,
which has reached its maximum load capacity.
The plastic zone shape predicted by the strip-yield model bears little resemblance to actual
plastic zones in metals (see Section 2.8.4), but many polymers produce crack-tip craze zones thatlook very much like Figure 2.31. Thus, although Dugdale originally proposed the strip-yield modelto account for yielding in thin steel sheets, this model is better suited to polymers (see Chapter 6). 
In the 1970s, the strip-yield model was used to derive a practical methodology for assessing
fracture in structural components. This approach is called the failure assessment diagram (FAD)and is described in Chapter 9.
2.8.4 P LASTIC  ZONE SHAPE
The estimates of plastic zone size that have been presented so far consider only the crack plane
θ  = 0. It is possible to estimate the extent of plasticity at all angles by applying an appropriate
yield criterion to the equations in Table 2.1 and Table 2.3. Consider the von Mises equation:

where σe is the effective stress, and σ1, σ2, and σ3 are the three principal normal stresses. According
to the von Mises criterion, yielding occurs when σe = σYS, the uniaxial yield strength. For plane
stress or plane strain conditions, the principal stresses can be computed from the two-dimensional

(2.85a)
for plane stress, and
(2.85b)
for plane strain. Equation (2.85a) and Equation (2.85b), which are plotted in Figure 2.34(a), deﬁnethe approximate boundary between elastic and plastic behavior. The corresponding equations forModes II and III are plotted in Figure 2.34(b) and Figure 2.34(c), respectively.
Note the signiﬁcant difference in the size and shape of the Mode I plastic zones for plane stress
and plane strain. The latter condition suppresses yielding, resulting in a smaller plastic zone for agiven K
I value.
Equation (2.85a) and Equation (2.85b) are not strictly correct because they are based on a
purely elastic analysis. Recall Figure 2.29, which schematically illustrates how crack-tip plasticitycauses stress redistribution, which is not taken into account in Figure 2.34. The Irwin plasticitycorrection, which accounts for stress redistribution by means of an effective crack length, is alsosimplistic and not totally correct.
Figure 2.35 compares the plane strain plastic zone shape predicted from Equation (2.85b) with
a detailed elastic-plastic crack-tip stress solution obtained from the ﬁnite element analysis. Thelatter, which was published by Dodds et al. [27], assumed a material with the following uniaxialstress-strain relationship:

where εo, σo, α, and n are material constants. We will examine the above relationship in more detail
in Chapter 3. For now, it is sufﬁcient to note that the exponent n characterizes the strain-hardening
rate of a material. Dodds et al. analyzed materials with n = 5, 10, and 50, which corresponds to
high, medium, and low strain-hardening, respectively. Figure 2.35 shows the contours of constant
σe for n = 50. The deﬁnition of the elastic-plastic boundary is somewhat arbitrary, since materials
that can be described by Equation (2.86) do not have a deﬁnite yield point. When the plastic zone
boundary is deﬁned at σe = σYS (the 0.2% offset yield strength), the plane strain plastic zone is
considerably smaller than predicted by Equation (2.85b). Deﬁning the boundary at a slightly lower                             (a) (b)

effective stress results in a much larger plastic zone. Given the difﬁculties of deﬁning the plastic
zone unambiguously with a detailed analysis, the estimates of the plastic zone size and shape fromthe elastic analysis (Figure 2.34) appear to be reasonable.
Figure 2.36 illustrates the effect of strain hardening on the plastic zone. A high strain-hardening
rate results in a smaller plastic zone because the material inside of the plastic zone is capable ofcarrying higher stresses, and less stress redistribution is necessary.
2.9K-CONTROLLED FRACTURE
Section 2.6.1 introduced the concept of the singularity-dominated zone and alluded to single-parameter characterization of crack-tip conditions. The stresses near the crack tip in a linear elasticmaterial vary as ; the stress intensity factor deﬁnes the amplitude of the singularity. Given theequations in Table 2.1 to Table 2.3, one can completely deﬁne the stresses, strains, and displacementsin the singularity-dominated zone if the stress intensity factor is known. If we assume a materialfails locally at some combination of stresses and strains, then crack extension must occur at acritical K value. This K
crit value, which is a measure of fracture toughness , is a material constant
that is independent of the size and geometry of the cracked body. Since energy release rate isuniquely related to stress intensity (Section 2.7), G also provides a single-parameter description of
crack-tip conditions, and G
c is an alternative measure of toughness.
The foregoing discussion does not consider plasticity or other types of nonlinear material
behavior at the crack tip. Recall that the singularity applies only to linear elastic materials. Theequations in Table 2.1 to Table 2.3 do not describe the stress distribution inside the plastic zone. Asdiscussed in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, the microscopic events that lead to fracture in various materialsgenerally occur well within the plastic zone (or damage zone, to use a more generic term). Thus,even if the plastic zone is very small, fracture may not nucleate in the singularity-dominated zone.This fact raises an important question: Is stress intensity a useful failure criterion in materials thatexhibit inelastic deformation at the crack tip?
Under certain conditions, K still uniquely characterizes crack-tip conditions when a plastic zone
is present. In such cases, K
crit is a geometry-independent material constant, as discussed below.
Consider a test specimen and structure loaded to the same KI level, as illustrated in Figure 2.37.
Assume that the plastic zone is small compared to all the length dimensions in the structure andtest specimen. Let us construct a free-body diagram with a small region removed from the crack tipof each material. If this region is sufﬁciently small to be within the singularity-dominated zone,the stresses and displacements at the boundary are deﬁned by the relationships in Table 2.1 andTable 2.2. The disc-shaped region in Figure 2.37 can be viewed as an independent problem. Theimposition of the singularity at the boundary results in a plastic zone at the crack tip. Thesize of the plastic zone and the stress distribution within the disc-shaped region are a function onlyof the boundary conditions and material properties. Therefore, even though we do not know theactual stress distribution in the plastic zone, we can argue that it is uniquely characterized by theFIGURE 2.36 Effect of strain-hardening on the
Mode I plastic zone; n = 5 corresponds to a high strain-
hardening material, while n = 50 corresponds to very
low hardening (cf. Equation (2.86)).

boundary conditions, i.e., KI characterizes crack-tip conditions even though the singularity
does not apply to the plastic zone. Since the structure and test specimen in Figure 2.37 are loaded
to the same KI value, the crack-tip conditions must be identical in the two conﬁgurations. Further-
more, as the load is increased, both conﬁgurations will fail at the same critical stress intensity,provided the plastic zone remains small in each case. Similarly, if both structures are loaded infatigue at the same ∆K, the crack-growth rates will be similar as long as the cyclic plastic zone is
embedded within the singularity-dominated zone in each case (see Chapter 10).
Figure 2.38 schematically illustrates the stress distributions in the structure and test specimen from
the previous ﬁgure. In the singularity-dominated zone, a log-log plot of the stress distribution is linearwith a slope of −1/2. Inside of the plastic zone, the stresses are lower than predicted by the elastic
solution, but are identical for the two conﬁgurations. Outside of the singularity-dominated zone, higher-order terms become signiﬁcant (Equation (2.36)) and the stress ﬁelds are different for the structure andtest specimen. K does not uniquely characterize the magnitude of the higher-order terms.FIGURE 2.37 Schematic test specimen and structure loaded to the same stress intensity. The crack-tip
conditions should be identical in both conﬁgurations as long as the plastic zone is small compared to all
relevant dimensions. Thus, both will fail at the same critical K value.

Linear Elastic F racture Mec hanics 71
As the plastic zone increases in size, it eventually engulfs the singularity zone, and there is no
longer a region where the stress varies as . In such cases, K no longer characterizes stresses
near the crack tip. What this means in practical terms is that LEFM is not valid once the plastic
zone size becomes large relative to key dimensions such as the crack size.
EXAMPLE 2.7
Estimate the relative size of the singularity-dominated zone ahead of a through crack in an inﬁnite plate
subject to remote uniaxial tension (Figure 2.3). The full solution for the stresses on the crack plane ( θ = 0)
for this geometry are as follows (see Appendix 2.3.2):
where σ is the remotely applied tensile stress. Also, estimate the value of KI where the plane strain
plastic zone engulfs the singularity-dominated zone.
Solution : As r → 0 both of the above relationships reduce to the expected result:
Figure 2.39 is a plot of the ratio of the total stress to the singular stress given by the above equation.
Note that the stress in the y direction is close to the singular limit to relatively large distances from the
crack tip, but the x stress diverges considerably from the near-tip limit. When r/a = 0.02, the singularity
approximation results in roughly a 2% underestimate of σyy and a 20% overestimate of σxx. Let us
arbitrarily deﬁne this point as the limit of the singularity zone:
By setting the plane strain plastic zone size estimate (Equation (2.63)) equal to a/50, we obtain an
estimate of the KI value at which the singularity zone is engulfed by crack-tip plasticity:FIGURE 2.38 Crack-tip stress ﬁelds for the specimen and structure in Figure 2.37.

Therefore, when the nominal stress exceeds approximately 35% of yield in this case, the accuracy of
KI as a crack-tip–characterizing parameter in this particular geometry is suspect.1
2.10 PLANE STRAIN FRACTURE: FA CT VS. FICTION
In the 1960s, massive testing programs were undertaken by NASA and other organizations in an effort
to develop experimental procedures for measuring fracture toughness in high strength materials. Amongthe variables that were considered in these studies were the dimensions of the test specimen. 
The NASA data exhibited an apparent effect of specimen thickness on the critical stress intensity
for fracture, K
crit. The explanation that was originally offered was that thin specimens are subject
to plane stress loading at the crack tip, while thick specimens experience plane strain conditions.The biaxial stress state associated with plane stress, it was argued, results in a higher measuredtoughness than is observed in the same material when subject to a triaxial stress state. Failure inthin sections was referred to as “plane stress fracture,” while the term “plane strain fracture” wasFIGURE 2.39 Ratio of actual stresses on the crack plane to the singularity limit in an inﬁnite plate with a
through-thickness crack (Example 2.7).
1The singularity zone is small in this geometry because of a signiﬁcant transverse compressive stress. In cracked geometries
loaded in bending, this transverse stress (also called the T stress) is near zero or slightly positive; consequently, the singularity
zone is larger in these conﬁgurations. See Section 3.6 for a further discussion on the effect of the T stress.

applied to toughness tests on thick sections. This two-dimensional viewpoint, which is still prevalent
in textbooks and published literature, is simplistic and misleading.
Much of the classical fracture mechanics theory is predicated on two-dimensional approxima-
tions. For example, the relationship between KI and energy release rate (Equation (2.56)) is
rigorously correct only for the special cases of plane stress and plane strain. There are cases wherea two-dimensional model is appropriate, but there are other instances where a two-dimensionaloutlook gives a distorted view of reality. The relationship between specimen dimensions andapparent fracture toughness is an example of the latter.
In the 1960s, when “plane stress fracture” and “plane strain fracture” mechanisms were ﬁrst
postulated, a detailed three-dimensional analysis of the stress state in front of a crack was simplynot possible. Today, three-dimensional ﬁnite element analyses of components with cracks arecommonplace (Chapter 12). Advances in computer technology have signiﬁcantly aided in ourunderstanding of the behavior of material at the tip of a crack.
This section presents an updated perspective on the interrelationship between specimen dimen-
sions, crack-tip triaxiality, and fracture toughness.
2.10.1 C RACK-TIP TRIAXIALITY
Consider a cracked plate with thickness B subject to in-plane loading, as illustrated in Figure 2.40.
If there was no crack, the plate would be in a state of plane stress. Thus, regions of the plate thatare sufﬁciently far from the crack tip must also be loaded in plane stress. Material near the cracktip is loaded to higher stresses than the surrounding material. Because of the large stress normalto the crack plane, the crack-tip material tries to contract in the x and z directions, but is prevented
from doing so by the surrounding material. This constraint causes a triaxial state of stress near thecrack-tip, as Figure 2.40 illustrates.
Figure 2.41 is a schematic plot of the stress parallel to the crack front, 
σzz, in the plate depicted
in Figure 2.40. In the interior of the plate, the z stress, and therefore the level of triaxiality, is high.
The stress state in this central region is essentially plane strain at distances from the crack tip thatare small compared to the plate thickness. Near the free surface, the stress triaxiality is lower, buta state of pure plane stress exists only at the free surface.
FIGURE 2.40 Three-dimensional deformation at the tip of a crack. The high normal stress at the crack tip causes
material near the surface to contract, but material in the interior is constrained, resulting in a triaxial stress state.
1656_C02.fm  Page 73  Thursday, April 14, 2005  6:28 PM
74 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Figure 2.42 is a plot of σzz as a function of z/B and x/B. These results were obtained from a
three-dimensional elastic-plastic ﬁnite element analysis performed by Narasimhan and Rosakis
[28]. Material near the crack tip experiences high triaxiality, but σzz = 0 when x is a signiﬁcant
fraction of the plate thickness. Therefore, plane stress conditions exist remote from the crack tip,but the stress state close to the crack tip is essentially plane strain in the interior of the plate.
2
The stress state can have a signiﬁcant effect on the fracture behavior of a given material. To
illustrate this effect, consider a point on the crack plane ( θ = 0) just ahead of the crack-tip.
According to Equation (2.39), σxx = σyy under linear elastic conditions. If the stress state is planeFIGURE 2.41 Schematic variation of transverse stress and strain through the thickness at a point near the
crack tip.
2Under plane strain loading, the quantity σzz/(σxx + σyy) is equal to Poisson’s ratio for elastic material behavior and is
equal to 0.5 for incompressible plastic deformation. Therefore, the curve for x/B = 0.005 in Figure 2.42 is inside the plastic
zone at ( KI/σYS) = 0.96B.FIGURE 2.42 Transverse stress through the thickness as a function of distance from the crack tip [28].

Linear Elastic F racture Mec hanics 75
stress, σzz = 0 by deﬁnition. Under plain strain conditions, σzz = 2νσyy. Substituting these stresses
into the von Mises yield criterion (Equation (2.82)) leads to the following:
(2.87)
assuming ν = 0.3. Therefore, the triaxial stress state associated with plane strain leads to higher stresses
in the plastic zone. For fracture mechanisms that are governed by normal stress, such as cleavage in
metals (Section 5.2), the material will behave in a more brittle fashion when subjected to a triaxial stressstate. Triaxial stresses also assist ductile fracture processes such as microvoid coalescence (Section 5.1).
2.10.2 E FFECT OF THICKNESS  ON APPARENT  FRACTURE  TOUGHNESS
Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44 show two sets of data that have commonly been used to illustratethickness effects on fracture toughness [29]. The measured K
crit values decrease with specimen
thickness until a plateau is reached, at which point the toughness appears to be relatively insensitiveto further increase in thickness. This apparent asymptote in the toughness vs. thickness trend isdesignated by the symbol K
Ic, and is referred to as “plane strain fracture toughness” [30, 31]. A
KIc value is purported to be a specimen-size–independent material property.3 
In the past, the decreasing trend in Kcrit with increasing thickness in Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44
was attributed to a transition from plane stress to plane strain at the crack tip. Although this trend
3In reality, fracture toughness, as it is deﬁned standardized KIc test methods, does not usually exhibit a true asymptote with
increasing specimen size. Refer to Section 7.2 for a detailed discussion of the KIc test.FIGURE 2.43 Variation of measured fracture toughness with specimen thickness for an unspeciﬁed alloy.

is related to the crack-tip stress state, the traditional plane stress–plane strain transition model is
far too simplistic.
Plots such as Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44, that show a decrease in apparent toughness with
specimen thickness, generally correspond to materials in which the crack propagation is ductile(microvoid coalescence). In such tests, the crack “tunnels” through the center of the specimen.That is, the crack grows preferentially in the region of high triaxiality. Crack growth on the outerregions of the specimen lags behind, and occurs at a 45 ° angle to the applied load. The resulting
fracture surface exhibits a ﬂat region in the central region and 45 ° shear lips on the edges. Section
5.1 provides additional information on crack tunneling and the formation of shear lips. Figure 2.45FIGURE 2.44 Variation of measured fracture toughness with specimen thickness for 7075-T6 Aluminum.

illustrates the fracture surface morphology for three specimen thicknesses. Fracture toughness tests
on very thin plates or sheets typically result in a 45 ° shear fracture. At larger thicknesses, there is
generally some mixture of shear fracture and ﬂat fracture. The thickness effect on the apparentfracture toughness is due to the relative portions of ﬂat and shear fracture. In the limit of a verythick specimen, the ﬂat fracture mechanism dominates, and further increases in thickness haverelatively little effect on the measured toughness.
The stress distribution depicted in Figure 2.41 is characteristic of all section thicknesses. A
central plane strain region can exist even in thin sheet specimens, as long as the distance from thecrack-tip is sufﬁciently small. Pure slant fracture occurs when the distance over which hightriaxiality conditions exist is smaller than the fracture process zone, which is a function of micro-structural parameters such as inclusion spacing. Figure 2.46 illustrates the concept of a fractureprocess zone. The micromechanical processes that lead to ductile crack extensions occur over aﬁnite distance x
c, which typically is much less than the plastic zone size. Figure 2.47 illustrates the
effect of thickness on the crack-tip stress state at x = xc. For very thin sections, plane strain conditions
do not exist at x = xc. As the thickness increases, the size of the plane strain zone increases relative
to the low triaxiality zone near the free surfaces. It is this stress state that results in the varyingfracture surface morphology depicted in Figure 2.45, which in turn leads to the apparent thicknessdependence of fracture toughness shown in Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44.
To summarize, the trends in Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44 are not indicative of a transition from
“plane stress fracture” to “plane strain fracture.” Rather, this trend reﬂects the differing relativecontributions of two distinct fracture mechanisms. In point of fact, there is no such thing as “planestress fracture” except perhaps in very thin foil. There is nearly always some level of triaxialityalong the crack front.
The shear lips, that cause the apparent thickness dependence of toughness in materials that exhibit
ductile crack growth, are an artifact of the way in which K
Ic tests have been conducted since the early
1960s. More recent fracture toughness test methods typically use side-grooved specimens (Section 7.1).This specimen design eliminates shear lips and provides an accurate measure of the resistance of thematerial to ﬂat, ductile fracture. The apparent thickness dependence of toughness observed in Figure 2.43and Figure 2.44 would disappear if the same materials were tested with side-grooved specimens.FIGURE 2.46 Fracture process zone at the tip of a
crack.

1656_C02.fm  Page 77  Thursday, April 14, 2005  6:28 PM
78 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Fracture toughness specimens that fail by cleavage fracture usually do not form shear lips, so
the trends in Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44 do not apply to such data. Cleavage fracture toughness
does exhibit a slight thickness-dependence due to weakest-link sampling effects. See Section 5.2for a detailed discussion of this fracture mechanism.
2.10.3 P LASTIC  ZONE EFFECTS
Section 2.9 outlines the conditions required for K-controlled fractures. The plastic zone must be
embedded within an elastic singularity zone in order for K to characterize crack-tip conditions.
Traditionally, the loss of K dominance with plastic zone growth has been lumped together with the
purported transition from “plane strain fracture” to “plane stress fracture,” as if these phenomenawere synonymous. In fact, there is not a direct correspondence between the plastic zone size andthe existence (or absence) of plane strain conditions near the crack tip. Three-dimensional elastic-plastic ﬁnite element analyses of standard laboratory fracture toughness specimens have shownthat a high degree of triaxiality near the crack tip exists even when the entire cross-section hasyielded. Although K is not valid as a characterizing parameter under fully plastic conditions, a
single-parameter description of fracture toughness is still possible using the J integral, or crack-
tip-opening displacement (Chapter 3).
Figure 2.48 shows the evolution of the Mode I plastic zone at mid-thickness in a plate containing
an edge crack. These results were obtained from a three-dimensional elastic-plastic ﬁnite elementanalysis performed by Nakamura and Parks [32]. The plastic zone boundary is deﬁned at 
σe = σYS
in this case. As the quantity  increases relative to plate thickness B, the plastic zone size
increases, as one would expect. What is interesting about these results is the change in plastic zoneshape. At low K
I values, the plastic zone has a typical plane strain shape, but evolves into a plane
stress shape at higher KI values (Figure 2.34(a)). This transition can be understood by referring to
Figure 2.42. At distances from the crack tip on the order of half the plate thickness, σzz = 0. As a
result, the plastic zone takes on a plane stress shape when it grows to approximately half the plate
FIGURE 2.48 Effect of KI, relative to thickness, of the plastic zone size and shape. Taken from Nakamura,

thickness. Although the stress state at the plastic zone boundary is plane stress, the material close
to the crack tip is subject to a triaxial stress state. This is illustrated in Figure 2.49, which depictsa plastic zone in the center of an edge-cracked plate. Because the plastic zone size in Figure 2.49is of the same order of magnitude as the plate thickness, the plastic zone has a plane stress shape.At the crack tip, however, there is a zone of high triaxiality. As stated above, the zone of hightriaxiality at the crack tip can persist even in the presence of large-scale plasticity.
When performing laboratory K
Ic tests on standard specimens, such as those illustrated in
Table 2.4, the following size requirements have been adopted [30, 31]:
(2.88)
Recall that the quantity  is proportional to the plastic zone size. The minimum require-ments on the crack length and ligament length ( W – a) are designed to ensure that the plastic zone
is sufﬁciently small for fracture to be K-controlled. The thickness requirement, which is based on
experimental data such as Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44, is intended to ensure plane strain conditionsalong the crack front. As stated earlier, however, the apparent thickness dependence in fracturetoughness is a result of the relative mixtures of ﬂat fracture and shear fracture, and side grooveswould eliminate this effect. The thickness requirement in Equation (2.88) is far more stringent thanis necessary to ensure plane strain conditions along the majority of the crack front.
2.10.4 I MPLICATIONS  FOR CRACKS  IN STRUCTURES
A ﬁnal, very important point is that the observed thickness dependence of fracture toughness inlaboratory tests is usually not directly transferable to structural components. For example,Figure 2.50 schematically compares the crack-tip stress state of a laboratory fracture toughnessFIGURE 2.49 Cracked plate in which the plastic zone size is of the same order of magnitude as the plate
thickness. The plastic zone at mid thickness has a plane stress shape, but there is a zone of high triaxiality
close to the crack tip.

specimen with that of a surface crack in a structural component. In the case of the test specimen,
the relative size of the high-triaxiality zone is directly related to the thickness. For the surface ﬂaw,however, the size of the high-triaxiality zone is governed by the crack front length, which need notbe related in any way to the section thickness. A standard laboratory specimen and a surface crackwould not necessarily produce the same fracture morphology (e.g., the relative fractions of ﬂatfracture vs. shear fracture). The observed trends in Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44 cannot legitimatelybe used to predict the fracture behavior of structural components.
In 1967, Irwin et al. [33] developed a simple empirical relationship to describe the trends in
Figure 2.43 and Figure 2.44, as well as other similar data sets:
(2.89)
where K
crit is the measured fracture toughness for thinner sections, KIc is the presumed asymptotic
fracture toughness for large section thicknesses, and
(2.90)
Unfortunately, this empirical ﬁt to a few data sets has been grossly misused over the years. Equation(2.89) has often been applied to structural components in an effort to account for the presumedimprovement in toughness in thinner sections. As Figure 2.50 illustrates, however, the stress stateat the tip of a surface crack is not directly related to the plate thickness.
Equation (2.89) is suitable only for edge-cracked laboratory specimens that exhibit shear lips on
the fracture surface, as Figure (2.45) illustrates. It does not apply to ﬂaws in structural components,nor does it apply to side-grooved laboratory specimens or specimens that fail by cleavage.
2.11 MIXED-MODE FRACTURE
When two or more modes of loading are present, Equation (2.63) indicates that the energy releaserate contributions from each mode are additive. This equation assumes self-similar crack growth,however. Consider the angled crack problem depicted in Figure 2.18. Equation (2.63) givesthe energy release rate for planar crack growth at an angle 90 ° − 
β from the applied stress.FIGURE 2.50 Schematic comparison of a laboratory specimen with a ﬂaw in a structural component. In the

Figure 2.51 illustrates a more typical scenario for an angled crack. When fracture occurs, the crack
tends to propagate orthogonal to the applied normal stress; i.e., the mixed-mode crack becomes a
Mode I crack.
A propagating crack seeks the path of least resistance (or the path of maximum driving force)
and need not be conﬁned to its initial plane. If the material is isotropic and homogeneous, the crackwill propagate in such a way as to maximize the energy release rate. What follows is an evaluationof the energy release rate as a function of propagation direction in mixed-mode problems. OnlyMode I and Mode II are considered here, but the basic methodology can, in principle, be appliedto a more general case where all three modes are present. This analysis is based on similar workin Refs. [34–36].
2.11.1 P ROPAGATION  OF AN ANGLED  CRACK
We can generalize the angled through-thickness crack of Figure 2.18 to any planar crack oriented
90° − β from the applied normal stress. For uniaxial loading, the stress intensity factors for Mode I
and Mode II are given by 
(2.91a)
(2.91b)
where KI(0) is the Mode I stress intensity when β = 0. The crack-tip stress ﬁelds (in polar coordinates)
for the Mode I portion of the loading are given by

(2.92b)
(2.92c)FIGURE 2.51 Typical propagation from an initial
crack that is not orthogonal to the applied normal
stress. The loading for the initial angled crack is acombination of Mode I and Mode II, but the cracktends to propagate normal to the applied stress, result-ing in pure Mode I loading.

are given by

Suppose that the crack in question forms an inﬁnitesimal kink at an angle α from the plane of the
crack, as Figure 2.52 illustrates. The local stress intensity factors at the tip of this kink differ from
the nominal K values of the main crack. If we deﬁne a local x-y coordinate system at the tip of the
kink and assume that Equation (2.92) and Equation (2.93) deﬁne the local stress ﬁelds, the localMode I and Mode II stress intensity factors at the tip are obtained by summing the normal andshear stresses, respectively, at 
α:

The energy release rate for the kinked crack is given by
(2.96)
Figure 2.53 is a plot of G(α) normalized by G(α = 0). The peak in G(α) at each β corresponds to
the point where kI exhibits a maximum and kII = 0. Thus, the maximum energy release rate is given by
(2.97)
where α* is the angle at which both G and kI exhibit a maximum and kII = 0. Crack growth in a
homogeneous material should initiate along α*.
Figure 2.54 shows the effect of β on the optimum propagation angle. The dashed line corre-
sponds to propagation perpendicular to the remote principal stress. Note that the Gmax criterion
implies an initial propagation plane that differs slightly from the normal to the remote stress.
2.11.2 E QUIVALENT  MODE I CRACK
Let us now introduce an effective Mode I crack that results in the same stress intensity and energy
release rate as a crack oriented at an angle β and propagating at an angle α*:

For the special case of a through-thickness crack in an inﬁnite plate (Figure 2.18), Equation (2.98)becomes

The maximum local stress intensity factor and energy release rate occurs at the optimum propagation
angle α*, which depends on the biaxiality ratio. Figure 2.56 illustrates the effect of B and β on the
propagation angle. Note that when B > 0 and β = 90°, propagation occurs in the crack plane ( α* = 0),
since the crack lies on a principal plane and is subject to pure Mode I loading.FIGURE 2.55 Cracked plane subject to a biaxial stress state.

2.12 INTERA CTION OF MULTIPLE CRACKS
The local stress ﬁeld and crack driving force for a given ﬂaw can be signiﬁcantly affected by the
presence of one or more neighboring cracks. Depending on the relative orientation of the neighboringcracks, the interaction can either magnify or diminish the stress intensity factor. An example of theformer is an inﬁnite array of coplanar cracks (Figure 2.21). The K
I solution for this conﬁguration is
given by Equation (2.45) and is plotted in Figure 2.22. When cracks are parallel to one another, KI
tends to decrease due to the interaction. The interaction of both coplanar and parallel cracks isdiscussed further in the following section.
2.12.1 C OPLANAR  CRACKS
Figure 2.57 illustrates two identical coplanar cracks in an inﬁnite plate. The lines of force representthe relative stress-concentrating effect of the cracks. As the ligament between the cracks shrinksin size, the area through which the force must be transmitted decreases. Consequently, K
I is
magniﬁed for each crack as the two cracks approach one another.
Figure 2.58 is a plot of the KI solution for the conﬁguration in Figure 2.57. As one might
expect, the crack tip closest to the neighboring crack experiences the greater magniﬁcation inK
I. The KI solution at tip B increases asymptotically as s → 0. At tip A, the solution approaches
as s → 0 because the two cracks become a single crack with twice the original length of each
crack.
Figure 2.57 and Figure 2.58 illustrate the general principle that multiple cracks in the same
plane have the effect of magnifying KI in one another.
2.12.2 P ARALLEL  CRACKS
Figure 2.59 illustrates two parallel cracks. In this case, the cracks tend to shield one another,which results in a decrease in K
I relative to the single crack case. Figure 2.60 shows the KI
solution for this geometry. This is indicative of the general case where two or more parallelcracks have a mutual shielding interaction when subject to Mode I loading. Consequently,multiple cracks that are parallel to one another are of less concern than multiple cracks in thesame plane.

The equations that follow are simpliﬁcations of more general relationships in elasticity and are
subject to the following restrictions:
• Two-dimensional stress state (plane stress or plane strain)
• Isotropic material• Quasistatic, isothermal deformation
• Absence of body forces from the problem (In problems where body forces are present,
a solution can ﬁrst be obtained in the absence of body forces, and then modiﬁed bysuperimposing the body forces.)
Imposing these restrictions simpliﬁes crack problems considerably, and permits closed-form solu-tions in many cases.FIGURE 2.60 Interaction between two identical parallel through-wall cracks in an inﬁnite plate. Taken from

where ∆ is the local load line displacement and P is the applied load. Differentiating
Equation (A2.14) gives
(A2.15)
assuming ∆ depends only on load and crack length. We can make this same assumption about the

A2.3 C RACK-TIP STRESS ANALYSIS
A variety of techniques are available for analyzing stresses in cracked bodies. This section focuseson two early approaches developed by Williams [11, 37] and Westergaard [8]. These two analysesare complementary; the Williams approach considers the local crack-tip ﬁelds under generalized in-plane loading, while Westergaard provided a means for connecting the local ﬁelds to global boundaryconditions in certain conﬁgurations.
Space limitations preclude listing every minute step in each derivation. Moreover, stress, strain,
and displacement distributions are not derived for all modes of loading. The derivations that followserve as illustrative examples. The reader who is interested in further details should consult the originalreferences.
A2.3.1 Generalized In-Plane Loading
Williams was the ﬁrst to demonstrate the universal nature of the singularity for elastic crack
problems, although Inglis [1], Westergaard, and Sneddon [10] had earlier obtained this result inspeciﬁc conﬁgurations. Williams actually began by considering stresses at the corner of a platewith various boundary conditions and included angles; a crack is a special case where the includedangle of the plate corner is 2
π and the surfaces are traction free (Figure A2.1).dadaPdP C dPT

For the conﬁguration shown in Figure A2.1(b), Williams postulated the following stress function:
(A2.19)
where c1, c2, c3, and c4 are constants, and θ* is deﬁned in Figure A2.1(b). Invoking Equation (A2.13)
gives the following expressions for the stresses:
(A2.20a)
(A2.20b)
(A2.20c)
where the primes denote derivatives with respect to θ*. Williams also showed that Equation (A2.19)
implies that the displacements vary with rλ. In order for displacements to be ﬁnite in all regions of the
body, λ must be > 0. If the crack faces are traction free,
which implies the following boundary conditions:
(A2.21)
Assuming the constants in Equation (A2.19) are nonzero in the most general case, the boundary
conditions can be satisﬁed only when . Thus,
, where n = 1, 2, 3,…
There are an inﬁnite number of λ values that satisfy the boundary conditions; the most general
solution to a crack problem, therefore, is a polynomial of the form

and the stresses are given by
(A2.23)
where Γ is a function that depends on F and its derivatives. The order of the stress function
polynomial, M, must be sufﬁcient to model the stresses in all regions of the body. When ,
the ﬁrst term in Equation (A2.23) approaches inﬁnity, while the higher-order terms remain ﬁnite
(when m = 0) or approach zero (for m > 0). Thus the higher-order terms are negligible close to the
crack-tip, and stress exhibits a  singularity. Note that this result was obtained without assuminga speciﬁc conﬁguration. It can be concluded that the inverse square-root singularity is universalfor cracks in isotropic elastic media.
A further evaluation of Equation (A2.19) and Equation (A2.20) with the appropriate boundary
conditions reveals the precise nature of the function Γ. Recall that Equation (A2.19) contains four,
as yet unspeciﬁed, constants; by applying Equation (A2.21), it is possible to eliminate two of theseconstants, resulting in
(A2.24)
for a given value of n. For crack problems, it is more convenient to express the stress function
in terms of 
θ, the angle from the symmetry plane (Figure A2.1). Substituting θ = θ* − π into
Equation (A2.24) yields, after some algebra, the following stress function for the ﬁrst few valuesof n:
(A2.25)
where s
i and ti are constants to be deﬁned. The stresses are given by
(A2.26a)
(A2.26b)
(A2.26c)
Note that the constants si in the stress function (Equation (A2.25)) are multiplied by cosine
terms while the ti are multiplied by sine terms. Thus, the stress function contains symmetric
and antisymmetric components, with respect to θ = 0. When the loading is symmetric about
θ = 0, ti = 0, while si = 0 for the special case of pure antisymmetric loading. Examples of
symmetric loading include pure bending and pure tension; in both cases the principal stress isnormal to the crack plane. Therefore, symmetric loading corresponds to Mode I (Figure 2.14);antisymmetric loading is produced by in-plane shear on the crack faces and corresponds toMode II.σθ

It is convenient in most cases to treat the symmetric and antisymmetric stresses separately. The
constants s1 and t1 can be replaced by the Mode I and Mode II stress intensity factors, respectively:

The singular stress ﬁelds for Mode II are given by
(A2.29a)

strain components at points near the crack tip increase in proportion to K, provided the crack is
stationary. The precise deﬁnition of the stress intensity factor is arbitrary, however; the constants s
1
and t1 would serve equally well for characterizing the singularity. The accepted deﬁnition of stress
intensity stems from the early work of Irwin [9], who quantiﬁed the amplitude of the Mode I singularitywith , where G is the energy release rate. It turns out that the  in the denominators of
Equation (A2.28) and Equation (A2.29) is superﬂuous (see Equation (A2.34)– (A2.36), but conventionestablished over the last 35 years precludes redeﬁning K in a more straightforward form.
Williams also derived relationships for radial and tangential displacements near the crack tip.
We will postpone the evaluation of displacements until the next section, however, because theWestergaard approach for deriving displacements is somewhat more compact.
A2.3.2 The Westergaard Stress Function
Westergaard showed that a limited class of problems could be solved by introducing a complex
stress function Z(z), where z = x + iy and . The Westergaard stress function is related tosKI

the Airy stress function as follows:
(A2.30)
where Re and Im denote real and imaginary parts of the function, respectively, and the bars over
Z represent integrations with respect to z, i.e.,
and
Applying Equation (A2.6) gives
(A2.31a)
(A2.31b)
(A2.31c)
Note that the imaginary part of the stresses vanishes when y = 0. In addition, the shear stress
vanishes when y = 0, implying that the crack plane is a principal plane. Thus, the stresses are
symmetric about θ = 0 and Equation (A2.31) implies Mode I loading.
The Westergaard stress function, in its original form, is suitable for solving a limited range of
Mode I crack problems. Subsequent modiﬁcations [38–41] generalized the Westergaard approachto be applicable to a wider range of cracked conﬁgurations.
Consider a through crack in an inﬁnite plate subject to biaxial remote tension (Figure A2.2).
If the origin is deﬁned at the center of the crack, the Westergaard stress function is given by
(A2.32)
where 
σ is the remote stress and a is the half-crack length, as deﬁned in Figure A2.2. Consider the
crack plane where y = 0. For −a < x < a , Z is pure imaginary, while Z is real for |x| > |a| . The
normal stresses on the crack plane are given by
(A2.33)
Let us now consider the horizontal distance from each crack tip, x* = x − a, Equation (A2.33)
becomes
(A2.34)
for x* << a. Thus, the Westergaard approach leads to the expected inverse square-root singularity.
One advantage of this analysis is that it relates the local stresses to the global stress and crack size.From Equation (A2.28), the stresses on the crack plane (
θ = 0) are given by

assuming  r >> a . Equation (A2.38) is equivalent to Equation (A2.28), except that the latter is
expressed in terms of polar coordinates.
Westergaard published the following stress function for an array of collinear cracks in a plate
in biaxial tension (Figure 2.21):
(A2.39)
where a is the half-crack length and 2 W is the spacing between the crack centers. The stress intensity
for this case is given in Equation (2.45); early investigators used this solution to approximate the
behavior of a center-cracked tensile panel with ﬁnite width.
Irwin [9] published stress functions for several additional conﬁgurations, including a pair of
crack-opening forces located at a distance X from the crack center (Figure 2.32):
(A2.40)
where P is the applied force. When there are matching forces at , the appropriate stress function
can be obtained by superposition:
(A2.41)
In each case, the stress function can be expressed in the form of Equation (A2.37) and the near-tip stresses are given by Equation (A2.38). This is not surprising, since all of the above cases arepure Mode I and the Williams analysis showed that the inverse square root singularity is universal.
For plane strain conditions, the in-plane displacements are related to the Westergaard stress
function as follows:

Although the original Westergaard approach correctly describes the singular Mode I stresses in
certain conﬁgurations, it is not sufﬁciently general to apply to all Mode I problems; this shortcominghas prompted various modiﬁcations to the Westergaard stress function. Irwin [38] noted thatphotoelastic fringe patterns observed by Wells and Post [42] on center-cracked panels did not matchthe shear strain contours predicted by the Westergaard solution. Irwin achieved a good agreementbetween theory and experiment by subtracting a uniform horizontal stress:
(A2.46)
where 
σoxx depends on the remote stress. The other two stress components remain the same as in
Equation (A2.31). Subsequent analyses have revealed that when a center-cracked panel is loaded inuniaxial tension, a transverse compressive stress develops in the plate. Thus, Irwin’s modiﬁcation tothe Westergaard solution has a physical basis in the case of a center-cracked panel.
5 Equation (A2.46)
has been used to interpret photoelastic fringe patterns in a variety of conﬁgurations.
Sih [39] provided a theoretical basis for the Irwin modiﬁcation. A stress function for Mode I
must lead to zero shear stress on the crack plane. Sih showed that the Westergaard function wasmore restrictive than it needed to be, and was thus unable to account for all situations. Sihgeneralized the Westergaard approach by applying a complex potential formulation for the Airystress function [39]. He imposed the condition 
τxy = 0 at y = 0, and showed that the stresses could
be expressed in terms of a new function φ(z):
(A2.47a)
(A2.47b)
(A2.47c)
5Recall that the stress function in Equation (A2.32) is strictly valid only for biaxial loading. Although this restriction was
not imposed in Westergaard’s original work, a transverse tensile stress is necessary in order to cancel with −σoxx. However,
the transverse stresses, whether compressive or tensile, do not affect the singular term; thus the stress intensity factor is t he
same for uniaxial and biaxial tensile loading and is given by Equation (A2.36).24 22uEaxy=−σ

where A is a real constant. Equation (A2.47) is equivalent to the Irwin modiﬁcation of the
Westergaard approach if
(A2.48)
Substituting Equation (A2.48) into Equation (A2.47) gives
(A2.49a)
(A2.49b)
(A2.49c)
Comparing Equation (A2.49) with Equation (A2.31) and Equation (A2.46), it is obvious that the
Sih and Irwin modiﬁcations are equivalent, and 2 A = σoxx.
Sanford [41] showed that the Irwin-Sih approach is still too restrictive, and he proposed
replacing A with a complex function η(z):
(A2.50)
The modiﬁed stresses are given by
(A2.51a)
(A2.51b)
(A2.51c)
Equation (A2.51) represents the most general form of Westergaard-type stress functions. When
η(z) = a real constant for all z, Equation (A2.51) reduces to the Irwin-Sih approach, while Equation
(A2.51) reduces to the original Westergaard solution when η(z) = 0 for all z.
The function η can be represented as a polynomial of the form
(A2.52)
Combining Equation (A2.37), Equation (A2.50), and Equation (A2.52) and deﬁning the origin atthe crack tip gives
(A2.53)
which is consistent with the Williams [11, 38] asymptotic expansion.

Elastic-Plastic Fracture 
Mechanics 
Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is valid only as long as nonlinear material deformation
is conﬁned to a small region surrounding the crack tip. In many materials, it is virtually impossibleto characterize the fracture behavior with LEFM, and an alternative fracture mechanics model isrequired. 
Elastic-plastic fracture mechanics 
 applies to materials that exhibit time-independent, nonlinear
behavior (i.e., plastic deformation). Two elastic-plastic parameters are introduced in this chapter:the crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) and the 
 J  
contour integral. Both parameters describe
crack-tip conditions in elastic-plastic materials, and each can be used as a fracture criterion. Criticalvalues of CTOD 
  
or 
 J  
give nearly size-independent measures of fracture toughness, even for relatively
large amounts of crack-tip plasticity. There are limits to the applicability of 
 J  
and CTOD 
  
(Section 3.5
and Section 3.6), but these limits are much less restrictive than the validity requirements ofLEFM. 
3.1 CRACK-TIP-OPENING DISPLACEMENT 
When Wells [1] attempted to measure  
K 
Ic 
values in a number of structural steels, he found that
these materials were too tough to be characterized by LEFM. This discovery brought both goodnews and bad news: High toughness is obviously desirable to designers and fabricators, but Wells’experiments indicated that the existing fracture mechanics theory was not applicable to an importantclass of materials. While examining fractured test specimens, Wells noticed that the crack faceshad moved apart prior to fracture; plastic deformation had blunted an initially sharp crack, asillustrated in Figure 3.1. The degree of crack blunting increased in proportion to the toughness ofthe material. This observation led Wells to propose the opening at the crack tip as a measure offracture toughness. Today, this parameter is known as CTOD.
In his original paper, Wells [1] performed an approximate analysis that related CTOD 
  
to the
stress intensity factor in the limit of small-scale yielding. Consider a crack with a small plasticzone, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Irwin [2] postulated that crack-tip plasticity makes the crackbehave as if it were slightly longer (Section 2.8.1). Thus, we can estimate the CTOD 
  
by solving
for the displacement at the physical crack tip, assuming an effective crack length of  
a  
+  
r 
y 
. From
Table 2.2, the displacement  
r 
y 
 behind the effective crack tip is given by
(3.1)
where  
E 
′ 
 is the effective Young’s modulus, as deﬁned in Section 2.7. The Irwin plastic zone correction
for plane stress is

Substituting Equation (3.2) into Equation (3.1) gives
(3.3)
where  
δ 
 is the CTOD. Alternatively, CTOD 
  
can be related to the energy release rate by applying
Equation (2.54):

is related to

. Wells postulated that CTOD
is an appropriate crack-tip-characterizing parameter when LEFM is no longer valid. This assumption
was shown to be correct several years later when a unique relationship between CTOD 
  
and the 
 J 
integral was established (Section 3.3).
The strip-yield model provides an alternate means for analyzing CTOD 
  
[3]. Recall Section
2.8.2, where the plastic zone was modeled by yield magnitude closure stresses. The size of thestrip-yield zone was deﬁned by the requirement of ﬁnite stresses at the crack tip. The CTOD 
  
can
be deﬁned as the crack-opening displacement at the end of the strip-yield zone, as Figure 3.3illustrates. According to this deﬁnition, CTOD 
  
in a through crack in an inﬁnite plate subject to a
remote tensile stress (Figure 2.3) is given by [3]

Equation (3.5) is derived in Appendix 3.1. Series expansion of the “ln sec” term gives
(3.6)
Therefore, as 
(3.7)
which differs slightly from Equation (3.3).
The strip-yield model assumes plane stress conditions and a nonhardening material. The actual
relationship between CTOD 
  
and 
 K 
I 
 and  
G 
 depends on stress state and strain hardening. The more
general form of this relationship can be expressed as follows:
(3.8)
where  
m 
 is a dimensionless constant that is approximately 1.0 for plane stress and 2.0 for plane
strain.
There are a number of alternative deﬁnitions of CTOD. The two most common deﬁnitions,
which are illustrated in Figure 3.4, are the displacement at the original crack tip and the 90 
° 
intercept. The latter deﬁnition was suggested by Rice [4] and is commonly used to infer CTOD 
  
in
ﬁnite element measurements. Note that these two deﬁnitions are equivalent if the crack blunts in
a semicircle.
Most laboratory measurements of CTOD 
  
have been made on edge-cracked specimens loaded in
three-point bending (see Table 2.4). Early experiments used a ﬂat paddle-shaped gage that was insertedinto the crack; as the crack opened, the paddle gage rotated, and an electronic signal was sent to an 
x 
- 
y 
 plotter. This method was inaccurate, however, because it was difﬁcult to reach the crack tip with
the paddle gage. Today, the displacement  
V 
 at the crack mouth is measured, and the CTOD 
  
is inferred
by assuming the specimen halves are rigid and rotate about a hinge point, as illustrated in Figure 3.5.Referring to this ﬁgure, we can estimate CTOD 
  
from a similar triangles construction:

 is the rotational factor, a dimensionless constant between 0 and 1.
The hinge model is inaccurate when displacements are primarily elastic. Consequently, standard
methods for CTOD 
  
testing [5, 6] typically adopt a modiﬁed hinge model, in which displacements are
separated into elastic and plastic components; the hinge assumption is applied only to plastic dis-
placements. Figure 3.6 illustrates a typical load (

) vs. displacement ( 
V 
) curve from a CTOD 
  
test.
The shape of the load-displacement curve is similar to a stress-strain curve: It is initially linear butdeviates from linearity with plastic deformation. At a given point on the curve, the displacement isseparated into elastic and plastic components by constructing a line parallel to the elastic loading line.

3.2THE  
J 
 CONTOUR INTEGRAL 
The 
 J  
contour integral has enjoyed great success as a fracture characterizing parameter for nonlinear
materials. By idealizing elastic-plastic deformation as nonlinear elastic, Rice [4] provided the basisfor extending fracture mechanics methodology well beyond the validity limits of LEFM.
Figure 3.7 illustrates the uniaxial stress-strain behavior of elastic-plastic and nonlinear elastic
materials. The loading behavior for the two materials is identical, but the material responses differwhen each is unloaded. The elastic-plastic material follows a linear unloading path with the slopeequal to Young’s modulus, while the nonlinear elastic material unloads along the same path as itwas loaded. There is a unique relationship between stress and strain in an elastic material, but agiven strain in an elastic-plastic material can correspond to more than one stress value if the materialis unloaded or cyclically loaded. Consequently, it is much easier to analyze an elastic material thana material that exhibits irreversible plasticity.
As long as the stresses in both materials in Figure 3.7 increase monotonically, the mechanical
response of the two materials is identical. When the problem is generalized to three dimensions,it does not necessarily follow that the loading behavior of the nonlinear elastic and elastic-plasticmaterials is identical, but there are many instances where this is a good assumption (see Appendix3.6). Thus an analysis that assumes nonlinear elastic behavior may be valid for an elastic-plasticmaterial, provided no unloading occurs. The  
deformation theory of plasticity 
, which relates total
strains to stresses in a material, is equivalent to nonlinear elasticity.

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Rice [4] applied deformation plasticity (i.e., nonlinear elasticity) to the analysis of a crack in
a nonlinear material. He showed that the nonlinear energy release rate 
 J  
could be written as a path-
independent line integral. Hutchinson [7] and Rice and Rosengren [8] also showed that 
 J  
uniquely
characterizes crack-tip stresses and strains in nonlinear materials. Thus the 
 J  
integral can be viewed
as both an energy parameter and a stress intensity parameter.

Rice [4] presented a path-independent contour integral for the analysis of cracks. He then showed
that the value of this integral, which he called 
 J 
, 
  
is equal to the energy release rate in a nonlinear
elastic body that contains a crack. In this section, however, the energy release rate interpretationis discussed ﬁrst because it is closely related to concepts introduced in Chapter 2. The 
 J  
contour
integral is outlined in Section 3.2.2. Appendix 3.2 gives a mathematical proof, similar to what Rice[4] presented, that shows that this line integral is equivalent to the energy release rate in nonlinearelastic materials.
Equation (2.23) deﬁnes the energy release rate for linear materials. The same deﬁnition holds
for nonlinear elastic materials, except that  
G 
 is replaced by  
J 
:

Π

recognize this can lead to errors and confusion when computing G or J for conﬁgurations other than edge cracks; examples
include a through crack, where dA = 2da (assuming unit thickness), and a penny-shaped crack, where dA=2p ada.

Thus if the plate in Figure 3.8 is in load control,  J is given by

If the crack advances at a ﬁxed displacement, F = 0, and J is given by

According to Figure 3.8, dU* for load control differs from −dU for displacement control by the
amount dPd∆, which is vanishingly small compared to dU. Therefore,  J for load control is equal
to J for displacement control. Recall that we obtained this same result for G in Section 2.4.
By invoking the deﬁnitions for U and U*, we can express  J in terms of load and displacement:

110 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Integrating Equation (3.17) by parts leads to a rigorous proof of what we have already inferred
from Figure 3.8. That is, Equation (3.16) and Equation (3.17) are equal, and  J is the same for ﬁxed
load and ﬁxed grip conditions.
Thus, J is a more general version of the energy release rate. For the special case of a linear
elastic material,  J = G. Also
(3.18)
for linear elastic Mode I loading. For mixed mode loading refer to Equation (2.63).
A word of caution is necessary when applying  J to elastic-plastic materials. The energy release
rate is normally deﬁned as the potential energy that is released  from a structure when the crack
grows in an elastic material. However, much of the strain energy absorbed by an elastic-plasticmaterial is not recovered when the crack grows or the specimen is unloaded; a growing crack inan elastic-plastic material leaves a plastic wake (Figure 2.6(b)). Thus the energy release rate concepthas a somewhat different interpretation for elastic-plastic materials. Rather than deﬁning the energyreleased from the body when the crack grows, Equation (3.15) relates  J to the difference in energy
absorbed by specimens with neighboring crack sizes. This distinction is important only when thecrack grows (Section 3.4.2). See Appendix 4.2 and Chapter 12 for a further discussion of the energyrelease rate concept.
The energy release rate deﬁnition of  J is useful for elastic-plastic materials when applied in an
appropriate manner. For example, Section 3.2.5 describes how Equations (3.15)–(3.17) can beexploited to measure  J experimentally.
3.2.2J AS A PATH-INDEPENDENT  LINE INTEGRAL
Consider an arbitrary counterclockwise path ( Γ) around the tip of a crack, as in Figure 3.9. The  J
integral is given by
(3.19)
where 
w = strain energy density
Ti = components of the traction vector
ui = displacement vector components
ds = length increment along the contour Γ
The strain energy density is deﬁned as

where sij and eij are the stress and strain tensors, respectively. The traction is a stress vector at a
given point on the contour. That is, if we were to construct a free body diagram of the material
inside of the contour, Ti would deﬁne the stresses acting at the boundaries. The components of the
traction vector are given by
(3.21)
where nj are the components of the unit vector normal to Γ.
Rice [4] showed that the value of the  J integral is independent of the path of integration around
the crack. Thus  J is called a path-independent  integral. Appendix 3.2 demonstrates this path inde-
pendence, and shows that Equation (3.19) is equal to the energy release rate.
3.2.3J AS A STRESS INTENSITY  PARAMETER
Hutchinson [7] and Rice and Rosengren [8] independently showed that  J characterizes crack-tip
conditions in a nonlinear elastic material. They each assumed a power law relationship betweenplastic strain and stress. If elastic strains are included, this relationship for uniaxial deformation isgiven by
(3.22)
where
s
o = reference stress value that is usually equal to the yield strength
eo = so/E
a = dimensionless constant
n = strain-hardening exponent.2
Equation (3.22) is known as the Ramberg-Osgood equation, and is widely used for curve-ﬁttingstress-strain data. Hutchinson, Rice, and Rosengren showed that in order to remain path indepen-dent, stress–strain must vary as 1/ r near the crack tip. At distances very close to the crack tip, well
within the plastic zone, elastic strains are small in comparison to the total strain, and the stress-strain behavior reduces to a simple power law. These two conditions imply the following variationof stress and strain ahead of the crack tip:
(3.23a)
(3.23b)
where k
1 and k2 are proportionality constants, which are deﬁned more precisely below. For a linear
elastic material, n = 1, and Equation (3.23) predicts a  singularity, which is consistent with
LEFM theory.
2 Although Equation (3.22) contains four material constants, there are only two ﬁtting parameters. The choice of so,
which is arbitrary, deﬁnes eo; a linear regression is then performed on a log-log plot of stress vs. plastic strain to determine
a and n.Tnii j j=σ

112 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The actual stress and strain distributions are obtained by applying the appropriate boundary
conditions (see Appendix 3.4):
(3.24a)
and
(3.24b)
where In is an integration constant that depends on n, and  and are the dimensionless functions
of n and q . These parameters also depend on the assumed stress state (i.e., plane stress or plane
strain). Equation (3.24a) and Equation (3.24b) are called the HRR singularity, named after Hutchinson,
Rice, and Rosengren [7, 8]. Figure 3.10 is a plot of In vs. n  for plane stress and plane strain.
Figure 3.11 shows the angular variation of ( n, q) [7]. The stress components in Figure 3.11
are deﬁned in terms of polar coordinates rather than x and y .
The J integral deﬁnes the amplitude of the HRR singularity, just as the stress intensity factor
characterizes the amplitude of the linear elastic singularity. Thus  J completely describes the con-
ditions within the plastic zone. A structure in small-scale yielding has two singularity-dominatedzones: one in the elastic region, where stress varies as , and one in the plastic zone wherestress varies as . The latter often persists long after the linear elastic singularity zone hasbeen destroyed by crack-tip plasticity.

3.2.4 T HE LARGE STRAIN ZONE
The HRR singularity contains the same apparent anomaly as the LEFM singularity; namely, both
predict inﬁnite stresses as r → 0. However, the singular ﬁeld does not persist all the way to the
crack tip. The large strains at the crack tip cause the crack to blunt, which reduces the stresstriaxiality locally. The blunted crack tip is a free surface; thus s
xx must vanish at r = 0.
The analysis that leads to the HRR singularity does not consider the effect of the blunted crack
tip on the stress ﬁelds, nor does it take account of the large strains that are present near the crack tip.This analysis is based on the small strain theory, which is the multi-axial equivalent of engineeringstrain in a tensile test. Small strain theory breaks down when strains are greater than ~0.10 (10%).
McMeeking and Parks [9] performed crack-tip ﬁnite element analyses that incorporated large
strain theory and ﬁnite geometry changes. Some of their results are shown in Figure 3.12, whichis a plot of stress normal to the crack plane vs. distance. The HRR singularity (Equation (3.24a))is also shown on this plot. Note that both axes are nondimensionalized in such a way that bothcurves are invariant, as long as the plastic zone is small compared to the specimen dimensions.
The solid curve in Figure 3.12 reaches a peak when the ratio xs
o/J is approximately unity, and
decreases as x → 0. This distance corresponds approximately to twice the CTOD. The HRR singularity
is invalid within this region, where the stresses are inﬂuenced by large strains and crack blunting.
The breakdown of the HRR solution at the crack tip leads to a similar question to one that
was posed in Section 2.9: Is the  J integral a useful fracture criterion when a blunting zone forms(a)

114 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
at the crack tip? The answer is also similar to the argument offered in Section 2.9. That is, as
long as there is a region surrounding  the crack tip that can be described by Equation (3.24), the
J integral uniquely characterizes crack-tip conditions, and a critical value of  J is a size-
independent measure of fracture toughness. The question of  J controlled fracture is explored
further in Section 3.5.
3.2.5 L ABORATORY  MEASUREMENT  OF J
When the material behavior is linear elastic, the calculation of J in a test specimen or structure is
relatively straightforward because  J = G, and G is uniquely related to the stress intensity factor.
The latter quantity can be computed from the load and crack size, assuming a  K solution for that
particular geometry is available.
Computing the  J integral is somewhat more difﬁcult when the material is nonlinear. The
principle of superposition no longer applies, and  J is not proportional to the applied load. Thus a
simple relationship between  J, load, and crack length is usually not available.
One option for determining  J is to apply the line integral deﬁnition Equation (3.19) to the
conﬁguration of interest. Read [10] has measured the  J integral in test panels by attaching an array
of strain gages in a contour around the crack tip. Since  J is path independent and the choice of
contour is arbitrary, he selected a contour in such a way as to simplify the calculation of  J as much
as possible. This method can also be applied to ﬁnite element analysis, i.e., stresses, strains, anddisplacements can be determined along a contour and  J can then be calculated according to
Equation (3.19). However, the contour method for determining  J is impractical in most cases. The
instrumentation required for experimental measurements of the contour integral is highly cumber-some, and the contour method is also not very attractive in numerical analysis (see Chapter 12).FIGURE 3.12 Large-strain crack-tip ﬁnite element results of McMeeking and Parks. Blunting causes the
stresses to deviate from the HRR solution close to the crack tip. Taken from McMeeking, R.M. and Parks,

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 115
A much better method for determining  J numerically is outlined in Chapter 12. More practical
experimental approaches are developed below and are explored further in Chapter 7.
Landes and Begley [11, 12], who were among the ﬁrst to measure  J experimentally, invoked
the energy release rate deﬁnition of  J (Equation (3.11)). Figure 3.13 schematically illustrates their
approach. They obtained a series of test specimens of the same size, geometry, and material and
introduced cracks of various lengths.3 They deformed each specimen and plotted load vs. displace-
ment (Figure 3.13(a)). The area under a given curve is equal to U, the energy absorbed by the
specimen. Landes and Begley plotted U vs. crack length at various ﬁxed displacements
(Fig. 3.13(b)). For an edge-cracked specimen of thickness B, the J integral is given by
(3.25)
Thus J can be computed by determining the slope of the tangent to the curves in Figure 3.13(b).
Applying Equation (3.25) leads to Figure 3.13(c), a plot of  J vs. displacement at various crackFIGURE 3.13 Schematic of early experimental measurements of J, performed by Landes and Begley. Taken

lengths. The latter is a calibration curve, which only applies to the material, specimen size, specimen
geometry, and temperature for which it was obtained. The Landes and Begley approach has obviousdisadvantages, since multiple specimens must be tested and analyzed to determine  J in a particular
set of circumstances.
Rice et al. [13] showed that it was possible, in certain cases, to determine  J directly from the
load displacement curve of a single specimen. Their derivations of  J relationships for several
specimen conﬁgurations demonstrate the usefulness of dimensional analysis.

Consider a double-edge-notched tension panel of unit thickness (Figure 3.14). Cracks of length a
on opposite sides of the panel are separated by a ligament of length  2b. For this conﬁguration, dA =
2da = −2db (see Footnote 1); Equation (3.16) must be modiﬁed accordingly:
(3.26)
In order to compute  J from the above expression, it is necessary to determine the relationship between
load, displacement, and panel dimensions. Assuming an isotropic material that obeys a Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain law (Equation (3.22)), the dimensional analysis gives the following functionalrelationship for displacement:
(3.27)
where Φ is a dimensionless function. For ﬁxed material properties, we need only consider the load
and specimen dimensions. For reasons described below, we can simplify the functional relationshipfor displacement by separating ∆ into elastic and plastic components:

Substituting Equation (3.28) into Equation (3.26) leads to a relationship for the elastic and plastic
components of J:
(3.29)
where E′ = E for plane stress and E′ = E/(1 − n 2) for plane strain, as deﬁned in Chapter 2. Thus
we need only be concerned about plastic displacements because a solution for the elastic componentof J is already available (Table 2.4). If plastic deformation is conﬁned to the ligament between the
crack tips (Figure 3.14(b)), we can assume that b is the only length dimension that inﬂuences ∆
p.
That is a reasonable assumption, provided the panel is deeply notched so that the average stress inthe ligament is substantially higher than the remote stress in the gross cross section. We can deﬁnea new function for ∆
p:
(3.30)
Note that the net-section yielding assumption has eliminated the dependence on the a/b ratio.
Taking a partial derivative with respect to the ligament length gives
where H′ denotes the ﬁrst derivative of the function H. We can solve for H′ by taking a partial
derivative of Equation (3.30) with respect to load:
Therefore
(3.31)
Substituting Equation (3.31) into Equation (3.29) and integrating by parts gives

Recall that we assumed a unit thickness at the beginning of this derivation. In general, the plastic
term must be divided by the plate thickness; the term in square brackets, which depends on theload displacement curve, is normalized by the net cross-sectional area of the panel. The  J integral
has units of energy/area.
Another example from the Rice et al. article [13] is an edge-cracked plate in bending
(Figure 3.15). In this case they chose to separate displacements along somewhat different linesfrom the previous problem. If the plate is subject to a bending moment M, it would displace by
an angle Ω
nc if no crack were present, and an additional amount Ωc when the plate is cracked.JbbdP

Thus the total angular displacement can be written as
(3.33)
If the crack is deep, Ωc >> Ωnc. The energy absorbed by the plate is given by
(3.34)
When we differentiate U with respect to the crack area in order to determine  J, only Ωc contributes
to the energy release rate because Ωnc is not a function of crack size, by deﬁnition. By analogy
with Equation (3.16),  J for the cracked plate in bending can be written as
(3.35)
If the material properties are ﬁxed, dimensional analysis leads to
(3.36)
assuming the ligament length is the only relevant length dimension, which is reasonable if the crack
is deep. When Equation (3.36) is differentiated with respect to b and inserted into Equation (3.35),
the resulting expression for  J is as follows:
(3.37)
The decision to separate Ω into ‘‘crack’’ and ‘‘no-crack’’ components was somewhat arbitrary.
The angular displacement could have been divided into elastic and plastic components as in theprevious example. If the crack is relatively deep, Ω
nc should be entirely elastic, while Ωc may
contain both elastic and plastic contributions. Therefore, Equation (3.37) can be written asFIGURE 3.15 Edge-cracked plate in pure bending.

or
(3.38)
Conversely, the prior analysis on the double-edged cracked plate in tension could have been written
in terms of ∆c and ∆nc. Recall, however, that the dimensional analysis was simpliﬁed in each case
(Equation (3.30) and Equation (3.36)) by assuming a negligible dependence on a/b. This turns out to
be a reasonable assumption for plastic displacements in deeply notched DENT panels, but less so forelastic displacements. Thus while elastic and plastic displacements due to the crack can be combinedto compute  J in bending (Equation (3.37)), it is not advisable to do so for tensile loading. The relative
accuracy and the limitations of Equation (3.32) and Equation (3.37) are evaluated in Chapter 9.
In general, the  J integral for a variety of conﬁgurations can be written in the following form:
(3.39)
where  h is a dimensionless constant. Note that Equation (3.39) contains the actual thickness, while the
above derivations assumed a unit thickness for convenience. Equation (3.39) expresses  J as the energy
absorbed, divided by the cross-sectional area, times a dimensionless constant. For a deeply crackedplate in pure bending,  h = 2. Equation (3.39) can be separated into elastic and plastic components:

3.3 RELA TIONSHIPS BETWEEN J AND CTOD
For linear elastic conditions, the relationship between CTOD and G is given by Equation (3.8).
Since  J = G for linear elastic material behavior, these equations also describe the relationship
between CTOD  and J in the limit of small-scale yielding. That is
(3.41)
where  m is a dimensionless constant that depends on the stress state and material properties. It can
be shown that Equation (3.41) applies well beyond the validity limits of LEFM.
Consider, for example, a strip-yield zone ahead of a crack tip, as illustrated in Figure 3.16.
Recall (from Chapter 2) that the strip-yield zone is modeled by surface tractions along the crack
face. Let us deﬁne a contour Γ along the boundary of this zone. If the damage zone is long and
slender, i.e., if r >> d, the ﬁrst term in the  J contour integral (Equation 3.19) vanishes because
dy = 0. Since the only surface tractions within r are in the y direction, ny = 1 and nx = nz = 0. Thus
the J integral is given by
(3.42)
Let us deﬁne a new coordinate system with the origin at the tip of the strip-yield zone: X = r − x.
For a ﬁxed d, syy and uy depend only on X, provided r is small compared to the in-plane dimensions
of the cracked body. The  J integral becomes

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 121
where d = 2uy (X = r). Since the strip-yield model assumes syy = sYS within the plastic zone, the
J-CTOD relationship is given by
(3.44)
Note the similarity between Equation (3.44) and Equation (3.7). The latter was derived from the
strip-yield model by neglecting the higher-order terms in a series expansion; no such assumptionwas necessary to derive Equation (3.44). Thus the strip-yield model, which assumes plane stressconditions and a nonhardening material, predicts that  m = 1 for both linear elastic and elastic-
plastic conditions.
Shih [14] provided further evidence that a unique J-CTOD relationship applies well beyond
the validity limits of LEFM. He evaluated the displacements at the crack tip implied by the HRRsolution and related the displacement at the crack tip to  J and ﬂow properties. According to the
HRR solution, the displacements near the crack tip are as follows:
(3.45)
where  is a dimensionless function of q and n, analogous to  and  (Equation (3.24)). Shih
[14] invoked the 90 ° intercept deﬁnition of CTOD, as illustrated in Figure 3.4(b). This 90 ° intercept
construction is examined further in Figure 3.17. The CTOD  is obtained by evaluating u
x and uy at
r = r* and q  = p:
(3.46)
Substituting Equation (3.46) into Equation (3.45) and solving for r* gives
(3.47)
Setting d = 2uy(r*, π) leads to

Equation (3.48) indicates that dn = 1/m, assuming so = sYS (see Footnote 2). According to Figure
3.18(a), dn = 1.0 for a nonhardening material ( n = ∞) in plane stress, which agrees with the strip-
yield model (Equation (3.44)).
The Shih analysis shows that there is a unique relationship between  J and CTOD  for a given
material. Thus these two quantities are equally valid crack-tip-characterizing parameters for elastic-
plastic materials. The fracture toughness of a material can be quantiﬁed either by a critical valueof J or CTOD.
The above analysis contains an apparent inconsistency. Equation (3.48) is based on the HRR
singularity, which does not account for large geometry changes at the crack tip. Figure 3.12 indicatesthat the stresses predicted by the HRR theory are inaccurate for r < 2d, but the Shih analysis uses
the HRR solution to evaluate displacements well within the large strain region. Crack-tip ﬁniteelement analyses [14], however, are in general agreement with Equation (3.48). Thus the displace-ment ﬁelds predicted from the HRR theory are reasonably accurate, despite the large plastic strainsat the crack tip.
3.4 CRACK-GRO WTH RESIST ANCE CURVES
Many materials with high toughness do not fail catastrophically at a particular value of  J or CTOD.
Rather, these materials display a rising R curve, where  J and CTOD increase with crack growth.
In metals, a rising R curve is normally associated with the growth and coalescence of microvoids.
See Chapter 5 for a discussion of microscopic fracture mechanisms in ductile metals.
Figure 3.19 schematically illustrates a typical  J resistance curve for a ductile material. In the
initial stages of deformation, the R curve is nearly vertical; there is a small amount of apparent
crack growth due to blunting. As  J increases, the material at the crack tip fails locally and the crack
advances further. Because the R curve is rising, the initial crack growth is usually stable, but an
instability can be encountered later, as discussed below.
One measure of fracture toughness JIc is deﬁned near the initiation of stable crack growth. The
precise point at which crack growth begins is usually ill-deﬁned. Consequently, the deﬁnition ofJ
Ic is somewhat arbitrary, much like a 0.2% offset yield strength. The corresponding CTOD  near
the initiation of stable crack growth is denoted di by U.S. and British testing standards. Chapter 7
describes experimental measurements of JIc and di in more detail.

124 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
While initiation toughness provides some information about the fracture behavior of a ductile
material, the entire R curve gives a more complete description. The slope of the R curve at a given
amount of crack extension is indicative of the relative stability of the crack growth; a material with
a steep R curve is less likely to experience unstable crack propagation. For J resistance curves, the
slope is usually quantiﬁed by a dimensionless tearing modulus:
(3.49)
where the subscript R indicates a value of  J on the resistance curve. 
3.4.1 S TABLE AND UNSTABLE  CRACK GROWTH
The conditions that govern the stability of crack growth in elastic-plastic materials are virtuallyidentical to the elastic case presented in Section 2.5. Instability occurs when the driving force curveis tangent to the R curve. As Figure 3.20 indicates, load control is usually less stable than displacement
control. The conditions in most structures are somewhere between the extremes of load control anddisplacement control. The intermediate case can be represented by a spring in series with thestructure, where remote displacement is ﬁxed (Figure 2.12). Since the R curve slope has been
represented by a dimensionless tearing modulus (Equation (3.49)), it is convenient to express thedriving force in terms of an applied tearing modulus :
(3.50)
where ∆
T is the total remote displacement deﬁned as
(3.51)
and Cm is the system compliance. The slope of the driving force curve for a ﬁxed ∆T is identical
to the linear elastic case (Equation (2.35)), except that G is replaced by J:

For load control, Cm = ∞, and the second term in Equation (3.52) vanishes:
For displacement control, Cm = 0, and ∆T = ∆. Equation (3.52) is derived in Appendix 2.2 for the
linear elastic case.

Therefore, the relevant partial derivatives are given by
Substituting the above relationships into Equation (3.50) and Equation (3.52) gives
As discussed in Section 2.5, the point of instability in a material with a rising R curve depends
on the size and geometry of the cracked structure; a critical value of  J at instability is not a material
property if  J increases with crack growth. It is usually assumed that the R curve, including the JIc
value, is a material property, independent of the conﬁguration. This is a reasonable assumption,
within certain limitations.
3.4.2 C OMPUTING  J FOR A GROWING  CRACK
The geometry dependence of a  J resistance curve is inﬂuenced by the way in which  J is calculated.
The equations derived in Section 3.2.5 are based on the pseudo energy release rate deﬁnition of  J
and are valid only for a stationary crack. There are various ways to compute  J for a growing crack,
including the deformation J and the far-ﬁeld J, which are described below. The former method is
typically used to obtain experimental J resistance curves.
Figure 3.22 illustrates the load-displacement behavior in a specimen with a growing crack.
Recall that the  J integral is based on a deformation plasticity (or nonlinear elastic) assumption for
material behavior. Consider point A on the load-displacement curve in Figure 3.22. The crack has
grown to a length  a1 from an initial length ao. The cross-hatched area represents the energy that
would be released if the material were elastic. In an elastic-plastic material, only the elastic portionof this energy is released; the remainder is dissipated in a plastic wake that forms behind thegrowing crack (see Figure 2.6(b) and Figure 3.25).
In an elastic material, all quantities, including strain energy, are independent of the loading
history. The energy absorbed during crack growth in an elastic-plastic material, however, exhibitsa history dependence. The dashed curve in Figure 3.22 represents the load-displacement behaviorwhen the crack size is ﬁxed at a
1. The area under this curve is the strain energy in an elastic
material; this energy depends only on the current load and crack length:

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 127
where the subscript D refers to the deformation theory. Thus the  J integral for a nonlinear elastic
body with a growing crack is given by
(3.56a)
or
(3.56b)
where b is the current  ligament length. When the  J integral for an elastic-plastic material is deﬁned
by Equation (3.56), the history dependence is removed and the energy release rate interpretation
of J is restored. The deformation J  is usually computed from Equation (3.56b) because no correction
is required on the elastic term as long as KI is determined from the current load and crack length.
The calculation of  UD(p) is usually performed incrementally, since the deformation theory load-
displacement curve (Figure 3.22 and Equation (3.55)) depends on the crack size. Speciﬁc proceduresfor computing the deformation  J are outlined in Chapter 7.
One can determine a far-ﬁeld  J from the contour integral deﬁnition of Equation (3.19), which
may differ from J
D. For a deeply cracked bend specimen, Rice et al. [15] showed that the far-ﬁeld
J contour integral in a rigid, perfectly plastic material is given by

where the variation in b during the loading history is taken into account. The deformation theory
leads to the following relationship for  J in this specimen:
(3.58)
The two expressions are obviously identical when the crack is stationary.
Finite element calculations of Dodds et al. [16, 17] for a three-point bend specimen made from
a strain hardening material indicate that Jf and JD are approximately equal for moderate amounts
of crack growth. The J integral obtained from a contour integration is path-dependent when a crack
is growing in an elastic-plastic material, however, and tends to zero as the contour shrinks to the
crack tip. See Appendix 4.2 for a theoretical explanation of the path dependence of J for a growing
crack in an inelastic material.
There is no guarantee that either the deformation JD or Jf will uniquely characterize crack-tip conditions
for a growing crack. Without this single-parameter characterization, the J-R curve becomes geometry
dependent. The issue of  J validity and geometry dependence is explored in detail in Section 3.5 and
Section 3.6.
3.5J-CONTROLLED FRACTURE
The term J-controlled fracture  corresponds to situations where  J completely characterizes crack-tip
conditions. In such cases, there is a unique relationship between  J and CTOD (Section 3.3); thus
J-controlled fracture implies CTOD-controlled fracture, and vice versa. Just as there are limits to
LEFM, fracture mechanics analyses based on  J and CTOD  become suspect when there is excessive
plasticity or signiﬁcant crack growth. In such cases, fracture toughness and the J-CTOD relationship
depend on the size and geometry of the structure or test specimen.
The required conditions for J-controlled fracture are discussed below. Fracture initiation from
a stationary crack and stable crack growth are considered.
3.5.1 S TATIONARY  CRACKS
Figure 3.23 schematically illustrates the effect of plasticity on the crack tip stresses; log ( syy) is
plotted against the normalized distance from the crack tip. The characteristic length scale L
corresponds to the size of the structure; for example, L could represent the uncracked ligament
length. Figure 3.23(a) shows the small-scale yielding case, where both  K and J characterize crack-
tip conditions. At a short distance from the crack tip, relative to L, the stress is proportional to
; this area is called the K-dominated region . Assuming monotonic, quasistatic loading, a
J-dominated region occurs in the plastic zone, where the elastic singularity no longer applies. Well
inside of the plastic zone, the HRR solution is approximately valid and the stresses vary as .The ﬁnite strain region occurs within approximately 2 d from the crack tip, where large deformation
invalidates the HRR theory. In small-scale yielding,  K uniquely characterizes crack-tip conditions,
despite the fact that the singularity does not exist all the way to the crack tip.  Similarly,  J
uniquely characterizes crack-tip conditions even though the deformation plasticity and small strainassumptions are invalid within the ﬁnite strain region.
Figure 3.23(b) illustrates elastic-plastic conditions, where  J is still approximately valid, but there is
no longer a K ﬁeld. As the plastic zone increases in size (relative to L), the K-dominated zone disappears,
but the J-dominated zone persists in some geometries. Thus although  K has no meaning in this case,
the J integral is still an appropriate fracture criterion. Since  J dominance implies CTOD  dominance, the
latter parameter can also be applied in the elastic-plastic regime.JbDo=07 3.σΩ

130 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
With large-scale yielding (Figure 3.23(c)), the size of the ﬁnite strain zone becomes signiﬁcant
relative to L, and there is no longer a region uniquely characterized by  J. Single-parameter fracture
mechanics is invalid in large-scale yielding, and critical  J values exhibit a size and geometry dependence. 
In certain conﬁgurations, the K and J  zones are vanishingly small, and a single-parameter descrip-
tion is not possible except at very low loads. For example, a plate loaded in tension with a through-
thickness crack is not amenable to a single-parameter description, either by K or J. Example 2.7 and
Figure 2.39 indicate that the stress in the x direction in this geometry deviates signiﬁcantly from the
elastic singularity solution at small distances from the crack tip because of a compressive transverse(T) stress. Consequently the K-dominated zone is virtually nonexistent. The T stress inﬂuences stresses
inside the plastic zone, so a highly negative T stress also invalidates a single-parameter description
in terms of J. See Section 3.61 for further details about the T stress.
Recall Section 2.10.1, where a free-body diagram was constructed from a disk-shaped region
removed from the crack tip of a structure loaded in small-scale yielding. Since the stresses on theboundary of this disk exhibit a singularity, K
I uniquely deﬁnes the stresses and strains within
the disk. For a given material,5 dimensional analysis leads to the following functional relationship
for the stress distribution within this region:
for (3.59)
where rs is the radius of the elastic singularity dominated zone, which may depend on q. Note that the
singularity is a special case of F, which exhibits a different dependence on r within the plastic
zone. Invoking the relationship between  J and KI for small-scale yielding (Equation 3.18) gives
for (3.60)
where rJ is the radius of the  J-dominated zone. The HRR singularity (Equation (3.24a)) is a special
case of Equation (3.60), but stress exhibits a dependence only over a limited range of r.
For small-scale yielding, rs = rJ, but rs vanishes when the plastic zone engulfs the elastic
singularity dominated zone. The  J-dominated zone usually persists longer than the elastic singularity
zone, as Figure 3.23 illustrates.
It is important to emphasize that the J dominance at the crack tip does not require the existence
of an HRR singularity. In fact,  J dominance requires only that Equation (3.60) is valid in the process
zone near the crack tip, where the microscopic events that lead to fracture occur. The HRRsingularity is merely one possible solution to the more general requirement that  J uniquely deﬁne
crack-tip stresses and strains. The ﬂow properties of most materials do not conform to the ideali-zation of a Ramberg-Osgood power law, upon which the HRR analysis is based. Even in a Ramberg-Osgood material, the HRR singularity is valid over a limited range; large strain effects invalidatethe HRR singularity close to the crack tip, and the computed stress lies below the HRR solutionat greater distances. The latter effect can be understood by considering the analytical techniqueemployed by Hutchinson [7], who represented the stress solution as an inﬁnite series and showedthat the leading term in the series was proportional to (see Appendix 3.4). This singularterm dominates as r → 0; higher-order terms are signiﬁcant for moderate values of r. When the
computed stress ﬁeld deviates from HRR, it still scales with J/(s
o r), as required by Equation (3.60).
Thus J dominance does not necessarily imply agreement with the HRR ﬁelds.
5 A complete statement of the functional relationship of σij should include all material ﬂow properties (e.g., α and n for a
Ramberg-Osgood material). These quantities were omitted from Equation (3.59) and Equation (3.60) for the sake of clarity,
since material properties are assumed to be ﬁxed in this problem.1r

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 131
Equation (3.59) and Equation (3.60) gradually become invalid as specimen boundaries interact
with the crack tip. We can apply dimensional arguments to infer when a single-parameter description
of crack-tip conditions is suspect. As discussed in Chapter 2, the LEFM solution breaks down whenthe plastic-zone size is a signiﬁcant fraction of in-plane dimensions. Moreover, the crack-tipconditions evolve from plane strain to plane stress as the plastic-zone size grows to a signiﬁcantfraction of the thickness. The  J integral becomes invalid as a crack-tip-characterizing parameter
when the large strain region reaches a ﬁnite size relative to in-plane dimensions. Section 3.6 providesquantitative information on size effects.
3.5.2J-CONTROLLED  CRACK GROWTH
According to the dimensional argument in the previous section,  J-controlled  conditions exist at the
tip of a stationary crack (loaded monotonically and quasistatically), provided the large strain regionis small compared to the in-plane dimensions of the cracked body. Stable crack growth, however,introduces another length dimension, i.e., the change in the crack length from its original value.Thus J may not characterize crack-tip conditions when the crack growth is signiﬁcant compared
to the in-plane dimensions. Prior crack growth should not have any adverse effects in a purelyelastic material, because the local crack-tip ﬁelds depend only on current conditions. However,prior history does inﬂuence the stresses and strains in an elastic-plastic material. Therefore, wemight expect the J integral theory to break down when there is a combination of signiﬁcant plasticity
and crack growth. This heuristic argument based on dimensional analysis agrees with experimentand with more complex analyses.
Figure 3.24 illustrates crack growth under J-controlled conditions. The material behind the
growing crack tip has unloaded elastically. Recall Figure 3.7, which compares the unloadingbehavior of nonlinear elastic and elastic-plastic materials; the material in the unloading region ofFigure 3.24 obviously violates the assumptions of deformation plasticity. The material directly infront of the crack also violates the single-parameter assumption because the loading is highlynonproportional, i.e., the various stress components increase at different rates and some componentsactually decrease. In order for the crack growth to be  J controlled, the elastic unloading and non-
proportional plastic loading regions must be embedded within a zone of  J dominance. When the
crack grows out of the zone of  J dominance, the measured R curve is no longer uniquely charac-
terized by J.
In small-scale yielding, there is always a zone of  J dominance because the crack-tip conditions
are deﬁned by the elastic stress intensity, which depends only on the current values of the load andcrack size. The crack never grows out of the J-dominated zone as long as all the specimen boundaries
are remote from the crack tip and the plastic zone.
Figure 3.25 illustrates three distinct stages of crack growth resistance behavior in small-scale
yielding. During the initial stage the crack is essentially stationary; the ﬁnite slope of the R curve

is caused by blunting. The crack-tip ﬁelds for Stage 1 are given by
(3.61)
which is a restatement of Equation (3.60). The crack begins to grow in Stage 2. The crack-tip
stresses and strains are probably inﬂuenced by the original blunt crack tip during the early stagesof crack growth. Dimensional analysis implies the following relationship:
(3.62)
where d
i is the CTOD  at initiation of stable tearing. When the crack grows well beyond the initial
blunted tip, a steady-state condition is reached, where the local stresses and strains are independentof the extent of crack growth:
(3.63)
Although Equation (3.61) and Equation (3.63) would predict identical conditions in the elastic-singularity zone, the material in the plastic zone at the tip of a growing crack is likely to experiencea different loading history from the material in the plastic zone of a blunting stationary crack; thusF
(1) ≠ F(3) as r → 0. During steady-state crack growth, a plastic zone of constant size sweeps throughFIGURE 3.25 Three stages of crack growth in an inﬁnite body.

the material, leaving a plastic wake, as illustrated in Figure 3.25. The R curve is ﬂat;  J does not increase
with crack extension, provided the material properties do not vary with position. Appendix 3.5.2
presents a formal mathematical argument for a ﬂat R curve during steady-state growth; a heuristic
explanation is given below.
If Equation (3.63) applies,  J uniquely describes crack-tip conditions, independent of crack exten-
sion. If the material fails at some critical combination of stresses and strains, it follows that localfailure at the crack tip must occur at a critical  J value, as in the stationary crack case. This critical  J
value must remain constant with crack growth. A rising or falling R curve would imply that the local
material properties varied with position.
The second stage in Figure 3.25 corresponds to the transition between the blunting of a stationary
crack and crack growth under steady state conditions. A rising R curve is possible in Stage 2. For
small-scale yielding conditions the R curve depends only on crack extension:
(3.64)
That is, the J-R curve is a material property.
The steady-state limit is usually not observed in laboratory tests on ductile materials. In typical
test specimens, the ligament is fully plastic during crack growth, thereby violating the small-scaleyielding assumption. Moreover, the crack approaches a ﬁnite boundary while still in Stage 2 growth.Enormous specimens would be required to observe steady-state crack growth in tough materials.
3.6 CRA CK-TIP CONSTRAINT UNDER LARGE-SCALE YIELDING
Under small-scale yielding conditions, a single parameter (e.g., K, J, or CTOD) characterizes crack-
tip conditions and can be used as a geometry-independent fracture criterion. Single-parameterfracture mechanics breaks down in the presence of excessive plasticity, and the fracture toughnessdepends on the size and geometry of the test specimen.
McClintock [18] applied the slip line theory to estimate the stresses in a variety of conﬁgurations
under plane strain, fully plastic conditions. Figure 3.26 summarizes some of these results. Forsmall-scale yielding (Figure 3.26(a)), the maximum stress at the crack tip is approximately 3 s
o in
a nonhardening material. According to the slip line analysis, a deeply notched double-edged notchedtension (DENT) panel, illustrated in Figure 3.26(b), maintains a high level of triaxiality under fullyplastic conditions, such that the crack-tip conditions are similar to the small-scale yielding case.An edge-cracked plate in bending (Figure 3.26(c)) exhibits slightly less stress elevation, with themaximum principal stress approximately 2.5 s
o. A center-cracked panel in pure tension (Figure 3.26(d))
is incapable of maintaining signiﬁcant triaxiality under fully plastic conditions.
The results in Figure 3.26 indicate that for a nonhardening material under fully yielded condi-
tions, the stresses near the crack tip are not unique, but depend on geometry. Traditional fracturemechanics approaches recognize that the stress and strain ﬁelds remote from the crack tip maydepend on geometry, but it is assumed that the near-tip ﬁelds have a similar form in all conﬁgurationsthat can be scaled by a single parameter. The single-parameter assumption is obviously not validfor nonhardening materials under fully plastic conditions, because the near-tip ﬁelds depend on theconﬁguration. Fracture toughness, whether quantiﬁed by  J, K, or CTOD, must also depend on the
conﬁguration.
The prospects for applying fracture mechanics in the presence of large-scale yielding are not
quite as bleak as the McClintock analysis indicates. The conﬁgurational effects on the near-tipﬁelds are much less severe when the material exhibits strain hardening. Moreover, single-parameterfracture mechanics may be approximately valid in the presence of signiﬁcant plasticity, providedthe specimen maintains a relatively high level of triaxiality. Both the DENT specimen and the edge-cracked plate in bending (SE(B)) apparently satisfy this requirement. Most laboratory measurementsJJaRR=()∆1656_C003.fm  Page 133  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:42 PM

of fracture toughness are performed with bend-type specimens, such as the compact and three-
point bend geometries, because these specimens present the fewest experimental difﬁculties.
Figure 3.27 compares the cleavage-fracture toughness for bending and tensile loading. Although
the scatter bands overlap, the average toughness for the single-edge-notched bend specimens isconsiderably lower than that of the center-cracked tension panels or the surface-cracked panels.
Crack depth and specimen size can also have an effect on fracture toughness, as Figure 3.28
illustrates. Note that the bend specimens with shallow cracks tend to have higher toughness thanFIGURE 3.26 Comparison of the plastic deformation pattern in small-scale yielding (a) with slip patterns

deep-cracked specimens, and the specimens with 50 mm × 50 mm cross sections have a lower
average toughness than smaller specimens with the same a/W ratio.
Figure 3.27 and Figure 3.28 illustrate the effect of specimen size and geometry on cleavage-
fracture toughness. Specimen conﬁguration can also inﬂuence the R curve of ductile materials.
Figure 3.29 shows the effect of crack depth on crack growth resistance behavior. Note that the
trend is the same as in Figure 3.28. Joyce and Link [21] measured J-R curves for several geometries
and found that the initiation toughness JIc is relatively insensitive to geometry (Figure 3.30), but
the tearing modulus, as deﬁned in Equation (3.49), is a strong function of geometry (Figure 3.31).Conﬁgurations that have a high level of constraint under full plastic conditions, such as the compactand deep-notched SE(B) specimens, have low T
R values relative to low constraint geometries, such
as single edge notched tension panels.
Note that the DENT specimens have the highest tearing modulus in Figure 3.31, but
McClintock’s slip-line analysis indicates that this conﬁguration should have a high level of con-straint under fully plastic conditions. Joyce and Link presented elastic-plastic ﬁnite element resultsfor the DENT specimen that indicated signiﬁcant constraint loss in this geometry,
6 which is
consistent with the observed elevated tearing modulus. Thus the slip-line analysis apparently doesnot reﬂect the actual crack-tip conditions of this geometry.
A number of researchers have attempted to extend fracture mechanics theory beyond the limits
of the single-parameter assumption. Most of these new approaches involve the introduction of a secondparameter to characterize crack-tip conditions. Several such methodologies are described later.FIGURE 3.29 Effect of crack length/specimen width ratio on J-R curves for HY130 steel single-edge-notched

ﬁelds (see Chapter 2). Although the third and higher terms in the Williams solution, which
have positive exponents on r, vanish at the crack tip, the second (uniform) term remains ﬁnite.
It turns out that this second term can have a profound effect on the plastic zone shape and the
stresses deep inside the plastic zone [24, 25].
For a crack in an isotropic elastic material subject to plane strain Mode I loading, the ﬁrst two
terms of the Williams solution are as follows:
(3.65)
where T is a uniform stress in the x direction (which induces a stress nT in the z direction in plane
strain).
We can assess the inﬂuence of the T stress by constructing a circular model that contains a
crack, as illustrated in Figure 3.32. On the boundary of this model, let us apply in-plane tractionsthat correspond to Equation (3.65). A plastic zone develops at the crack tip, but its size must besmall relative to the size of the model in order to ensure the validity of the boundary conditions,which are inferred from an elastic solution. This conﬁguration, often referred to as a modiﬁed
boundary layer analysis , simulates the near-tip conditions in an arbitrary geometry, provided the
plasticity is well contained within the body. It is equivalent to removing a core region from thecrack tip and constructing a free-body diagram, as in Figure 2.43.
Figure 3.33 is a plot of ﬁnite element results from a modiﬁed boundary layer analysis [26] that
show the effect of the T stress on stresses deep inside the plastic zone. The special case of T = 0
corresponds to the small-scale yielding limit, where the plastic zone is a negligible fraction of the cracklength and size of the body,
7 and the singular term uniquely deﬁnes the near-tip ﬁelds. The single-
parameter description is rigorously correct only for T = 0. Note that negative T values cause a
signiﬁcant downward shift in the stress ﬁelds. Positive T values shift the stresses to above the small-
scale yielding limit, but the effect is much less pronounced than it is for the negative T stress.
Note that the HRR solution does not match the T = 0 case. The stresses deep inside the plastic
zone can be represented by a power series, where the HRR solution is the leading term. Figure 3.33indicates that the higher-order plastic terms are not negligible when T = 0. A single-parameter
description in terms of J is still valid, however, as discussed in Section 3.5.1.FIGURE 3.32 Modiﬁed boundary layer analysis. The ﬁrst two terms of the Williams series are applied as
boundary conditions.
7 In this case, ‘‘body’’ refers to the global conﬁguration, not the modiﬁed boundary layer model. A modiﬁed boundary layer
model with T = 0 simulates an inﬁnite body with an inﬁnitely long crack.

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 139
In a cracked body subject to Mode I loading, the T stress, like KI, scales with the applied load.
The biaxiality ratio  relates T to stress intensity:
(3.66)
For a through-thickness crack in an inﬁnite plate subject to a remote normal stress (Figure 2.3),
b = −1. Thus a remote stress s induces a T stress of – s in the x direction. Recall Example 2.7,
where a rough estimate of the elastic-singularity zone and plastic zone size led to the conclusionthat K breaks down in this conﬁguration when the applied stress exceeds 35% of the yield, which
corresponds to T/s
o = −0.35. From Figure 3.33, we see that such a T stress leads to a signiﬁcant
relaxation in crack-tip stresses, relative to the small-scale yielding case.
For laboratory specimens with KI solutions of the form in Table 2.4, the T stress is given by
(3.67)
Figure 3.34 is a plot of b for several geometries. Note that b is positive for deeply notched SENT
and SE(B) specimens, where the uncracked ligament is subject predominately to bending stresses.As discussed above, such conﬁgurations maintain a high level of constraint under fully plasticconditions. Thus a positive T stress in the elastic case generally leads to high constraint under
fully plastic conditions, while geometries with negative T stress lose constraint rapidly with
deformation. 
The biaxiality ratio can be used as a qualitative index of the relative crack-tip constraint of
various geometries. The T stress, combined with the modiﬁed boundary layer solution (Figure 3.33)FIGURE 3.33 Stress ﬁelds obtained from modiﬁed boundary layer analysis. Taken from Kirk, M.T., Dodds,

can also be used quantitatively  to estimate the crack-tip stress ﬁeld in a particular geometry [26–28].
For a given load level, the T stress can be inferred from Equation (3.66) or Equation (3.67), and
the corresponding crack-tip stress ﬁeld for the same T stress can be estimated from the modiﬁed
boundary layer solution with the same applied T. This methodology has limitations, however,
because T is an elastic  parameter. A T stress estimated from load through Equation (3.67) has no
physical meaning under fully plastic conditions. Errors in stress ﬁelds inferred from T stress and
the modiﬁed boundary layer solution increase with plastic deformation. This approximate procedure
works fairly well for | b | > 0.9 but breaks down when | b | < 0.4 [26].
3.6.2J-Q THEORY
Assuming the small-strain theory, the crack-tip ﬁelds deep inside the plastic zone can be represen-ted by a power series, where the HRR solution is the leading term. The higher-order terms can begrouped together into a difference ﬁeld:
(3.68a)
Alternatively, the difference ﬁeld can be deﬁned as the deviation from the T = 0 reference solution:
(3.68b)
Note from Figure 3.33 that nonzero T stresses cause the near-tip ﬁeld at q = 0 to shift up or
down uniformly, i.e., the magnitude of the shift is constant with distance from the crack tip.O’Dowd and Shih [29, 30] observed that the difference ﬁeld is relatively constant with bothdistance and angular position in the forward sector of the crack-tip region (| q| ≤ p/2). Moreover,FIGURE 3.34 Biaxiality ratio for single-edge-notched bend, single-edge-notched tension, double-edge-

they noted that
for 
Thus the difference ﬁeld corresponds approximately to a uniform hydrostatic shift of the stress
ﬁeld in front of the crack tip. O’Dowd and Shih designated the amplitude of this approximatedifference ﬁeld by the letter Q. Equation (3.68b) then becomes

researchers deﬁned Q as follows:

Referring to Figure 3.33, we see that Q is negative when T is negative. For the modiﬁed boundary
layer solution, T and Q are uniquely related. Figure 3.35 is a plot of Q vs. T for a wide range of
hardening exponents.
In a given cracked body, Q = 0 in the limit of small-scale yielding, but Q generally becomes
increasingly negative with deformation. Figure 3.36 shows the evolution of Q for a deeply cracked
bend (SENB) specimen and a center-cracked panel. Note that the SENB specimen stays close tothe Q = 0 limit to fairly high deformation levels, but Q for the center-cracked panel becomes highly
negative at relatively small J values.

142 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
3.6.2.1 T he J-Q Toughness Locus
Classical single-parameter fracture mechanics assumes that fracture toughness is a material con-
stant. With the J-Q theory, however, an additional degree of freedom has been introduced, which
implies that the critical J value for a given material depends on Q:
(3.71)
Thus fracture toughness is no longer viewed as a single value; rather, it is a curve that deﬁnes a
critical locus of J and Q values.
Figure 3.37 is a plot of critical J values (for cleavage fracture) as a function of Q [29]. Although
there is some scatter, the trend in Figure 3.37 is clear. The critical J increases as Q becomes more
negative. This trend is consistent with Figures 3.27–3.31. That is, fracture toughness tends toincrease as the constraint decreases. The Q parameter is a direct measure of the relative stress
triaxiality (constraint) at the crack tip.
Since the T stress is also an indication of the level of crack-tip constraint, a J-T failure locus
can be constructed [27, 28]. Such plots have similar trends to J-Q plots, but the ordering of data
points sometimes differs. That is, the relative ranking of geometries can be inﬂuenced by whetherthe constraint is quantiﬁed by T or Q. Under well-contained yielding, T and Q are uniquely related
(Figure 3.35), but the T stress loses its meaning for large-scale yielding. Thus, a J-T toughness
locus is unreliable when signiﬁcant yielding precedes fracture.
The single-parameter fracture mechanics theory assumes that toughness values obtained from
laboratory specimens can be transferred to structural applications. Two-parameter approaches suchas the J-Q theory imply that the laboratory specimen must match the constraint of the structure,
i.e., the two geometries must have the same Q at failure in order for the respective J
c values to beFIGURE 3.36 Evolution of the Q parameter with deformation in two geometries. Taken from O’Dowd, N.P.

equal. Figure 3.38 illustrates the application of the J-Q approach to structures. The applied J vs. Q
curve for the conﬁguration of interest is obtained from ﬁnite element analysis and plotted with the
J-Q toughness locus. Failure is predicted when the driving force curve passes through the toughness
locus. Since toughness data are often scattered, however, there is not a single unambiguous crossoverpoint. Rather, there is a range of possible J
c values for the structure.FIGURE 3.37 J-Q toughness locus for SE(B) specimens of A515 Grade 70 steel. Taken from Shih, C.F.,

3.6.2.2 Effect of F ailure Mec hanism on the J-Q Locus
The J-Q approach is descriptive but not predictive. That is, Q quantiﬁes the crack-tip constraint,
but it gives no indication as to the effect of constraint on fracture toughness. A J-Q failure locus,
such as Figure 3.37, can be inferred from a series of experiments on a range of geometries. Alter-
natively, a micromechanical failure criterion can be invoked.
Consider, for example, the Ritchie-Knott-Rice (RKR) [32] model for cleavage fracture, which
states that fracture occurs when a critical fracture stress sf is exceeded over a characteristic
distance rc. As an approximation, let us replace the T = 0 reference solution with the HRR ﬁeld in
Equation (3.69):
(3.72)
Setting the stress normal to the crack plane equal to sf  and r = rc, and relating the resulting equation
to the Q = 0 limit leads to
(3.73)
where Jo is the critical J value for the Q = 0 small-scale yielding limit. Rearranging gives
(3.74)
which is a prediction of the J-Q toughness locus. Equation (3.74) predicts that toughness is highly
sensitive to Q, since the quantity in brackets is raised to the n + 1 power.
The shape of the J-Q locus depends on the failure mechanism. Equation (3.74) refers to stress-
controlled fracture, such as cleavage in metals, but strain-controlled fracture is less sensitive to thecrack-tip constraint. A simple parametric study illustrates the inﬂuence of the local failure criterion.
Suppose that fracture occurs when a damage parameter Φ reaches a critical value r
c ahead of
the crack tip, where Φ is given by
(3.75)
where sm is the mean (hydrostatic) stress and is the equivalent plastic strain. When γ = 1,
Equation (3.75) corresponds to stress-controlled fracture, similar to the RKR model. The otherlimit g = 0 corresponds to strain-controlled failure. By varying g and applying Equation (3.75) to
the ﬁnite element results of O’Dowd and Shih [29, 30], we obtain a family of J-Q toughness loci,
which are plotted in Figure 3.39. The J-Q locus for stress-controlled fracture is highly sensitive
to constraint, as expected. For strain-controlled fracture, the locus has a slight negative slope,indicating that toughness decreases  as constraint relaxes. As Q decreases (i.e., becomes more
negative), crack-tip stresses relax, but the plastic strain  ﬁelds at a given J value increase  with
constraint loss. Thus as constraint relaxes, a smaller J
c is required for failure for a purely strain-
controlled mechanism. The predicted Jc is nearly constant for g = 0.5. Microvoid growth in metals
is governed by a combination of plastic strain and hydrostatic stress (see Chapter 5). Consequently,critical J values for the initiation of ductile crack growth are relatively insensitive to geometry,
as Figure 3.30 indicates.σσ σ δij ij HRR o ijQ ≈+()

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 145
According to Figure 3.31, the slope of the J resistance curve is inﬂuenced by specimen
conﬁguration. However, the stress and strain ﬁelds ahead of a growing crack are different from the
stationary crack case [16, 17], and the J-Q theory is not applicable to a growing crack.
3.6.3 S CALING  MODEL FOR CLEAVAGE  FRACTURE
Both the J-Q  and T stress methodologies are based on continuum theory. As stated above, these
approaches characterize the crack-tip ﬁelds but they cannot predict the effect of these ﬁelds on amaterial’s fracture resistance. A micromechanical failure criterion must be introduced to relatecrack-tip ﬁelds to fracture toughness. The RKR model provides a simple means for such predictions.Anderson and Dodds [34–36] have developed a somewhat more sophisticated model for cleavage,which is described below.
3.6.3.1 Failure Criterion
Cleavage initiation usually involves a local Grifﬁth instability of a microcrack which forms from a
microstructural feature such as a carbide or inclusion. The Grifﬁth energy balance is satisﬁed when acritical stress is reached in the vicinity of the microcrack. The size and location of the critical micro-structural feature dictate the fracture toughness; thus cleavage toughness is subject to considerablescatter. See Chapter 5 for a more detailed description of the micromechanisms of cleavage fracture.
The Grifﬁth instability criterion implies fracture at a critical normal stress near the tip of the crack;
the statistical sampling nature of cleavage initiation (i.e., the probability of ﬁnding a critical microstruc-tural feature near the crack tip) suggests that the volume of the process zone is also important. Thus theprobability of cleavage fracture in a cracked specimen can be expressed in the following general form:
(3.76)FIGURE 3.39 Effect of failure criterion on the J-Q locus. Fracture is assumed to occur when Φ reaches a
critical value at a speciﬁc distance from the crack tip. Taken from Anderson, T.L., Vanaparthy, N.M.R., and

where 
F = failure probability
s1 = maximum principal stress at a point
V(s1) = cumulative volume sampled where the principal stress is ≥ s1
For a specimen subjected to plane strain conditions along the crack front, V = BA , where B is
the specimen thickness and A is the cumulative area on the x-y plane.
The Jo Parameter
For small-scale yielding, dimensional analysis shows that the principal stress ahead of the crack
tip can be written as
(3.77)
Equation (3.77) implies that the crack-tip stress ﬁelds depend only on J. When J dominance is lost,
there is a relaxation in triaxiality; the principal stress at a ﬁxed r and q  is less than the small-scale
yielding value.
Equation (3.77) can be inverted to solve for the radius corresponding to a given stress and angle:
(3.78)
Solving for the area inside a speciﬁc principal stress contour gives
(3.79)
where
(3.80)
Thus, for a given stress, the area scales with J2 in the case of small-scale yielding. Under large-
scale yielding conditions, the test specimen or structure experiences a loss in constraint, and thearea inside a given principal stress contour (at a given J value) is less than predicted from small-
scale yielding:
(3.81)
where f is a constraint factor that is ≤1. Let us deﬁne an effective  J in large-scale yielding that
relates the area inside the principal stress contour to the small-scale yielding case:

where Jo is the effective small-scale yielding J, i.e., the value of J that would result in the area
A(s1/so) if the structure were large relative to the plastic zone, and T = Q = 0. Therefore, the ratio
of the applied J to the effective J is given by
(3.83)
The small-scale yielding J value ( Jo) can be viewed as the effective driving force for cleava ge ,
while J is the apparent driving force.
The J/Jo ratio quantiﬁes the size dependence of cleavage fracture toughness. Consider, for
example, a ﬁnite size test specimen that fails at Jc = 200 kPa m. If the J/Jo ratio were 2.0 in this
case, a very large specimen made from the same material would fail at Jc = 100 kPa m. An equivalent
toughness ratio in terms of the crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) can also be deﬁned.
3.6.3.2 Three-Dimensional Effects
The constraint model described above considers only stressed areas in front of the crack tip. This
model is incomplete, because it is the volume of material sampled ahead of the crack tip that controls
the cleavage fracture. The stressed volume obviously scales with specimen thickness (or crack front
length in the more general case). Moreover, the stressed volume is a function of the constraint parallelto the crack front; a higher constraint results in a larger volume, as is the case for in-plane constraint.
One way to treat three-dimensional constraint effects is to deﬁne an effective thickness based
on an equivalent two-dimensional case. Consider a three-dimensional specimen that is loaded to agiven J value. If we choose a principal stress value and construct contours at two-dimensional
slices on the x-y plane, the area inside of these contours will vary along the crack front because
the center of the specimen is more highly constrained than the free surface, as Figure 3.40 illustrates.The volume can be obtained by summing the areas in these two-dimensional contours. This volumecan then be related to an equivalent two-dimensional specimen loaded to the same J value:
(3.84)
where A
c is the area inside the s1 contour on the center plane of the three-dimensional specimen
and Beff is the effective thickness.

148 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The effective thickness inﬂuences the cleavage driving force through a sample volume effect: longer
crack fronts have a higher probability of cleavage fracture because more volume is sampled along the
crack front. This effect can be characterized by a three-parameter Weibull distribution (See Chapter 5):
(3.85)
where
B = thickness (or crack front length)
Bo = reference thickness
Kmin = threshold toughness
ΘK = 63rd percentile toughness when B = Bo
Consider two samples with effective crack front lengths B1 and B2. If a value of KJC(1) is measured
for Specimen 1, the expected toughness for Specimen 2 can be inferred from Equation (3.85) byequating failure probabilities:
(3.86)
Equation (3.86) is a statistical thickness adjustment that can be used to relate two sets of data withdifferent thicknesses.
3.6.3.3 Application of the Model
As with the J-Q approach, the implementation of the scaling model requires detailed elastic-plastic
ﬁnite element analysis of the conﬁguration of interest. The principal stress contours must be con-
structed and the areas compared with the T = 0 reference solution obtained from a modiﬁed boundary
layer analysis. The effective driving force J
o is then plotted against the applied J, as Figure 3.41
schematically illustrates. At low deformation levels, the Jo-J curves follow the 1:1 line, but deviate
from the line with further deformation. When JJo, the crack-tip stress ﬁelds are close to the Q = 0
limit, and fracture toughness is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by specimen boundaries. At high defor-mation levels J > J
o and the fracture toughness is artiﬁcially elevated by constraint loss. Constraint
loss occurs more rapidly in specimens with shallow cracks, as Figure 3.28 illustrates. A specimenwith a/W = 0.15 would tend to fail at a higher J
c value than a specimen with a/W = 0.5. Given the
Jo-J curve, however, the Jc values for both specimens can be corrected to Jo, as Figure 3.41 illustrates.
Figure 3.42 is a nondimensional plot of Jo at the midplane vs. the average J through the
thickness of SENB specimens with various W/B ratios [36]. These curves were inferred from a
FIGURE 3.41 Schematic illustration of the scaling
model. A specimen with a/W = 0.15 will fail at a
higher Jc value than a specimen with a/W = 0.5, but
both Jc values can be corrected down to the same
critical Jo value.FB

three-dimensional elastic-plastic analysis. The corresponding curve from a two-dimensional plane
strain analysis is shown for comparison. Note that for W/B = 1 and 2, Jo at the midplane lies well
above the plane-strain curve. For W/B = 4, Jo at the midplane follows the plane-strain curve initially,
but falls below the plane-strain results at high deformation levels. The three-dimensional nature ofthe plastic deformation apparently results in a high level of constraint at the midplane when theuncracked ligament length is ≤ the specimen thickness.
Figure 3.43 is a plot of effective thickness B
eff as a function of deformation. The trends in this
plot are consistent with Figure 3.42; namely, the constraint increases with decreasing W/B. Note that
all three curves reach a plateau. Recall that Beff is deﬁned in such a way as to be a measure of the
through-thickness relaxation of constraint, relative to the in-plane constraint at the midplane. At lowdeformation levels there is negligible relation at the midplane and J ≈ J
o, but a through-thickness
constraint relation occurs, resulting in a falling Beff/B ratio. At high deformation levels, the Beff/B
ratio is essentially constant, indicating that the constraint relaxation is proportional in three dimen-sions. Figure 3.44 and Figure 3.45 show data that have been corrected with the scaling model.
3.6.4 L IMITATIONS  OF TWO-PARAMETER  FRACTURE  MECHANICS
The T stress approach, J-Q theory, and the cleavage scaling model are examples of two-
parameter fracture theories, where a second quantity (e.g., T, Q, or Jo) has been introduced to
characterize the crack-tip environment. Thus these approaches assume that the crack-tip ﬁeldscontain two degrees of freedom. When single-parameter fracture mechanics is valid, the crack-tip ﬁelds have only one degree of freedom. In such cases, any one of several parameters (e.g.,J, K, or CTOD) will sufﬁce to characterize the crack-tip conditions, provided the parameter
can be deﬁned unambiguously; K is a suitable characterizing parameter only when an elastic
singularity zone exists ahead of the crack tip.
8 Similarly, the choice of a second parameter inFIGURE 3.42 Effective driving force for cleavage Jo for deeply notched SENB specimens.
8 An effective K can be inferred from J through Equation (3.18). Such a parameter has units of K, but it loses its meaning
as the amplitude of the elastic singularity when such a singularity no longer exists.

the case of two-parameter theory is mostly arbitrary, but the T stress has no physical meaning
under large-scale yielding conditions.
Just as plastic ﬂow invalidates single-parameter fracture mechanics in many geometries, two-
parameter theories eventually break down with extensive deformation. If we look at the structure
of the crack-tip ﬁelds in the plastic zone, we can evaluate the range of validity of both single- andtwo-parameter methodologies.
A number of investigators [39–43] have performed asymptotic analyses of the crack-tip ﬁelds
for elastic-plastic materials. These analyses utilize deformation plasticity and small-strain theory.In the case of plane strain, these analyses assume incompressible strain. Consequently, asymptoticanalyses are not valid close to the crack tip (in the large-strain zone) nor remote from the cracktip, where elastic strains are a signiﬁcant fraction of the total strain. Despite these limitations,asymptotic analysis provides insights into the range of validity of both single- and two-parameterfracture theories.
In the case of a plane strain crack in a power-law-hardening material, asymptotic analysis leads
to the following power series:

The exponents sk and the angular functions for each term in the series can be determined from the
asymptotic analysis. The amplitudes for the ﬁrst ﬁve terms are as follows:
The two unspeciﬁed coefﬁcients A2 and A4 are governed by the far-ﬁeld boundary conditions. The
ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the series have three degrees of freedom, where J, A2, and A4 are independent
parameters. For low and moderate strain hardening materials, Crane [43] showed that a fourth
independent parameter does not appear in the series for many terms. For example, when n = 10,
the fourth independent coefﬁcient appears in approximately the 100th term. Thus for all practicalpurposes, the crack-tip stress ﬁeld inside the plastic zone has three degrees of freedom.
Since two-parameter theories assume two degrees of freedom, they cannot be rigorously correct
in general. There are, however, situations where two-parameter approaches provide a good engineeringapproximation.
Consider the modiﬁed boundary layer model in Figure 3.32. Since the boundary conditions
have only two degrees of freedom ( K and T), the resulting stresses and strains inside the plastic
zone must be two-parameter ﬁelds. Thus there must be a unique relationship between A
2 and A4 in
this case. That is
(3.88)
The two-parameter theory is approximately valid for other geometries to the extent that the
crack-tip ﬁelds obey Equation (3.88). Figure 3.46 schematically illustrates the A2-A4 relationship.
This relationship can be established by varying the boundary conditions on the modiﬁed boundarylayer model. When a given cracked geometry is loaded, A
2 and A4 initially will evolve in accordance
with Equation (3.88) because the crack-tip conditions in the geometry of interest can be representedby the modiﬁed boundary layer model when the plastic zone is relatively small. Under large-scaleyielding conditions, however, the A
2-A4 relationship may deviate from the modiﬁed boundary layer
solution, in which case the two-parameter theory is no longer valid.
Figure 3.47 is a schematic three-dimensional plot of J, A2, and A4. Single-parameter fracture
mechanics can be represented by a vertical line, since A2 and A4 must be constant in this case.
The two-parameter theory, where Equation (3.88) applies, can be represented by a surface inthis three-dimensional space. The loading path for a cracked body initially follows the vertical

single-parameter line. When it deviates from this line, it may remain in the two-parameter surface
for a time before diverging from the surface.
The loading path in J-A2-A4 space depends on geometry [43]. Low-constraint conﬁgurations
such as the center-cracked panel and shallow notched bend specimens diverge from the single-parameter theory almost immediately, but follow Equation (3.88) to fairly high deformation levels.Deeply notched bend specimens maintain a high constraint to relatively high J values, but they do
not follow Equation (3.88) when constraint loss eventually occurs. Thus low-constraint geometriesshould be treated with the two-parameter theory, and high-constraint geometries can be treatedwith the single-parameter theory in many cases. When high-constraint geometries violate the single-parameter assumption, however, the two-parameter theory is of little value.
APPENDIX 3: MATHEMATIC AL FOUNDA TIONS OF ELASTIC-PLASTIC 
FRACTURE MECHANICS
A3.1 D ETERMINING  CTOD FROM THE STRIP-YIELD MODEL
Burdekin and Stone [3] applied the Westergaard [44] complex stress function approach to the strip-yield model. They derived an expression for CTOD  by superimposing a stress function for closure
forces on the crack faces in the strip-yield zone. Their result was similar to previous analyses basedon the strip-yield model performed by Bilby et al. [45] and Smith [46].
Recall from Appendix 2.3 that the Westergaard approach expresses the in-plane stresses (in a
limited number of cases) in terms of Z:
(A3.1a)
(A3.1b)
(A3.1c)
where Z is an analytic function of the complex variable z = x + iy, and the prime denotes a ﬁrst
derivative with respect to z. By invoking the equations of elasticity for the plane problem, it can
be shown that the displacement in the y direction is as follows:

for plane strain (A3.2b)
where  is the integral of Z with respect to z, as discussed in Appendix 2. For a through crack
of length 2 a1 in an inﬁnite plate under biaxial tensile stress s, the Westergaard function is
given by
(A3.3)
where the origin is deﬁned at the crack center.
The stress function for a pair of splitting forces P at ± x within a crack of length  2a1 (see Figure
2.32) is given by

Westergaard stress function is obtained by substituting P = −sYSdx into Equation (A3.4) and inte-
grating:

The stress functions of Equation (A3.3) and Equation (A3.5) can be superimposed, resulting in the
strip-yield solution for the through crack. Recall from Section 2.8.2 that the size of the strip-yield

Recall the J-CTOD  relationship (Equation (3.44)) derived from the strip-yield model. Let us
deﬁne an effective stress intensity for elastic-plastic conditions in terms of the  J integral:
(A3.11)
Combining Equation (3.44), Equation (A3.10) and Equation (A3.11) gives
(A3.12)
which is the strip-yield plastic zone correction given in Equation (2.81) and plotted in Figure 2.33.
Thus the strip-yield correction to KI is equivalent to a J-based approach for a nonhardening material
in plane stress.

where the various terms in this expression are deﬁned in Section 3.2.2. Rice then invoked thedivergence theorem to convert Equation (A3.13) into an area integral:

where A*  is the area enclosed by Γ*. By invoking the deﬁnition of strain energy density given by
Equation (3.20), we can evaluate the ﬁrst term in square brackets in Equation (A3.14):
(A3.15)
Note that Equation (A3.15) applies only when w exhibits the properties of an elastic potential.
Applying the strain-displacement relationship (for small strains) to Equation (A3.15) gives
(A3.16)
since sij = sji. Invoking the equilibrium condition:
(A3.17)
leads to
(A3.18)
which is identical to the second term in square brackets in Equation (A3.14). Thus the integrand

Consider now two arbitrary contours Γ1 and Γ2 around a crack tip, as illustrated in Figure A3.3.
If Γ1 and Γ2 are connected by segments along the crack face ( Γ3 and Γ4), a closed contour is formed.
The total  J along the closed contour is equal to the sum of contributions from each segment:

On the crack face, Ti = dy = 0. Thus, J3 = J4 = 0 and J1 = −J2. Therefore, any arbitrary
(counterclockwise) path around a crack will yield the same value of J; J is path-independent. 
A3.3J AS A NONLINEAR  ELASTIC  ENERGY  RELEASE  RATE
Consider a two-dimensional cracked body bounded by the curve Γ (Figure A3.4). Let A′ denote
the area of the body. The coordinate axis is attached to the crack tip. Under quasistatic conditions
and in the absence of body forces, the potential energy is given by
(A3.20)
where Γ* is the portion of the contour on which the tractions are deﬁned. Let us now consider the
change in potential energy resulting from a virtual extension of the crack:
(A3.21)
The line integration in Equation (A3.21) can be performed over the entire contour Γ because
dui/da = 0 over the region where displacements are speciﬁed; also, dTi/da = 0 over the region the
tractions are speciﬁed. When the crack grows, the coordinate axis moves. Thus a derivative withrespect to crack length can be written as
(A3.22)
since ∂x/∂a = −1. Applying this result to Equation (A3.21) gives
(A3.23)

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 159
By applying the same assumptions as in Equation (A3.15) and Equation (A3.16), we obtain:
(A3.24)
Invoking the principle of virtual work gives
(A3.25)
which cancels with one of the terms in the line integral in Equation (A3.23), resulting in the
following:
(A3.26)
Applying the divergence theorem and multiplying both sides by –1 leads to
(A3.26a)
since nx ds = dy. Therefore, the  J contour integral is equal to the energy release rate for a linear or
nonlinear elastic material under quasistatic conditions.
A3.4 T HE HRR S INGULARITY
Hutchinson [7] and Rice and Rosengren [8] independently evaluated the character of crack-tipstress ﬁelds in the case of power-law-hardening materials. Hutchinson evaluated both plane stressand plane strain, while Rice and Rosengren considered only plane-strain conditions. Both articles,which were published in the same issue of the Journal of the Mec hanics and Physics of Solids ,
argued that stress times strain varies as 1/ r near the crack tip, although only Hutchinson was able
to provide a mathematical proof of this relationship.
The Hutchinson analysis is outlined below. Some of the details are omitted for brevity. We
focus instead on his overall approach and the ramiﬁcations of this analysis.
Hutchinson began by deﬁning a stress function Φ for the problem. The governing differential
equation for deformation plasticity theory for a plane problem in a Ramberg-Osgood material ismore complicated than the linear elastic case:
(A3.27)
where the function g differs for plane stress and plane strain. For the Mode I crack problem,
Hutchinson chose to represent Φ in terms of an asymptotic expansion in the following form:

where C1 and C2 are constants that depend on q, the angle from the crack plane. Equation (A3.28) is
analogous to the Williams expansion for the linear elastic case (Appendix 2.3). If s < t , and t  is less
than all subsequent exponents on r, then the ﬁrst term dominates as  r → 0. If the analysis is
restricted to the region near the crack tip, then the stress function can be expressed as follows:
(A3.29)
where k is the amplitude of the stress function and  is a dimensionless function of  q. Although
Equation (A3.27) is different from the linear elastic case, the stresses can still be derived from
Φ through Equation (A2.6) or Equation (A2.13). Thus the stresses, in polar coordinates, are
given by
(A3.30)
The boundary conditions for the crack problem are as follows:
In the region close to the crack tip where Equation (A3.29) applies, elastic strains are negligible
compared to plastic strains; only the second term in Equation (A3.27) is relevant in this case.Hutchinson substituted the boundary conditions and Equation (A3.29) into Equation (A3.27) andobtained a nonlinear eigenvalue equation for s. He then solved this equation numerically for a range
of n values. The numerical analysis indicated that s could be described quite accurately (for both
plane stress and plane strain) by a simple formula:
(A3.31)
which implies that the strain energy density varies as 1/ r near the crack tip. This numerical analysis
also yielded relative values for the angular functions . The amplitude, however, cannot beobtained without connecting the near-tip analysis with the remote boundary conditions. The  J
contour integral provides a simple means for making this connection in the case of small-scaleyielding. Moreover, by invoking the path-independent property of  J, Hutchinson was able to obtain
a direct proof of the validity of Equation (A3.31).
Consider two circular contours of radius r
1 and r2 around the tip of a crack in small-scale yielding,
as illustrated in Figure A3.5. Assume that r1 is in the region described by the elastic singularity,
while r2 is well inside of the plastic zone, where the stresses are described by Equation (A3.30).
When the stresses and displacements in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 are inserted into Equation (A3.26),and the J integral is evaluated along r
1, one ﬁnds that as expected from the previous
section. Since the connection between KI and the global boundary conditions is well established for
a wide range of conﬁgurations, and  J is path-independent, the near-tip problem for small-scale
yielding can be solved by evaluating  J at r2 and relating  J to the amplitude ( k).ΦΦ=κσ θosr˜()

162 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
In order for  J to be path independent, it cannot depend on r2, which was deﬁned arbitrarily. The
radius vanishes in Equation (A3.34) only when ( n + 1)( s − 2) + 1 = 0, or
which is identical to the result obtained numerically (Equation (A3.31)). Thus the amplitude of the
stress function is given by
(A3.36)
Substituting Equation (A3.36) into Equation (A3.30) yields the familiar form of the HRR singularity:
(A3.37)
since  eo = so /E. The integration constant is plotted in Figure 3.10 for both plane stress and plane
strain, while Figure 3.11 shows the angular variation of  for n = 3 and n = 13.
Rice and Rosengren [8] obtained essentially identical results to Hutchinson (for plane strain),
although they approached the problem in a somewhat different manner. Rice and Rosengren beganwith a heuristic argument for the  1/r variation of strain energy density, and then introduced an Airy
stress function of the form of Equation (A3.29) with the exponent on r given by Equation (A3.31).
They computed stresses, strains, and displacements in the vicinity of the crack tip by applying theappropriate boundary conditions.
The HRR singularity was an important result because it established  J as a stress amplitude
parameter within the plastic zone, where the linear elastic solution is invalid. The analyses ofHutchinson, Rice, and Rosengren demonstrated that the stresses in the plastic zone are much higherin plane strain than in plane stress. This is consistent with the simplistic analysis in Section 2.10.1.
One must bear in mind the limitations of the HRR solution. Since the singularity is merely
the leading term in an asymptotic expansion, and elastic strains are assumed to be negligible, thissolution dominates only near the crack tip, well within the plastic zone. For very small r values,
however, the HRR solution is invalid because it neglects ﬁnite geometry changes at the crack tip.When the HRR singularity dominates, the loading is proportional, which implies a single-parameterdescription of crack-tip ﬁelds. When the higher-order terms in the series are signiﬁcant, theloading is often nonproportional and a single-parameter description may no longer be possible(see Section 3.6).
A3.5 A NALYSIS  OF STABLE CRACK GROWTH  
IN   SMALL-SCALE YIELDING
A3.5.1 The Rice-Drugan-Sham Analysis
Rice, Drugan, and Sham (RDS) [15] performed an asymptotic analysis of a growing crack in anelastic-plastic solid in small-scale yielding. They assumed crack extension at a constant crack-opening angle, and predicted the shape of  J resistance curves. They also speculated about the effect
of large-scale yielding on the crack growth resistance behavior.() ()ns+− + =12 1 0

Small-Scale Yielding
Rice et al. analyzed the local stresses and displacements at a growing crack by modifying the
classical Prandtl slip-line ﬁeld to account for elastic unloading behind the crack tip. They assumedsmall-scale yielding conditions and a nonhardening material; the details of the derivation are omittedfor brevity. The RDS crack growth analysis resulted in the following expression:
(A3.38)
where 
 = rate of crack-opening displacement at a distance R behind the crack tip
 = rate of change in the  J integral
 = crack-growth rate
a, b, and R = constants
9 
The asymptotic analysis indicated that b = 5.083 for n  = 0.3 and b  = 4.385 for n  = 0.5. The
other constants, a and R, could not be inferred from the asymptotic analysis. Rice et al. [15]
performed an elastic-plastic ﬁnite element analysis of a growing crack and found that R, which has
units of length, scales approximately with the plastic zone size, and can be estimated by
 where l ≈ 0.2 (A3.39)
The dimensionless constant α can be estimated by considering a stationary crack (  = 0):
(A3.40)
Referring to Equation (3.48), a obviously equals dn when d  is deﬁned by the 90 ° intercept method.
The ﬁnite element analysis performed by Rice et al. indicated that a for a growing crack is nearly
equal to the stationary crack case.
Rice et al. performed an asymptotic integration of (Equation (A3.38)) for the case where the
crack length increases continuously with  J, which led to
(A3.41)
where d, in this case, is the crack-opening displacement at a distance r from the crack tip, and
e (= 2.718) is the natural logarithm base. Equation (A3.41) can be rearranged to solve for the nondi-
mensional tearing modulus:
(A3.42)

relationship (Equation (3.22)), for which the same symbol is used.˙˙˙ln δασβσ=+

164 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Rice et al. proposed a failure criterion that corresponds approximately to crack extension at a
constant crack-tip-opening angle (CTOA). Since dd/dr = ∞ at the crack tip, CTOA is undeﬁned,
but an approximate CTOA can be inferred a ﬁnite distance from the tip. Figure A3.6 illustrates the
RDS crack-growth criterion. They postulated that crack growth occurs at a critical crack-openingdisplacement d
c at a distance rm behind the crack tip. That is
(A3.43)
Rice et al. found that it was possible to deﬁne the micromechanical failure parameters δc and rm
in terms of global parameters that are easy to obtain experimentally. Setting  J = JIc and combining
Equation (A3.39), Equation (A3.42), and Equation (A3.43) gives
(A3.44)
where To is the initial tearing modulus. Thus for  J > JIc, the tearing modulus is given by
(A3.45)
Rice et al. computed normalized R curves ( J/JIc vs. ∆a/R) for a range of To values and found that
T = To in the early stages of crack growth, but the R curve slope decreases until the steady-state
plateau is reached. The steady-state  J can easily be inferred from Equation (A3.45) by setting T = 0:
(A3.46)
Large-Scale Yielding
Although the RDS analysis was derived for small-scale yielding conditions, Rice et al. speculated
that the form of Equation (A3.38) might also be valid for fully plastic conditions. The numericalvalues of some of the constants, however, probably differ for the large-scale yielding case.
The most important difference between small-scale yielding and fully plastic conditions is the
value of R. Rice et al. argued that R would no longer scale with the plastic zone size, but shouldFIGURE A3.6 The RDS crack growth criterion. The
crack is assumed to extend with a constant opening
displacement δc at distance rm behind the crack tip. This
criterion corresponds approximately to crack extensionat a constant crack-tip-opening angle (CTOA).

be proportional to the ligament length. They made a rough estimate of R ~ b /4 for the fully plastic
case.
The constant a depends on crack-tip triaxiality and thus may differ for small-scale yielding
and fully yielded conditions. For highly constrained conﬁgurations, such as bend specimens, a for
the two cases should be similar.
In small-scale yielding, the deﬁnition of  J is unambiguous, since it is related to the elastic stress
intensity factor. The  J integral for a growing crack under fully plastic conditions can be computed
in a number of ways, however, and not all deﬁnitions of  J are appropriate in the large-scale yielding
version of Equation (A3.38).
Assume that the crack-growth resistance behavior is to be characterized by a J-like parameter
Jx. Assuming Jx depends on the crack length and displacement, the rate of change in  Jx should be
linearly related to the displacement rate and :
(A3.47)
where x and c  are functions of displacement and crack length. Substituting Equation (A3.47) into
Equation (A3.38) gives
(A3.48)
In the limit of a rigid ideally plastic material, so/E = 0. Also, the local crack-opening rate must be
proportional to the global displacement rate for a rigid ideally plastic material:
(A3.49)
Therefore, the term in square brackets in Equation (A3.48) must vanish, which implies that c = 0,
at least in the limit of a rigid ideally plastic material. Thus, in order for the RDS model to apply
to large-scale yielding, the rate of change in the J-like parameter must not depend on the crack-
growth rate:
(A3.50)
Rice et al. showed that neither the deformation theory  J nor the far-ﬁeld  J satisfy Equation (A3.50)
for all conﬁgurations.
Satisfying Equation (A3.50) does not necessarily imply that a  Jx-R curve is geometry indepen-
dent. The RDS model suggests that a resistance curve obtained from a fully yielded specimen willnot, in general, agree with the small-scale yielding R curve for the same material. Assuming R = b/4
for the fully plastic case, the RDS model predicts the following tearing modulus:
(A3.51)
where the subscripts ssy and fy denote small-scale yielding and fully yielded conditions, respec-
tively. According to Equation (A3.51), the crack-growth-resistance curve under fully yieldedconditions has a constant initial slope, but this slope is not equal to T

in small-scale yielding) unless  afy = assy and b = 4l EJIc/so2. Equation (A3.51) does not predict a
steady-state limit where T = 0; rather this relationship predicts that T actually increases as the
ligament becomes smaller.
The foregoing analysis implies that crack-growth-resistance curves obtained from specimens
with fully yielded ligaments are suspect. One should exercise extreme caution when applying
experimental results from small specimens to predict the behavior of large structures.
A3.5.2 Steady State Crack Growth
The RDS analysis, which assumed a local failure criterion based on crack-opening angle, indicated
that crack growth in small-scale yielding reaches a steady state, where dJ/da → 0. The derivation
that follows shows that the steady-state limit is a general result for small-scale yielding; the R curve
must eventually reach a plateau in an inﬁnite body, regardless of the failure mechanism.
Generalized Damage Integral
Consider a material element a small distance from a crack tip, as illustrated in Figure A3.7. This
material element will fail when it is deformed beyond its capacity. The crack will grow as consecutivematerial elements at the tip fail. Let us deﬁne a generalized damage integral Θ, which characterizes
the severity of loading at the crack tip:
(A3.52)
where e
eq is the equivalent (von Mises) plastic strain and Ω is a function of the stress and strain
tensors ( sij and eij, respectively). The above integral is sufﬁciently general that it can depend on the
current values of all stress and strain components, as well as the entire deformation history. Referringto Figure A3.7, the material element will fail at a critical value of Θ. At the moment of crack initiation
or during crack extension, the material near the crack tip will be close to the point of failure. At adistance r* from the crack tip, where r* is arbitrarily small, we can assume that Θ = Θ
c.
The precise form of the damage integral depends on the micromechanism of fracture. For
example, a modiﬁed Rice and Tracey [47] model for ductile hole growth (see Chapter 5) can beused to characterize ductile fracture in metals:

where
R = void radius
Ro = initial radius
sm = mean (hydrostatic) stress
se = effective (von Mises) stress
Failure, in this case, is assumed when the void radius reaches a critical value.
Stable Crack Growth
Consider an inﬁnite body10 that contains a crack that is growing in a stable, self-similar, and
quasistatic manner. If the crack has grown well beyond the initial blunted tip, dimensional analysis
indicates that the local stresses and strains are uniquely characterized by the far-ﬁeld J integral, as
stated in Equation (3.69). In light of this single-parameter condition, the integrand of Equation(A3.52) becomes
(A3.54)
We can restrict this analysis to q = 0 by assuming that the material on the crack plane fails during
Mode I crack growth. For a given material point on the crack plane, r decreases as the crack grows,
and the plastic strain increases. If strain increases monotonically as this material point approachesthe crack tip, Equation (A3.54) permits writing Ω as a function of the von Mises strain:
(A3.55)
Therefore the local failure criterion is given by
(A3.56)
where e* is the critical strain (i.e., the von Mises strain at r = r*). Since the integrand is a function
only of e
eq, the integration path is the same for all material points ahead of the crack tip, and e*
is constant during crack growth. That is, the equivalent plastic strain at r* will always equal e*
when the crack is growing. Based on Equation (3.69) and Equation (A3.54), e* is a function only
of r* and the applied J:
(A3.57)
Solving for the differential of e* gives
(A3.58)
Since e* and r* are both ﬁxed, de* = dr* = dJ = 0. 
10 In practical terms ‘‘inﬁnite’’ means that external boundaries are sufﬁciently far from the crack tip so that the plastic zone
is embedded within an elastic singularity zone.ΩΩ=

Thus the J integral remains constant during crack extension ( dJ/da = 0) when Equation (3.69)
is satisﬁed. Steady-state crack growth is usually not observed experimentally because large-scale
yielding in ﬁnite-sized specimens precludes characterizing a growing crack with  J. Also, a signif-
icant amount of crack growth may be required before a steady state is reached (Figure 3.25); thecrack tip in a typical laboratory specimen approaches a free boundary well before the crack growthis sufﬁcient to be unaffected by the initial blunted tip.
A3.6 N OTES ON THE APPLICABILITY  OF DEFORMATION  PLASTICITY
TO CRACK PROBLEMS
Since elastic-plastic fracture mechanics is based on the deformation plasticity theory, it may beinstructive to take a closer look at this theory and assess its validity for crack problems.
Let us begin with the plastic portion of the Ramberg-Osgood equation for uniaxial deformation,
which can be expressed in the following form:
(A3.59)
Differentiating Equation (A3.59) gives
(A3.60)
for an increment of plastic strain. For the remainder of this section, the subscript on strain issuppressed for brevity; only plastic strains are considered, unless stated otherwise.
Equation (A3.59) and Equation (A3.60) represent the deformation and incremental ﬂow theo-
ries, respectively, for uniaxial deformation in a Ramberg-Osgood material. In this simple case, thereis no difference between the incremental and deformation theories, provided no unloading occurs.Equation (A3.60) can obviously be integrated to obtain Equation (A3.59). Stress is uniquely relatedto strain when both increase monotonically. It does not necessarily follow that deformation andincremental theories are equivalent in the case of three-dimensional monotonic loading, but thereare many cases where this is a good assumption.
Equation (A3.59) can be generalized to three dimensions by assuming deformation plasticity
and isotropic hardening:
(A3.61)
where s
e is the effective (von Mises) stress and Sij is the deviatoric component of the stress tensor,
deﬁned by
(A3.62)
where dij is the Kronecker delta. Equation (A3.61) is the deformation theory ﬂow rule  for a Ramberg-
Osgood material. The corresponding ﬂow rule for incremental plasticity theory is given by

Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics 169
By comparing Equation (A3.61) and Equation (A3.63), one sees that the deformation and incre-
mental theories of plasticity coincide only if the latter equation can be integrated to obtain theformer. If the deviatoric stress components are proportional to the effective stress:
(A3.64)
where w
ij is a constant tensor that does not depend on strain, then the integration of Equation
(A3.63) results in Equation (A3.61). Thus deformation and incremental theories of plasticity areidentical when the loading is proportional in the deviatoric stresses. Note that the total stress
components need not be proportional in order for the two theories to coincide; the ﬂow rule is notinﬂuenced by the hydrostatic portion of the stress tensor.
Proportional loading of the deviatoric components does not necessarily mean that deformation
plasticity theory is rigorously correct; it merely implies that the deformation theory is no more objec-tionable than the incremental theory. Classical plasticity theory, whether based on incremental strain ortotal deformation, contains simplifying assumptions about material behavior. Both Equation (A3.61)and Equation (A3.63) assume that the yield surface expands symmetrically and that its radius doesnot depend on hydrostatic stress. For monotonic loading ahead of a crack in a metal, theseassumptions are probably reasonable; the assumed hardening law is of little consequence formonotonic loading, and hydrostatic stress effects on the yield surface are relatively small for mostmetals.
Budiansky [48] showed that the deformation theory is still acceptable when there are modest
deviations from proportionality. Low work-hardening materials are the least sensitive to nonpro-portional loading.
Since most of classical fracture mechanics assumes either plane stress or plane strain, it is
useful to examine plastic deformation in the two-dimensional case, and determine under whatconditions the requirement of proportional deviatoric stresses is at least approximately satisﬁed.Consider, for example, plane strain. When elastic strains are negligible, the in-plane deviatoricnormal stresses are given by
and (A3.65)
assuming incompressible plastic deformation, where s
zz = (sxx + syy)/2. The expression for von
Mises stress in plane strain reduces to
(A3.66)      
where Sxy = txy. Alternatively, se can be written in terms of principal normal stresses:
where s1 > s2
(A3.67)
      
Therefore, the principal deviatoric stresses are proportional to se in the case of plane strain. It can
easily be shown that the same is true for plane stress. If the principal axes are ﬁxed, Sxx, Syy, andSij ij e=ωσ

170 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Sxy must also be proportional to se. If, however, the principal axes rotate during deformation, the
deviatoric stress components deﬁned by a ﬁxed coordinate system will not increase in proportion
to one another.
 In the case of Mode I loading of a crack, txy is always zero on the crack plane, implying
that the principal directions on the crack plane are always parallel to the x-y-z coordinate axes.
Thus, the deformation and incremental plasticity theories should be equally valid on the crackplane, well inside the plastic zone (where elastic strains are negligible). At ﬁnite angles fromthe crack plane, the principal axes may rotate with deformation, which will produce nonpro-portional deviatoric stresses. If this effect is small, the deformation plasticity theory shouldbe adequate to analyze stresses and strains near the crack tip in either plane stress or planestrain.
The validity of the deformation plasticity theory does not automatically guarantee that the
crack-tip conditions can be characterized by a single parameter, such as  J or K. Single-parameter
fracture mechanics requires that the total stress components be proportional near the crack tip,
11 a
much more severe restriction. Proportional total stresses imply that the deviatoric stresses areproportional, but the reverse is not necessarily true. In both the linear elastic case (Appendix 2.3)and the nonlinear case (Appendix 3.4) the stresses near the crack tip were derived from a stressfunction of the form
(A3.68)      
where k is a constant. The form of Equation (A3.68) guarantees that all stress components
are proportional to k, and thus proportional to one another. Therefore any monotonic function
of k uniquely characterizes the stress ﬁelds in the region where Equation (A3.68) is valid.
Nonproportional loading automatically invalidates Equation (A3.68) and the single-parameterdescription that it implies.
As stated earlier, the deviatoric stresses are proportional on the crack plane, well within the
plastic zone. However, the hydrostatic stress may not be proportional to s
e. For example, the loading
is highly nonproportional in the large-strain region, as Figure 3.12 indicates. Consider a materialpoint at a distance x from the crack tip, where x is in the current large-strain region. At earlier
stages of deformation the loading on this point was proportional, but s
yy reached a peak when the
ratio x so/J was approximately unity, and the normal stress decreased with subsequent deformation.
Thus, the most recent loading on this point was nonproportional, but the deviatoric stresses arestill proportional to s
e.
When the crack grows, the material behind the crack tip unloads elastically and the defor-
mation plasticity theory is no longer valid. The deformation theory is also suspect near the elastic-plastic boundary. Equation (A3.65) to Equation (A3.67) were derived assuming the elastic strainswere negligible, which implies s
zz = 0.5(sxx + syy) in plane strain. At the onset of yielding,
however, szz = n (sxx + syy), and the proportionality constants between se and the deviatoric
stress components are different than for the fully plastic case. Thus when elastic and plasticstrains are of comparable magnitude, the deviatoric stresses are nonproportional, as w
ij (Equation
(A3.64)) varies from its elastic value to the fully plastic limit. The errors in the deformationtheory that may arise from the transition from elastic to plastic behavior should not be appreciablein crack problems, because the strain gradient ahead of the crack tip is relatively steep, and thetransition zone is small.
11 The proportional loading region need not extend all the way to the crack tip, but the nonproportional zone at the tip
must be embedded within the proportional zone in order for a single loading parameter to characterize crack-tip
conditions.Φ=κθrfs()1656_C003.fm  Page 170  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:42 PM

Dynamic and 
Time-Dependent Fracture 
In certain fracture problems, time is an important variable. At high loading rates, for example,
inertia effects and material rate dependence can be signiﬁcant. Metals and ceramics also exhibitrate-dependent deformation (creep) at temperatures that are close to the melting point of thematerial. The mechanical behavior of polymers is highly sensitive to strain rate, particularly abovethe glass transition temperature. In each of these cases, linear elastic and elastic-plastic fracturemechanics, which assume quasistatic, rate-independent deformation, are inadequate.
Early fracture mechanics researchers considered dynamic effects, but only for the special case
of linear elastic material behavior. More recently, fracture mechanics has been extended to includetime-dependent material behavior such as viscoplasticity and viscoelasticity. Most of these newerapproaches are based on generalizations of the 
 J 
 contour integral.
This chapter gives an overview of time-dependent fracture mechanics. The treatment of this subject
is far from exhaustive, but should serve as an introduction to a complex and rapidly developing ﬁeld.
The reader is encouraged to consult the published literature for a further background. 
4.1 DYNAMIC FRACTURE AND CRACK ARREST 
As any undergraduate engineering student knows, dynamics is more dif ﬁcult than statics. Problems
become more complicated when the equations of equilibrium are replaced by the equations of motion.
In the most general case, dynamic fracture mechanics contains three complicating features that are
not present in LEFM and elastic-plastic fracture mechanics: inertia forces, rate-dependent materialbehavior, and reﬂ ected stress waves. Inertia effects are important when the load changes abruptly or
the crack grows rapidly; a portion of the work that is applied to the specimen is converted to kineticenergy. Most metals are not sensitive to moderate variations in strain rate near ambient temperature,but the ﬂ ow stress can increase appreciably when the strain rate increases by several orders of magni-
tude. The effect of rapid loading is even more pronounced in rate-sensitive materials such as polymers.When the load changes abruptly or the crack grows rapidly, stress waves propagate through the materialand reﬂ ect off free surfaces, such as the specimen boundaries and the crack plane. Re ﬂecting stress
waves inﬂ uence the local crack-tip stress and strain ﬁ elds which, in turn, affect the fracture behavior.
In certain problems, one or more of the above effects can be ignored. If all three effects are
neglected, the problem reduces to the quasistatic case.
The dynamic version of LEFM is termed  
elastodynamic fracture mechanics 
, where nonlinear
material behavior is neglected, but inertia forces and reﬂected stress waves are incorporated whennecessary. The theoretical framework of elastodynamic fracture mechanics is fairly well established,and practical applications of this approach are becoming more common. Extensive reviews of thissubject have been published by Freund [1 –5], Kanninen and Poplar [6], Rose [7], and others. Elas-
todynamic fracture mechanics has limitations, but is approximately valid in many cases. When theplastic zone is restricted to a small region near the crack tip in a dynamic problem, the stress-intensity approach, with some modiﬁcations, is still applicable.
Dynamic fracture analyses that incorporate nonlinear, time-dependent material behavior are a
relatively recent innovation. A number of researchers have generalized the 
 J 
 integral to account for
inertia and viscoplasticity [8–13].4

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
There are two major classes of dynamic fracture problems: (1) fracture initiation as a result of
rapid loading, and (2) rapid propagation of a crack. In the latter case, the crack propagation may initiate
either by quasistatic or rapid application of a load; the crack may arrest after some amount of unstablepropagation. Dynamic initiation, propagation, and crack arrest are discussed later in this chapter.

Rapid loading of a structure can come from a number of sources, but most often occurs as theresult of impact with a second object (e.g., a ship colliding with an offshore platform or a missilestriking its target). Impact loading is often applied in laboratory tests when a high strain rate isdesired. The Charpy test [14], where a pendulum dropped from a ﬁxed height fractures a notchedspecimen, is probably the most common dynamic mechanical test. Dynamic loading of a fracturemechanics specimen can be achieved through impact loading [15, 16], a controlled explosion nearthe specimen [17], or servo-hydraulic testing machines that are specially designed to impart highdisplacement rates. Chapter 7 describes some of the practical aspects of high rate fracture testing.
Figure 4.1 schematically illustrates a typical load-time response for dynamic loading. The load
tends to increase with time, but oscillates at a particular frequency that depends on specimen geometryand material properties. Note that the loading rate is ﬁnite, i.e., a ﬁnite time is required to reach aparticular load. The amplitude of the oscillations decreases with time, as kinetic energy is dissipatedby the specimen. Thus, inertia effects are most signiﬁcant at short times, and are minimal aftersufﬁciently long times, where the behavior is essentially quasistatic.
Determining a fracture characterizing parameter, such as the stress-intensity factor or the 
 J 
integral, for rapid loading can be very dif ﬁcult. Consider the case where the plastic zone is conﬁned
to a small region surrounding the crack tip. The near-tip stress ﬁelds for high rate Mode I loading
are given by Equation 4.1.
(4.1)
where ( 
t 
) denotes a function of time. The angular functions  
f 
ij 
 are identical to the quasistatic case
and are given in Table 2.1. The stress-intensity factor, which characterizes the amplitude of theelastic singularity, varies erratically in the early stages of loading. Re ﬂecting stress waves that pass
through the specimen constructively and destructively interfere with one another, resulting in ahighly complex time-dependent stress distribution. The instantaneous  
K 
I 
  
depends on the magnitude
of the discrete stress waves that pass through the crack-tip region at that particular moment in time.When the discrete waves are signiﬁcant, it is not possible to infer  
K 
I 
 from the remote loads.

Dynamic and Time-Dependent F racture 
175 
Recent work by Nakamura et al. [18, 19] quantiﬁ ed inertia effects in laboratory specimens and
showed that these effects can be neglected in many cases. They observed that the behavior of a
dynamically loaded specimen can be characterized by a short-time response, dominated by discretewaves, and a long-time response that is essentially quasistatic. At intermediate times, global inertiaeffects are signiﬁ cant but local oscillations at the crack are small, because kinetic energy is absorbed
by the plastic zone. To distinguish short-time response from long-time response, Nakamura et al. de ﬁned
a  
transition time 
  
t 
τ 
 when the kinetic energy and the deformation energy (the energy absorbed by the
specimen) are equal. Inertia effects dominate prior to the transition time, but the deformation energydominates at times signiﬁ cantly greater than  
t 
τ 
. In the latter case, a 
 J 
-dominated ﬁeld should exist near
the crack tip and quasistatic relationships can be used to infer 
 J 
 from global load and displacement.
Since it is not possible to measure kinetic and deformation energies separately during a fracture
mechanics experiment, Nakamura et al. developed a simple model to estimate the kinetic energyand the transition time in a three-point bend specimen (Figure 4.2). This model was based on theBernoulli-Euler beam theory and assumed that the kinetic energy at early times was dominated bythe elastic response of the specimen. Incorporating the known relationship between the load-linedisplacement and the strain energy in a three-point bend specimen leads to an approximate rela-tionship for the ratio of kinetic to deformation energy:

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
The advantage of Equation (4.2) is that the displacement and displacement rate can be measured
experimentally. The transition time is de ﬁned at the moment in the test when the ratio

U 
  
=

order to obtain an explicit expression for  
t

(4.5)
Nakamura et al. [18, 19] performed a dynamic ﬁnite element analysis on a three-point bend
specimen in order to evaluate the accuracy of Equation (4.2) and Equation (4.5). Figure 4.3 compares
the  
E 
k 
/ 
U 
 ratio computed from a ﬁnite element analysis with that determined from the experiment
and Equation (4.2). The horizontal axis is a dimensionless time scale, and  
c 
1 
 is the longitudinal
wave speed in an unbounded solid. The ratio 
 W 
/ 
c 
1 
is an estimate of the time required for a stress
wave to traverse the width of the specimen. Based on Equation (4.2) and the experiment,  
t

(or

t

W 
  
≈ 
 27. Thus the simple model
agrees quite well with a more detailed analysis.
The simple model was based on the global kinetic energy and did not consider discrete stress
waves. Thus the model is only valid after stress waves have traversed the width of the specimenseveral times. This limitation does not affect the analysis of the transition time, since stress waveshave made approximately 27 passes when  
t 
τ 
 is reached. Note, in Figure 4.3, that the simple model
agrees very well with the ﬁnite element analysis when

analysis on a three-point bend specimen in order to determine the range of applicability of
Equation (4.6). They evaluated a dynamic 
 J 
 integral (see Section 4.1.3) at various thickness positions
and observed a through-thickness variation of 
 J 
 that is similar to Figure 3.36. They computed a
nominal 
 J 
 that averaged the through-thickness variations and compared this value with 
 J 
dc 
. 
 The
results of this exercise are plotted in Figure 4.4. At short times, the average dynamic 
 J 
 is signiﬁcantly
lower than the 
 J computed from the quasistatic relationship. For t > 2tτ, the Jdc/Jave reaches a
constant value that is slightly greater than 1. The modest discrepancy between  Jdc and Jave at long
times is probably due to three-dimensional effects rather than dynamic effects (Equation (4.6) isessentially a two-dimensional formula).

178 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
According to Figure 4.4, Equation (4.6) provides a good estimate of  J in a high-rate test at
times greater than approximately twice the transition time. It follows that if the fracture initiation
occurs after 2 tτ, the critical value of  J obtained from Equation (4.6) is a measure of the fracture
toughness for high-rate loading. If small-scale yielding assumptions apply, the critical  J can be
converted to an equivalent KIc through Equation (3.18).
Given the dif ﬁculties associated with deﬁning a fracture parameter in the presence of inertia
forces and reﬂected stress waves, it is obviously preferable to apply Equation (4.6) wheneverpossible. For a three-point bend specimen with  W = 50 mm, the transition time is approximately
300 µs [19]. Thus the quasistatic formula can be applied as long as fracture occurs after ~600 µs.
This requirement is relatively easy to meet in impact tests on ductile materials [15, 16]. For morebrittle materials, the transition-time requirement can be met by decreasing the displacement rateor the width of the specimen.
The transition-time concept can be applied to other con ﬁgurations by adjusting the geometry
factor in Equation (4.2). Duffy and Shih [17] have applied this approach to dynamic fracturetoughness measurement in notched round bars. Small round bars have proved to be suitablefor the dynamic testing of brittle materials such as ceramics, where the transition time mustbe small.
If the effects of inertia and reﬂ ected stress waves can be eliminated, one is left with the rate-
dependent material response. The transition-time approach allows material rate effects to be quanti ﬁed
independent of inertia effects. High strain rates tend to elevate the ﬂow stress of the material. The
effect of ﬂow stress on fracture toughness depends on the failure mechanism. High strain rates tendto decrease cleavage resistance, which is stress controlled. Materials whose fracture mechanismsare strain controlled often see an increase in toughness at high loading rates because more energyis required to reach a given strain value.
Figure 4.5 shows the fracture toughness data for a structural steel at three loading rates [21].
The critical K
I values were determined from quasistatic relationships. For a given loading rate, the
fracture toughness increases rapidly with temperature at the onset of the ductile-brittle transition.Note that increasing the loading rate has the effect of shifting the transition to higher temperatures.Thus, at a constant temperature, fracture toughness is highly sensitive to strain rate.
The effect of the loading rate on the fracture behavior of a structural steel on the upper shelf
of toughness is illustrated in Figure 4.6. In this instance, the strain rate has the opposite effect fromFigure 4.5, because ductile fracture of metals is primarily strain controlled. The  J integral at a given
amount of crack extension is elevated by high strain rates.
4.1.2 R APID CRACK PROPAGATION  AND ARREST
When the driving force for crack extension exceeds the material resistance, the structure is unstable,and rapid crack propagation occurs. Figure 4.7 illustrates a simple case, where the (quasistatic)energy release rate increases linearly with the crack length and the material resistance is constant.Since the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics must be obeyed even by an unstable system, the excessenergy, denoted by the shaded area in Figure 4.7, does not simply disappear, but is converted intokinetic energy. The magnitude of the kinetic energy dictates the crack speed.
In the quasistatic case, a crack is stable if the driving force is less than or equal to the material
resistance. Similarly, if the energy available for an incremental extension of a rapidly propagatingcrack falls below the material resistance, the crack arrests. Figure 4.8 illustrates a simpli ﬁed scenario
for crack arrest. Suppose that cleavage fracture initiates when K
I = KIc. The resistance encountered
by a rapidly propagating cleavage crack is less than for cleavage initiation, because plasticdeformation at the moving crack tip is suppressed by the high local strain rates. If the structurehas a falling driving force curve, it eventually crosses the resistance curve. Arrest does not occur atthis point, however, because the structure contains kinetic energy that can be converted to fracture1656_C004.fm  Page 178  Thursday, April 21, 2005  5:38 PM

energy. Arrest occurs below the resistance curve, after most of the available energy has been dissipated.
The apparent arrest toughness KIa is less than the true material resistance KIA. The difference between
KIa and KIA is governed by the kinetic energy created during crack propagation; KIA is a material
property, but KIa depends on geometry.FIGURE 4.5 Effect of loading rate on the cleavage fracture toughness of a structural steel. Taken from Barsom,

180 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8 compare material resistance with quasistatic  driving force curves.
That is, these curves represent  KI and G values computed with the procedures described in Chapter 2.
Early researchers [22–26] realized that the crack-driving force should incorporate the effect of
kinetic energy. The Grif ﬁth-Irwin energy balance (Section 2.3 and Section 2.4) can be modiﬁed to
include kinetic energy, resulting in a dynamic de ﬁnition of the energy release rate:
(4.7)
where F is the work done by external forces and A is the crack area. Equation (4.7) is consistent
with the original Grif ﬁth approach, which is based on the ﬁ rst law of thermodynamics. The
kinetic energy must be included in a general statement of the ﬁ rst law; Grif ﬁth implicitly assumed
that Ek = 0.
4.1.2.1 Crac k Speed
Mott [22] applied dimensional analysis to a propagating crack in order to estimate the relationshipbetween kinetic energy and crack speed. For a through crack of length 2 a in an inﬁnite plate in
tension, the displacements must be proportional to the crack size, since a is the only relevant lengthFIGURE 4.7 Unstable crack propagation, which results
in the generation of kinetic energy.

tance KIA due to excess kinetic energy.

dimension. Assuming the plate is elastic, the displacements must also be proportional to the nominal
applied strain; thus 
and (4.8)
where αx and αy are dimensionless constants. (Note that quantitative estimates for αx and αy near
the crack tip in the quasistatic case can be obtained by applying the relationships in Table 2.2.)The kinetic energy is equal to half the mass times the velocity squared. Therefore, E
k for the cracked
plate (assuming a unit thickness) is given by
(4.9)
where ρ is the mass density of the material and V( ) is the crack speed. Assuming the integrand
depends only on position,1 Ek can be written in the following form:
(4.10)
where k is a constant. Applying the modiﬁed Grif ﬁth energy balance (Equation (4.7)) gives
(4.11)
where wf is the work of fracture, deﬁ ned in Chapter 2; in the limit of an ideally brittle material,
wf = γs, the surface energy. Note that Equation (4.11) assumes a ﬂat R curve (constant wf). At
initiation, the kinetic energy term is not present, and the initial crack length ao can be inferred
from Equation (2.22):
(4.12)
Substituting Equation (4.12) into Equation (4.11) and solving for V leads to
(4.13)
where co = , the speed of sound for one-dimensional wave propagation. Mott [22] actually
obtained a somewhat different relationship from Equation (4.13), because he solved Equation (4.11)by making the erroneous assumption that dV/da = 0. Dulaney and Brace [27] and Berry [28] later
corrected the Mott analysis and derived Equation (4.13).
Roberts and Wells [29] obtained an estimate for k by applying the Westergaard stress
function (Appendix 2.3) for this conﬁ guration. After making a few assumptions, they showed that
 ≈ 0.38.

182 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
According to Equation (4.13) and the Roberts and Wells analysis, the crack speed reaches a
limiting value of 0.38 co when a >> ao. This estimate compares favorably with measured crack speeds
in metals, which typically range from 0.2 to 0.4 co [30].
Freund [2–4] performed a more detailed numerical analysis of a dynamically propagating crack
in an inﬁnite body and obtained the following relationship:
(4.14)
where cr is the Raleigh (surface) wave speed. For Poisson’ s ratio = 0.3, the cr/co ratio = 0.57. Thus
the Freund analysis predicts a larger limiting crack speed than the Roberts and Wells analysis. The
limiting crack speed in Equation (4.14) can be argued on physical grounds [26]. For the specialcase where w
f = 0, a propagating crack is merely a disturbance on a free surface that must move
at the Raleigh wave velocity. In both Equation (4.13) and Equation (4.14), the limiting velocity isindependent of the fracture energy; thus the maximum crack speed should be c
r for all wf.
Experimentally observed crack speeds do not usually reach cr. Both the simple analysis that
resulted in Equation (4.13) and Freund’ s more detailed dynamic analysis assumed that the fracture
energy does not depend on crack length or crack speed. The material resistance actually increaseswith crack speed, as discussed below. The good agreement between experimental crack velocitiesand the Roberts and Wells estimate of 0.38 c
o is largely coincidental.
4.1.2.2 Elastodynamic Crack-Tip Parameters
The governing equation for Mode I crack propagation under elastodynamic conditions can be
written as
(4.15)
where KI is the instantaneous stress intensity and KID is the material resistance to crack propagation,
which depends on the crack velocity. In general, KI(t) is not equal to the static stress-intensity
factor, as deﬁned in Chapter 2. A number of researchers [8 –10, 31–33] have obtained a relationship
for the dynamic stress intensity of the form
(4.16)
where k is a universal function of crack speed and KI(0) is the static stress-intensity factor. The
function k(V) = 1.0 when V = 0, and decreases to zero as V approaches the Raleigh wave velocity.
An approximate expression for k was obtained by Rose [34]:
(4.17)
where h is a function of the elastic wave speeds and can be approximated by
(4.18)
where c1 and c2 are the longitudinal and shear wave speeds, respectively.Vca

Equation (4.16) is valid only at short times or in inﬁnite bodies. This relationship neglects
reﬂected stress waves, which can have a signi ﬁcant effect on the local crack-tip ﬁelds. Since the
crack speed is proportional to the wave speed, Equation (4.16) is valid as long as the length of
crack propagation ( a − ao) is small compared to the specimen dimensions, because reﬂecting stress
waves will not have had time to reach the crack tip (Example 4.1). In ﬁnite specimens where stress
waves reﬂect back to the propagating crack tip, the dynamic stress intensity must be determinedexperimentally or numerically on a case-by-case basis.
EXAMPLE 4.1
Rapid crack propagation initiates in a deeply notched specimen with an initial ligament bo (Figure 4.9).
Assuming the average crack speed = 0.2 c1, estimate how far the crack will propagate before it encounters
a reﬂ ected longitudinal wave.
Solution : At the moment the crack encounters the ﬁrst reﬂected wave, the crack has traveled a distance
∆a, while the wave has traveled 2 bo − ∆a. Equating the travel times gives
thus,
Equation (4.16) is valid in this case as long as the crack extension is less than  bo/3 and the plastic zone
is small compared to bo.
For an inﬁnite body or short times, Freund [10] showed that the dynamic energy release rate
could be expressed in the following form:
(4.19)
where g is a universal function of crack speed that can be approximated by

Combining Equation (4.16)–(4.20) with Equation (2.51) gives
(4.21)
where
(4.22)
Thus the relationship between KI and G depends on crack speed. A more accurate (and more
complicated) relationship for A(V) is given in Appendix 4.1.
When the plastic zone ahead of the propagating crack is small, KI(t) uniquely deﬁ nes the
crack-tip stress, strain, and displacement ﬁ elds, but the angular dependence of these quantities
is different from the quasistatic case. For example, the stresses in the elastic singularity zone are
given by [32, 33, 35]
(4.23)
The function fij reduces to the quasistatic case (Table 2.1) when V = 0. Appendix 4.1 outlines the
derivation of Equation (4.23) and gives speci ﬁc relationships for fij in the case of rapid crack
propagation. The displacement functions also display an angular dependence that varies with  V.
Consequently, αx and αy in Equation (4.9) must depend on crack velocity as well as position, and
the Mott analysis is not rigorously correct for dynamic crack propagation.
4.1.2.3Dynamic Toughness
As Equation (4.15) indicates, the dynamic stress intensity is equal to KID, the dynamic material
resistance, which depends on crack speed. This equality permits experimental measurements of KID.
Dynamic propagation toughness can be measured as a function of crack speed by means of
high-speed photography and optical methods, such as photoelasticity [36, 37] and the method of
caustics [38]. Figure 4.10 shows photoelastic fringe patterns for dynamic crack propagation inHomalite 100 [37]. Each fringe corresponds to a contour of maximum shear stress. Sanford andDally [36] describe procedures for inferring stress intensity from photoelastic patterns.

Figure 4.11 illustrates the typical variation of KID with crack speed. At low speeds, KID is
relatively insensitive to  V, but KID increases asymptotically as  V approaches a limiting value.
Figure 4.12 shows KID data for 4340 steel published by Rosakis and Freund [39].
In the limit of  V = 0, KID = KIA, the arrest toughness of the material. In general, KIA < KIc, the
quasistatic initiation toughness. When a stationary crack in an elastic-plastic material is loaded
monotonically, the crack-tip blunts and a plastic zone forms. A propagating crack, however, tendsto be sharper and has a smaller plastic zone than a stationary crack. Consequently, more energy isrequired to initiate fracture from a stationary crack than is required to maintain the propagation ofa sharp crack.
The crack-speed dependence of K
ID can be represented by an empirical equation of the form

where Vl is the limiting crack speed in the material and m is an experimentally determined constant.
As Figure 4.11(b) illustrates, KIA increases and  Vl decreases with increasing material toughness.
The trends in Figure 4.11(a) and Figure 4.11(b) have not only been observed experimentally, but
have also been obtained by numerical simulation [40, 41]. The upturn in propagation toughness athigh crack speeds is apparently caused by local inertia forces in the plastic zone.
4.1.2.4 Crack Arrest
Equation (4.15) deﬁnes the conditions for rapid crack advance. If, however, K
I(t) falls below the
minimum KID value for a ﬁnite length of time, propagation cannot continue, and the crack arrests.
There are a number of situations that might lead to crack arrest. Figure 4.8 illustrates one possibility:
If the driving force decreases with crack extension, it may eventually be less than the materialresistance. Arrest is also possible when the material resistance increases with crack extension. Forexample, a crack that initiates in a brittle region of a structure, such as a weld, may arrest when itreaches a material with higher toughness. A temperature gradient in a material that exhibits aductile-brittle transition is another case where the toughness can increase with position: A crackmay initiate in a cold region of the structure and arrest when it encounters warmer material witha higher toughness. An example of this latter scenario is a pressurized thermal shock event in anuclear pressure vessel [42]. 
In many instances, it is not possible to guarantee with absolute certainty that an unstable fracture
will not initiate in a structure. Transient loads, for example, may occur unexpectedly. In suchinstances crack arrest can be the second line of defense. Thus, the crack arrest toughness K
IA is an
important material property.
Based on Equation (4.16), one can argue that KI(t) at arrest is equivalent to the quasistatic
value, since  V = 0. Thus it should be possible to infer KIA from a quasistatic calculation based on
the load and crack length at arrest. This quasistatic approach to arrest is actually quite common,and is acceptable in many practical situations. Chapter 7 describes a standardized test method formeasuring crack-arrest toughness that is based on quasistatic assumptions.
However, the quasistatic arrest approach must be used with caution. Recall that Equation (4.16) is
valid only for inﬁ nite structures or short crack jumps, where reﬂ ected stress waves do not have suf ﬁcient
time to return to the crack tip. When reﬂ ected stress wave effects are signiﬁ cant, Equation (4.16) is no
longer valid, and a quasistatic analysis tends to give misleading estimates of the arrest toughness.Quasistatic estimates of arrest toughness are sometimes given the designation K
Ia; for short crack jumps
KIa = KIA.
The effect of stress waves on the apparent arrest toughness KIa was demonstrated dramatically
by Kalthoff et al. [43], who performed dynamic propagation and arrest experiments on wedge-loadeddouble cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. Recall from Example 2.3 that the DCB specimen exhibitsa falling driving-force curve in displacement control. Kalthoff et al. varied the K
I at initiation by
varying the notch-root radius. When the crack was sharp, fracture initiated slightly above KIA and
arrested after a short crack jump; the length of crack jump increased with the notch-tip radius.
Figure 4.13 is a plot of the Kalthoff et al. results. For the shortest crack jump, the true arrest
toughness and the apparent quasistatic value coincide, as expected. As the length of crack jumpincreases, the discrepancy between the true arrest and the quasistatic estimate increases, with K
IA > KIa.
Note that KIA appears to be a material constant but KIa varies with the length of crack propagation.
Also note that the dynamic stress intensity during crack growth is considerably different from thequasistatic estimate of K
I. Kobayashi et al. [44] obtained similar results.
A short time after arrest, the applied stress intensity reaches KIa, the quasistatic value.
Figure 4.14 shows the variation of KI after arrest in one of the Kalthoff et al. experiments. When
the crack arrests, KI = KIA, which is greater than KIa. Figure 4.14 shows that the specimen “ rings down”
to KIa after ~2000 µs. The quasistatic value, however, is not indicative of the true material-arrest
properties.1656_C004.fm  Page 186  Thursday, April 21, 2005  5:38 PM
Dynamic and Time-Dependent F racture 187
Recall the schematic in Figure 4.8, where it was argued that arrest, when quanti ﬁed by the
quasistatic stress intensity, would occur below the true arrest toughness KIA, because of the kinetic
energy in the specimen. This argument is a slight oversimpli ﬁcation, but it leads to the correct qualitative
conclusion.
The DCB specimen provides an extreme example of reﬂected stress wave effects; the specimen
design is such that stress waves can traverse the width of the specimen and return to the crack tip
in a very short time. In many structures, the quasistatic approach is approximately valid, even forrelatively long crack jumps. In any case, K
Ia gives a lower bound estimate of KIA, and thus is conservative
in most instances.FIGURE 4.13 Crack arrest experiments on wedge-loaded DCB Araldite B specimens. The statically inter-
preted arrest toughness underestimates the true KIA of the material; this effect is most pronounced for long

4.1.3 D YNAMIC  CONTOUR  INTEGRALS
The original formulation of the  J contour integral is equivalent to the nonlinear elastic energy release
rate for quasistatic deformation. By invoking a more general de ﬁnition of energy release rate, it is
possible to incorporate dynamic effects and time-dependent material behavior into the  J integral.
The energy release rate is usually deﬁned as the energy released from the body per unit crack
advance. A more precise de ﬁnition [11] involves the work input into the crack tip. Consider a
vanishingly small contour Γ around the tip of a crack in a two-dimensional solid (Figure 4.15).
The energy release rate is equal to the energy ﬂux into the crack tip, divided by the crack speed:

where F is the energy ﬂux into the area bounded by Γ. The generalized energy release rate, including
inertia effects, is given by
(4.26)
where w and T are the stress work and kinetic energy densities deﬁned as
(4.27)
and
(4.28)
Equation (4.26) has been published in a variety of forms by several researchers [8–12]. Appendix 4.2
gives a derivation of this relationship.
Equation (4.26) is valid for time-dependent as well as history-dependent material behavior.
When evaluating  J for a time-dependent material, it may be convenient to express w in the following
form:
(4.29)
where is the strain rate.
Unlike the conventional  J integral, the contour in Equation (4.26) cannot be chosen arbitrarily.
Consider, for example, a dynamically loaded cracked body with stress waves reﬂecting off freesurfaces. If the integral in Equation (4.26) were computed at two arbitrary contours a ﬁnite distance
from the crack tip and a stress wave passed through one contour but not the other, the values ofthese integrals would normally be different for the two contours. Thus, the generalized  J integral
is not path independent, except in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip. If, however, T = 0 at all
points in the body, the integrand in Equation (4.26) reduces to the form of the original  J integral.
In the latter case, the path-independent property of  J is restored if w displays the property of an
elastic potential (see Appendix 4.2).
The form of Equation (4.26) is not very convenient for numerical calculations, since it is
extremely dif ﬁcult to obtain adequate numerical precision from a contour integration very close to
the crack tip. Fortunately, Equation (4.26) can be expressed in a variety of other forms that aremore conducive to numerical analysis. The energy release rate can also be generalized to threedimensions. The results in Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4 are obtained from a ﬁnite element analysis
that utilized alternate forms of Equation (4.26). Chapter 12 discusses the numerical calculations ofJ for both quasistatic and dynamic loading.
4.2 CREEP CRA CK GROWTH
Components that operate at high temperatures relative to the melting point of the material may failby the slow and stable extension of a macroscopic crack. Traditional approaches to design in thecreep regime apply only when creep and material damage are uniformly distributed.

190 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Figure 4.16 illustrates the typical creep response of a material subject to constant stress.
Deformation at high temperatures can be divided into four regimes: instantaneous (elastic) strain,
primary creep, secondary (steady state) creep, and tertiary creep. The elastic strain occursimmediately upon application of the load. As discussed in the previous section on dynamicfracture, the elastic stress-strain response of a material is not instantaneous (i.e., it is limited bythe speed of sound in the material), but it can be viewed as such in creep problems, wherethe time scale is usually measured in hours. Primary creep dominates at short times after theapplication of the load; the strain rate decreases with time, as the material strain hardens. In thesecondary creep stage, the deformation reaches a steady state, where strain hardening and strainsoftening are balanced; the creep rate is constant in the secondary stage. In the tertiary stage,the creep rate accelerates, as the material approaches ultimate failure. Microscopic failure mech-anisms, such as grain boundary cavitation, nucleate in this ﬁ nal stage of creep.
During the growth of a macroscopic crack at high temperatures, all four types of creep response
can occur simultaneously in the most general case (Figure 4.17). The material at the tip of a growingcrack is in the tertiary stage of creep, since the material is obviously failing locally. The materialmay be elastic remote from the crack tip, and in the primary and secondary stages of creep atmoderate distances from the tip.FIGURE 4.16 Schematic creep behavior of a material subject to a constant stress.

Most analytical treatments of creep crack growth assume limiting cases, where one or more
of these regimes are not present or are con ﬁned to a small portion of the component. If, for
example, the component is predominantly elastic, and the creep zone is con ﬁned to a small region
near the crack tip, the crack growth can be characterized by the stress-intensity factor. In the other
extreme, when the component deforms globally in steady-state creep, elastic strains and tertiarycreep can be disregarded. A parameter that applies to the latter case is described below, followedby a brief discussion of approaches that consider the transition from elastic to steady-state creepbehavior.
4.2.1 T HE C* INTEGRAL
A formal fracture mechanics approach to creep crack growth was developed soon after the  J
integral was established as an elastic-plastic fracture parameter. Landes and Begley [45], Ohjiet al. [46], and Nikbin et al. [47] independently proposed what became known as the  C* integral
to characterize crack growth in a material undergoing steady-state creep. They applied Hoff ’s
analogy [48], which states that if there exists a nonlinear elastic body that obeys the relationship
εij = f(σij) and a viscous body that is characterized by  = f(σij), where the function of stress is
the same for both, then both bodies develop identical stress distributions when the same load isapplied. Hoff ’s analogy can be applied to steady-state creep, since the creep rate is a function
only of the applied stress.
The C * integral is deﬁ ned by replacing strains with strain rates, and displacements with displacement
rates in the  J contour integral:
(4.30)
where is the stress work rate (power) density, de ﬁned as
(4.31)
Hoff ’s analogy implies that the C* integral is path independent, because  J is path independent.
Also, if secondary creep follows a power law:
(4.32)
where A and n are material constants, then it is possible to deﬁne an HRR-type singularity for
stresses and strain rates near the crack tip:

where the constants In,ij, and  are identical to the corresponding parameters in the HRR relation-
ship (Equation (3.24)). Note that in the present case, n is a creep exponent rather than a strain-
hardening exponent.
Just as the  J integral characterizes the crack-tip ﬁelds in an elastic or elastic-plastic material,
the C * integral uniquely deﬁnes crack-tip conditions in a viscous material. Thus the time-dependent
crack growth rate in a viscous material should depend only on the value of  C*. Experimental studies
[45–49] have shown that creep crack growth rates correlate very well with  C*, provided steady-
state creep is the dominant deformation mechanism in the specimen. Figure 4.18 shows typical
creep crack growth data. Note that the crack growth rate follows a power law:
(4.34)
where γ and m  are material constants. In many materials, m ≈ n/(n + 1), a result that is predicted by
grain boundary cavitation models [49].
Experimental measurements of  C* take advantage of analogies with the  J integral. Recall that
J is usually measured by invoking the energy release rate de ﬁnition:

where  P is the applied load and ∆ is the load-line displacement. Similarly,  C* can be deﬁned in
terms of a power release rate:
(4.36)
The J  integral can be related to the energy absorbed by a laboratory specimen, divided by the
ligament area:2
(4.37)
where η is a dimensionless constant that depends on geometry. Therefore,  C* is given by
(4.38)
For a material that creeps according to a power law (Equation (4.32)), the displacement rate is
proportional to Pn, assuming global creep in the specimen. In this case, Equation (4.38) reduces to
(4.39)
The geometry factor η has been determined for a variety of test specimens. For example, η = 2.0
for a deeply notched bend specimen (Equation (3.37) and Equation (4.6)).
4.2.2 S HORT-TIME VS. LONG-TIME BEHAVIOR
The C * parameter applies only to crack growth in the presence of global steady-state creep. Stated
another way,  C* applies to long-time behavior, as discussed below.
Consider a stationary crack in a material that is susceptible to creep deformation. If a remote
load is applied to the cracked body, the material responds almost immediately with the correspondingelastic strain distribution. Assuming the loading is pure Mode I, the stresses and strains exhibit a
singularity near the crack tip and are uniquely de ﬁned by K
I. However, large-scale creep defor-
mation does not occur immediately. Soon after the load is applied, a small creep zone, analogous toa plastic zone, forms at the crack tip. The crack-tip conditions can be characterized by K
I as long as
the creep zone is embedded within the singularity dominated zone. The creep zone grows with time,eventually invalidating K
I as a crack-tip parameter. At long times, the creep zone spreads throughout
the entire structure.
When the crack grows with time, the behavior of the structure depends on the crack growth
rate relative to the creep rate. In brittle materials, the crack growth rate is so fast that it overtakesthe creep zone; crack growth can be characterized by K
I because the creep zone at the tip of the

of the crack, as discussed in Section 3.2.5. This distinction is not necessary in Equation (4.35) and Equation (4.36), because
the displacement component attributed to the uncracked conﬁguration vanishes when differentiated with respect to a.CBaPd *=−∂

growing crack remains small. At the other extreme, if the crack growth is suf ﬁciently slow that the
creep zone spreads throughout the structure,  C* is the appropriate characterizing parameter.
Riedel and Rice [50] analyzed the transition from short-time elastic behavior to long-time
viscous behavior. They assumed a simpli ﬁed stress-strain rate law that neglects primary creep:
(4.40)
for uniaxial tension. If a load is suddenly applied and then held constant, a creep zone gradually
develops in an elastic singularity zone, as discussed earlier. Riedel and Rice argued that the stresseswell within the creep zone can be described by
(4.41)
where  C(t) is a parameter that characterizes the amplitude of the local stress singularity in the creep
zone; C(t) varies with time and is equal to C* in the limit of long-time behavior. If the remote load
is ﬁxed, the stresses in the creep zone relax with time, as creep strain accumulates in the crack-tip
region. For small-scale creep conditions, C(t) decays as  1/t according to the following relationship:
(4.42)
The approximate size of the creep zone is given by
(4.43)
At 
θ = 90°, is a maximum and ranges from 0.2 to 0.5, depending on n. As rc increases in size,
C(t) approaches the steady-state value  C*. Riedel and Rice deﬁned a characteristic time for the
transition from short-time to long-time behavior:
(4.44a)
or
(4.44b)
When signiﬁ cant crack growth occurs over time scales much less than t1, the behavior can be
characterized by KI, while C* is the appropriate parameter when signiﬁ cant crack growth requires
times >> t1. Based on a ﬁ nite element analysis, Ehlers and Riedel [51] suggested the following
simple formula to interpolate between small-scale creep and extensive creep (short- and long-timebehavior, respectively):

Note the similarity to the transition time concept in dynamic fracture (Section 4.1.1). In both
instances, a transition time characterizes the interaction between two competing phenomena.
4.2.2.1 The Ct Parameter
Unlike KI and C *, a direct experimental measurement of C(t) under transient conditions is usually not
possible. Consequently, Saxena [52] de ﬁned an alternate parameter Ct which was originally intended
as an approximation of C(t). The advantage of Ct is that it can be measured relatively easily.
Saxena began by separating global displacement into instantaneous elastic and time-dependent
creep components:
(4.46)
The creep displacement ∆t increases with time as the creep zone grows. Also, if load is ﬁxed,
. The Ct parameter is deﬁned as the creep component of the power release rate:
(4.47)
Note the similarity between Equation (4.36) and Equation (4.47).
For small-scale creep conditions, Saxena de ﬁned an effective crack length, analogous to the
Irwin plastic zone correction described in Chapter 2:
(4.48)
where β ≈ and rc is deﬁned at θ = 90°. The displacement due to the creep zone is given by
(4.49)
where C is the elastic compliance, deﬁned in Chapter 2. Saxena showed that the small-scale creep
limit for Ct can be expressed as follows:
(4.50)
where is the geometry correction factor for Mode I stress intensity (see Table 2.4):
and f' is the ﬁrst derivative of f. Equation (4.50) predicts that ( Ct)ssc is proportional to KI4; thus Ct
does not coincide with C(t) in the limit of small-scale creep (Equation (4.42)).
Saxena proposed the following interpolation between small-scale creep and extensive creep:

where C* is determined from Equation (4.38) using the total displacement rate. In the limit of
long-time behavior, C*/Ct = 1.0, but this ratio is less than unity for small-scale creep and transient
behavior.
Bassani et al. [53] applied the  Ct parameter to experimental data with various C*/Ct ratios and
found that Ct characterized crack growth rates much better than  C* or KI. They state that Ct, when
deﬁned by Equation (4.50) and Equation (4.51), characterizes experimental data better than C(t),
as deﬁned by Riedel’ s approximation (Equation (4.45)).
Although Ct was originally intended as an approximation of C(t), it has become clear that these
two parameters are distinct from one another. The C(t) parameter characterizes the stresses ahead
of a stationary crack, while Ct is related to the rate of expansion of the creep zone. The latter
quantity appears to be better suited to materials that experience relatively rapid creep crack growth.
Both parameters approach C* in the limit of steady-state creep.
4.2.2.2 Primary Creep
The analyses introduced so far do not consider primary creep. Referring to Figure 4.17, which depicts
the most general case, the outer ring of the creep zone is in the primary stage of creep. Primary creepmay have an appreciable effect on the crack growth behavior if the size of the primary zone issigniﬁcant.
Recently, researchers have begun to develop crack growth analyses that include the effects of
primary creep. One such approach [54] considers a strain-hardening model for the primary creepdeformation, resulting in the following expression for total strain rate:
(4.51)
Riedel [54] introduced a new parameter C
h* which is the primary creep analog to C*. The
characteristic time that deﬁnes the transition from primary to secondary creep is deﬁned as
(4.52)
The stresses within the steady-state creep zone are still deﬁned by Equation (4.41), but the inter-polation scheme for C(t) is modiﬁed when primary creep strains are present [54]:
(4.53)
Equation (4.53) has been applied to experimental data in a limited number of cases. This relationshipappears to give a better description of experimental data than Equation (4.45), where the primaryterm is omitted.
Chun-Pok and McDowell [55] have incorporated the effects of primary creep into the estimation
of the C
t parameter.
4.3 VISCOELASTIC FRA CTURE MECHANICS
Polymeric materials have seen increasing service in structural applications in recent years. Conse-quently, the fracture resistance of these materials has become an important consideration. Much ofthe fracture mechanics methodology that was developed for metals is not directly transferable topolymers, however, because the latter behave in a viscoelastic manner.˙˙()εσσσ ε =+ ++−

Theoretical fracture mechanics analyses that incorporate viscoelastic material response are
relatively new, and practical applications of viscoelastic fracture mechanics are rare, as of this
writing. Most current applications to polymers utilize conventional, time-independent fracturemechanics methodology (see Chapter 6 and Chapter 8). Approaches that incorporate time depen-dence should become more widespread, however, as the methodology is developed further and isvalidated experimentally.
This section introduces viscoelastic fracture mechanics and outlines a number of recent
advances in this area. The work of Schapery [56–61] is emphasized, because he has formulatedthe most complete theoretical framework, and his approach is related to the  J and C * integrals,
which were introduced earlier in this text.
4.3.1 L INEAR VISCOELASTICITY
Viscoelasticity is perhaps the most general (and complex) type of time-dependent material response.From a continuum mechanics viewpoint, viscoplastic creep in metals is actually a special case ofviscoelastic material behavior. While creep in metals is generally considered permanent deformation,the strains can recover with time in viscoelastic materials. In the case of polymers, time-dependentdeformation and recovery is a direct result of their molecular structure, as discussed in Chapter 6.
Let us introduce the subject by considering linear viscoelastic material behavior. In this case,
linear  implies that the material meets two conditions: superposition and proportionality. The ﬁrst
condition requires that stresses and strains at time t be additive. For example, consider two uniaxial
strains 
ε1 and ε2, at time t, and the corresponding stresses σ(ε1) and σ(ε2). Superposition implies
(4.54)
If each stress is multiplied by a constant, the proportionality condition gives
(4.55)
If a uniaxial constant stress creep test is performed on a linear viscoelastic material, such that
σ = 0 for t < 0 and σ = σo for t > 0, the strain increases with time according to 
(4.56)
where D(t) is the creep compliance. The loading in this case can be represented more compactly
as σoH(t), where H(t) is the Heaviside step function, deﬁned as 
In the case of a constant uniaxial strain, i.e., ε = εoH(t), the stress is given by
(4.57)
where E(t) is the relaxation modulus. When εo is positive, the stress relaxes with time. Figure 4.19
schematically illustrates creep at a constant stress, and stress relaxation at a ﬁxed strain.
When stress and strain both vary, the entire deformation history must be taken into
account. The strain at time t is obtained by summing the strain increments from earlier times.σε σε σε ε[ ( )] [ ( )] [ ( ) ( )]12 1 2ttt t+= +

The incremental strain at time τ, where 0 < τ < t, that results from an incremental stress dσ H(t − τ)
is given by
(4.58)
Integrating this expression with respect to time t gives
(4.59)
where it is assumed that ε = σ = 0 at t = 0. In order to allow for a discontinuous change in stress
at t = 0, the lower integration limit is assumed to be 0−, an inﬁnitesimal time before t = 0.
Relationships such as Equation (4.59) are called hereditary integrals  because the conditions at time
t depend on prior history. The corresponding hereditary integral for stress is given by the inverse
of Equation (4.59):

By performing a Laplace transform on Equation (4.59) and Equation (4.60), it can be shown that
the creep compliance and the relaxation modulus are related as follows:
(4.61)
For deformation in three dimensions, the generalized hereditary integral for strain is given by
(4.62)
but symmetry considerations reduce the number of independent creep compliance constants. Inthe case of a linear viscoelastic isotropic material, there are two independent constants, and themechanical behavior can be described by E(t) or D(t), which are uniquely related, plus ν
c(t), the
Poisson’ s ratio for creep.
Following an approach developed by Schapery [59], it is possible to de ﬁne a pseudo-elastic
strain, which for uniaxial conditions is given by
(4.63)
where ER is a reference modulus. Substituting Equation (4.63) into Equation (4.59) gives
(4.64)
The pseudo-strains in three dimensions are related to the stress tensor through Hooke’ s law,
assuming isotropic material behavior:
(4.65)
where δij is the Kronecker delta, and the standard convention of summation on repeated indices is
followed. If νc = ν = constant with time, it can be shown that the three-dimensional generalization
of Equation (4.64) is given by
(4.66)
and the inverse of Equation  (4.66) is as follows:
(4.67)
The advantage of introducing pseudo-strains is that they can be related to stresses through
Hooke’ s law. Thus, if a linear elastic solution is known for a particular geometry, it is possible to
determine the corresponding linear viscoelastic solution through a hereditary integral. Given twoidentical conﬁgurations, one made from a linear elastic material and the other made from a linearviscoelastic material, the stresses in both bodies must be identical, and the strains are related throughEtdD

Equation (4.66) or Equation (4.67), provided both conﬁgurations are subject to the same applied
loads. This is a special case of a correspondence principle , which is discussed in more detail below;
note the similarity to Hoff ’s analogy for elastic and viscous materials (Section 4.2).
4.3.2 T HE VISCOELASTIC  J INTEGRAL
4.3.2.1 Constitutiv e Equations
Schapery [59] developed a generalized  J integral that is applicable to a wide range of viscoelastic
materials. He began by assuming a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive equation in the form of ahereditary integral:
(4.68)
where the lower integration limit is taken as 0
−. The pseudo-elastic strain is related to stress
through a linear or nonlinear elastic constitutive law. The similarity between Equation (4.66) andEquation (4.68) is obvious, but the latter relationship also applies to certain types of nonlinearviscoelastic behavior. The creep compliance D(t) has a somewhat different interpretation for the
nonlinear case.
The pseudo-strain tensor and reference modulus in Equation (4.68) are analogous to the linear
case. In the previous section, these quantities were introduced to relate a linear viscoelastic problemto a reference elastic problem. This idea is generalized in the present case, where the nonlinearviscoelastic behavior is related to a reference nonlinear elastic problem through a correspondenceprinciple, as discussed below.
The inverse of Equation (4.68) is given by
(4.69)
Since hereditary integrals of the form of Equation (4.68) and Equation (4.69) are used extensivelyin the remainder of this discussion, it is convenient to introduce an abbreviated notation:
(4.70a)
and
(4.70b)
where f is a function of time. In each case, it is assumed that integration begins at 0
−. Thus
Equation (4.68) and Equation (4.69) become, respectively,
and
4.3.2.2 Correspondence Principle
Consider two bodies with the same instantaneous geometry, where one material is elastic and
the other is viscoelastic and is described by Equation (4.68). Assume that at time t, a surface

and strains in the elastic body are σije and εije, respectively, while the corresponding quantities
in the viscoelastic body are σij and εij, the stresses, strains, and displacements are related as
follows [59]:
, , (4.71)
Equation (4.71) deﬁnes a correspondence principle, introduced by Schapery [59], which allows the
solution to a viscoelastic problem to be inferred from a reference elastic solution. This correspon-dence principle stems from the fact that the stresses in both bodies must satisfy equilibrium, andthe strains must satisfy compatibility requirements in both cases. Also, the stresses are equal onthe boundaries by deﬁnition:
Schapery [59] gives a rigorous proof of Equation (4.71) for viscoelastic materials that satisfy
Equation (4.68).
Applications of correspondence principles in viscoelasticity, where the viscoelastic solution is
related to a corresponding elastic solution, usually involve performing a Laplace transform on ahereditary integral in the form of Equation (4.62), which contains actual stresses and strains. Theintroduction of pseudo-quantities makes the connection between viscoelastic and elastic solutionsmore straightforward.
4.3.2.3 Generalized J Integral
The correspondence principle in Equation (4.71) makes it possible to deﬁne a generalized time-
dependent  J integral by forming an analogy with the nonlinear elastic case:
(4.72)
where w
e is the pseudo-strain energy density:
(4.73)
The stresses in Equation (4.72) are the actual values in the body, but the strains and displacementsare pseudo-elastic values. The actual strains and displacements are given by Equation (4.71).Conversely, if 
εij and ui are known,  Jv can be determined by computing pseudo-values, which are
inserted into Equation (4.73). The pseudo-strains and displacements are given by
and (4.74)
Consider a simple example, where the material exhibits steady-state creep at  t > to. The hereditary
integrals for strain and displacement reduce to

202 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
By inserting the above results into Equation (4.73), we see that  Jv = C*. Thus C* is a special case
of Jv. The latter parameter is capable of taking account of a wide range of time-dependent material
behavior, and includes viscous creep as a special case.
Near the tip of the crack, the stresses and pseudo-strains are characterized by  Jv through an
HRR-type relationship in the form of Equation (4.33). The viscoelastic  J can also be determined
through a pseudo-energy release rate:
(4.75)
where ∆eis the pseudo-displacement in the loading direction, which is related to the actual
displacement by
(4.76)
Finally, for Mode I loading of a linear viscoelastic material in plane strain,  Jv is related to the
stress-intensity factor as follows:
(4.77)
The stress-intensity factor is related to specimen geometry, applied loads, and crack dimensions
through the standard equations outlined in Chapter 2.
4.3.2.4 Crack Initiation and Growth
When characterizing crack initiation and growth, it is useful to relate  Jv to physical parameters
such as CTOD and fracture work, which can be used as local failure criteria. Schapery [59] derived

material in the failure zone may be severely damaged and contain voids and other discontinuities,
it is assumed that the surrounding material can be treated as a continuum. If σm does not vary with
x, applying Equation (3.44) gives
(4.78)
where δe is the pseudo-crack-tip-opening displacement, which is related to the actual CTOD through
a hereditary integral of the form of Equation (4.77). Thus the CTOD is given by
(4.79)
Although σm was assumed to be independent of x at time t, Equation (4.79) permits σm to vary
with time. The CTOD can be utilized as a local failure criterion: If crack initiation occurs at δi,
the Jv at initiation can be inferred from Equation (4.79). If δi is assumed to be constant, the critical
Jv would, in general, depend on the strain rate. A more general version of Equation (4.79) can be
derived by allowing σm to vary with x.
An alternative local failure criterion is the fracture work wf. Equating the work input to the
crack tip to the energy required to advance the crack tip by da results in the following energy
balance at initiation:
(4.80)
assuming unit thickness and Mode I loading. This energy balance can also be written in terms ofa time integral:
(4.81)
Inserting Equation (4.79) into Equation (4.81) gives

If 
σm is independent of time, it cancels out of Equation (4.82), which then simpli ﬁes to

For an elastic material, D = ER−1 and Jv = 2wf. If the failure zone is viscoelastic and the surrounding
continuum is elastic,  Jv may vary with time. If the surrounding continuum is viscous, ,

4.3.3 T RANSITION  FROM LINEAR TO NONLINEAR  BEHAVIOR
Typical polymers are linear viscoelastic at low stresses and nonlinear at high stresses. A specimen
that contains a crack may have a zone of nonlinearity at the crack tip, analogous to a plasticzone, which is surrounded by linear viscoelastic material. The approach described in the previoussection applies only when one type of behavior (linear or nonlinear) dominates.
Schapery [61] has modiﬁed the  J
v concept to cover the transition from small-stress to large-
stress behavior. He introduced a modiﬁed constitutive equation, where the strain is given by thesum of two hereditary integrals: one corresponding to linear viscoelastic strains and the otherdescribing nonlinear strains. For the latter term, he assumed power-law viscoelasticity. For the caseof uniaxial constant tensile stress 
σo the creep strain in this modiﬁed model is given by
(4.85)
where D and DL are the nonlinear and linear creep compliance, respectively, and σref is a reference
stress.
At low stresses and short times, the second term in Equation (4.85) dominates, while the nonlinear
term dominates at high stresses or long times. In the case of a viscoelastic body with a stationarycrack at a ﬁ xed load, the nonlinear zone is initially small but normally increases with time, until the
behavior is predominantly nonlinear. Thus there is a direct analogy between the present case and thetransition from elastic to viscous behavior described in Section 4.2.
Close to the crack tip, but outside of the failure zone, the stresses are related to a pseudo-strain
through a power law:
(4.86)
In the region dominated by Equation (4.86), the stresses are characterized by  J
v, regardless of whether
the global behavior is linear or nonlinear:
(4.87)
If the global behavior is linear, there is a second singularity further away from the crack tip:
(4.88)
Let us deﬁne a pseudo-strain tensor that, when inserted into the path-independent integral of
Equation (4.72), yields a value  JL. Also suppose that this pseudo-strain tensor is related to the stress
tensor by means of linear and power-law pseudo-complementary strain energy density functions(w
cl and wcn, respectively):

where f(t) is an as yet unspeciﬁed aging function, and the complementary strain energy density is
deﬁned by
For uniaxial deformation, Equation (4.89) reduces to
(4.90)
Comparing Equation (4.85) and Equation (4.90), it can be seen that
if for constant stress creep.
The latter relationship for pseudo-strain agrees with the conventional deﬁnition in the limit of linear
behavior.
Let us now consider the case where the inner and outer singularities, Equation (4.87) and
Equation (4.88), exist simultaneously. For the outer singularity, the second term in Equation (4.90)dominates, the stresses are given by Equation (4.88), and  J
L is related to KI as follows:
(4.91)
Closer to the crack tip, the stresses are characterized by  Jv through Equation (4.87), but  JL is not
necessarily equal to  Jv, because f appears in the ﬁrst term of the modiﬁed constitutive relationship
(Equation (4.90)), but not in Equation (4.86). These two deﬁ nitions of  J coincide if σref in
Equation (4.90) is replaced with . Thus, the near-tip singularity in terms of  JL is given by
(4.92)
therefore,
(4.93)
Schapery showed that f = 1 in the limit of purely linear behavior; thus  JL is the limiting value of
Jv when the nonlinear zone is negligible. The function f is indicative of the extent of nonlinearity.
In most cases, f increases with time, until  Jv reaches  Jn, the limiting value when the specimen is
dominated by nonlinear viscoelasticity. Schapery also con ﬁrmed that

for small-scale nonlinearity. Equation (4.93) and Equation (4.94) provide a reasonable description
of the transition to nonlinear behavior. Schapery de ﬁned a transition time by setting  Jv = Jn in
Equation (4.93):
(4.95a)
or
(4.95b)
For the special case of linear behavior followed by viscous creep, Equation (4.95b) becomes

which is identical to the transition time deﬁned by Riedel and Rice [50].
APPENDIX 4: DYN AMIC FRA CTURE ANALYSIS
A4.1 E LASTODYNAMIC  CRACK TIP FIELDS
Rice [31], Sih [35], and Irwin [62] each derived expressions for the stresses ahead of a crackpropagating at a constant speed. They found that the moving crack retained the singularity,but that the angular dependence of the stresses, strains, and displacements depends on crack speed.Freund and Clifton [32] and Nilsson [33] later showed that the solution for a constant speed crackwas valid in general; the near-tip quantities depend only on instantaneous crack speed. The followingderivation presents the more general case, where the crack speed is allowed to vary.
For dynamic problems, the equations of equilibrium are replaced by the equations of motion,
which, in the absence of body forces, are given by
(A4.1)
where x
j denotes the orthogonal coordinates and each dot indicates a time derivative. For quasistatic
problems, the term on the right side of Equation (A4.1) vanishes. For a linear elastic material, itis possible to write the equations of motion in terms of displacements and elastic constants byinvoking the strain-displacement and stress-strain relationships:

Let us now introduce a moving coordinate system ( x,y) attached to the crack tip, where
x = X − a(t) and y = Y. The rate of change of each wave potential can be written as
(i = 1, 2) (A4.6)
where  V(= −dx/dt) is the crack speed. Differentiating Equation (A4.6) with respect to time gives
(A4.7)
According to Equation (A4.5) the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Equation (A4.7) is proportional
to the stress tensor. This term should dominate close to the crack tip, assuming there is a stresssingularity. Substituting the ﬁrst term of Equation (A4.7) into Equation (A4.4) leads to
(A4.8a)
and
(A4.8b) 
where
and
Note that the governing equations depend only on instantaneous crack speed; the term that containscrack acceleration in Equation (A4.7) is negligible near the crack tip.
If we scale y by deﬁning new coordinates, y
1 = β1y and y2 = β2y, Equation (A4.8) becomes
the Laplace equation. Freund and Clifton [32] applied a complex variable method to solve Equation(A4.8). The general solutions to the wave potentials are as follows:

where F and G are as yet unspeciﬁed complex functions, z

following functions satisfy the boundary conditions and lead to integrable strain energy density

expressions for the Mode I crack-tip stress ﬁelds:

where
Equation (A4.12) reduces to the quasistatic relationship (Table 2.1) when  V = 0.

release rate for crack propagation at a constant speed:
(A4.13)
for plane strain, where
It can be shown that , and Equation (A4.13) reduces to the quasistatic result. Equation
(A4.13) can be derived by substituting the dynamic crack-tip solution (Equation (A4.12) and thecorresponding relationships for strain and displacement) into the generalized contour integral givenby Equation (4.26).
The derivation that led to Equation (A4.12) implies that Equation (A4.13) is a general rela-
tionship that applies to accelerating cracks as well as constant speed cracks.
A4.2 D ERIVATION  OF THE GENERALIZED  ENERGY  RELEASE  RATE
Equation (4.26) will now be derived. The approach closely follows that of Moran and Shih [11],who applied a general balance law to derive a variety of contour integrals, including the energyrelease rate.

Beginning with the equation of motion, Equation (A4.1), taking an inner product of both sides
with displacement rate and rearranging gives
(A4.14)
where T and w  are the kinetic energy and stress work densities, respectively, as de ﬁned in
Equation (4.27) to Equation (4.29). Equation (A4.14) is a general balance law that applies to all

Equation (A4.16) corresponds to the rate at which energy is lost from the body due to ﬂux through
Γ. By deﬁning nj = −mj on Γ, we obtain the following expression for the energy ﬂux into Γ:
(A4.17)
In the limit of a vanishingly small contour, the ﬂux is independent of the shape of Γ. Thus, the
energy ﬂux to the crack tip is given by
(A4.18)
In an increment of time dt, the crack extends by da = Vdt and the energy expended is Φdt. Thus,
the energy release rate is given by
(A4.19)
Substituting Equation (A4.18) into Equation (A4.19) will yield a generalized expression for the  J
integral. First, however, we must express the displacement rate in terms of crack speed. By analogywith Equation (A4.6), the displacement rate can be written as
(A4.20)
Under steady-state conditions, the second term in Equation (A4.20) vanishes; the displacement ata ﬁxed distance from the propagating crack tip remains constant. Close to the crack tip, the
displacement changes rapidly with position (at a ﬁxed time) and the ﬁrst term in Equation (A4.20)dominates in all cases. Thus, the  J integral is given by
(A4.21)
Equation (A4.21) applies to all types of material response (e.g., elastic, plastic, viscoplastic, andviscoelastic behavior), because it was derived from a generalized energy balance.
3 In the special
case of an elastic material (linear or nonlinear), w is the strain energy density, which displays the
properties of an elastic potential:

Recall from Appendix 3 that Equation (A4.22) is necessary to demonstrate the path independenceof J in the quasistatic case. In general, Equation (A4.21) is not path independent except in a local

region near the crack tip. For an elastic material, however,  J is path independent in the dynamic
case when the crack propagation is steady state [8].
Although Equation (A4.22) is, in principle, applicable to all types of material response, special
care must be taken when  J is evaluated for a growing crack. Figure A4.3(a) illustrates a growing
crack under small-scale yielding conditions. A small plastic zone (or process zone) is embedded
within an elastic singularity zone. The plastic zone leaves behind a wake as it sweeps through thematerial. Unrecoverable work is performed on the material inside the plastic wake, as Figure A4.3(b)illustrates. The work necessary to form the plastic wake comes from the energy ﬂux into the contour
Γ. In an ideally elastic body, the energy ﬂux is released from the body through the crack tip, butin an elastic-plastic material, the majority of this energy is dissipated in the wake.
Recall the modiﬁed Grif ﬁth model (Section 2.3.2), where the work required to increase the
crack area a unit amount is equal to 2(
γs + γp), where γs is the surface energy and γp is the plastic
work. The latter term corresponds to the energy dissipated in the plastic wake (Figure 2.6(b)).
The energy release rate computed from Equation (A4.21) must therefore be interpreted as
the energy ﬂ ow to the plastic zone and plastic wake, rather than to the crack tip. That is, Γ cannot
shrink to zero; rather, the contour must have a small, but ﬁ nite radius. The  J integral is path
independent as long as Γ is deﬁ ned within the elastic singularity zone, but  J becomes path
dependent when the contour is taken inside the plastic zone. In the limit, as Γ shrinks to the
crack tip, the computed energy release rate would approach zero (in a continuum analysis), sincethe calculation would exclude the work dissipated by the plastic wake. The actual energy ﬂ ow
to the crack tip is not zero, since a portion of the energy is required to break bonds at the tip.In all but the most brittle materials, however, the bond energy (
γs) is a small fraction of the total
fracture energy.
As long as the plastic zone or process zone is embedded within an elastic singularity, the energy
release rate can be deﬁned unambiguously for a growing crack. In large-scale yielding conditions,however,  J is path dependent. Consequently, an unambiguous deﬁnition of ener gy release rate does
not exist for a crack growing in an elastic-plastic or fully plastic body .  Recall from Chapter 3 that
there are several deﬁnitions of  J for growing cracks. The so-called deformation  J, which is based
on a pseudo-energy release rate concept, is the most common methodology. The deformation  J is
not, in general, equal to the  J integral inferred from a contour integration.FIGURE A4.3 Crack growth in small-scale yielding. The plastic wake, which forms behind the growing crack,

Part III 
Material Behavior 
Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 give an overview of the micromechanisms of fracture in various material
systems. This subject is of obvious importance to materials scientists, because an understandingof microstructural events that lead to fracture is essential to the development of materials withoptimum toughness. Those who approach fracture from a solid mechanics viewpoint, however,often sidestep microstructural issues and consider only continuum models.
In certain cases, classical fracture mechanics provides some justiﬁcation for disregarding
microscopic failure mechanisms. Just as it is not necessary to understand dislocation theory toapply tensile data to design, it  
may 
 not be necessary to consider the microscopic details of fracture
when applying fracture mechanics on a global scale. When a single parameter (i.e., 
 K 
, 
 J 
, or 
  
crack-
tip-opening displacement (CTOD)) uniquely characterizes crack-tip conditions, a critical value ofthis parameter is a material constant that is transferable from a test specimen to a structure madefrom the same material (see Section 2.9 and Section 3.5). A laboratory specimen and a ﬂawed
structure experience identical crack-tip conditions at failure when the single parameter assumptionis valid, and it is not necessary to delve into the details of microscopic failure to characterize globalfracture.
The situation becomes considerably more complicated when the single-parameter assumption
ceases to be valid. A fracture toughness test on a small-scale laboratory specimen is no longer areliable indicator of how a large structure will behave. The fracture toughness of the structure andtest specimen are likely to be different, and the two conﬁgurations may even fail by differentmechanisms. A number of researchers are currently attempting to develop alternatives to singleparameter fracture mechanics (see Section 3.6). Such approaches cannot succeed with continuumtheory alone, but must also consider microscopic fracture mechanisms. Thus, the next two chaptersshould be of equal value to materials scientists and solid mechanicians.

Fracture Mechanisms in Metals 
Figure 5.1 schematically illustrates three of the most common fracture mechanisms in metals and
alloys. (A fourth mechanism, fatigue, is discussed in Chapter 10.) Ductile materials (Figure 5.1(a))usually fail as the result of nucleation, growth, and the coalescence of microscopic voids that initiateat inclusions and second-phase particles. Cleavage fracture (Figure 5.1(b)) involves separation alongspeciﬁc crystallographic planes. Note that the fracture path is transgranular. Although cleavage isoften called brittle fracture, it can be preceded by large-scale plasticity and ductile crack growth.Intergranular fracture (Figure 5.1(c)), as its name implies, occurs when the grain boundaries arethe preferred fracture path in the material. 
5.1DUCTILE FRACTURE 
Figure 5.2 schematically illustrates the uniaxial tensile behavior in a ductile metal. The materialeventually reaches an instability point, where strain hardening cannot keep pace with the loss inthe cross-sectional area, and a necked region forms beyond the maximum load. In very high puritymaterials, the tensile specimen may neck down to a sharp point, resulting in extremely large localplastic strains and nearly 100% reduction in area. Materials that contain impurities, however, failat much lower strains. Microvoids nucleate at inclusions and second-phase particles; the voids growtogether to form a macroscopic ﬂaw, which leads to fracture.
The commonly observed stages in ductile fracture [1–5] are as follows:
1. Formation of a free surface at an inclusion or second-phase particle by either interface
decohesion or particle cracking.
2. Growth of the void around the particle, by means of plastic strain and hydrostatic stress.
3. Coalescence of the growing void with adjacent voids.
In materials where the second-phase particles and inclusions are well-bonded to the matrix, void
nucleation is often the critical step; fracture occurs soon after the voids form. When void nucleationoccurs with little difﬁculty, the fracture properties are controlled by the growth and coalescence ofvoids; the growing voids reach a critical size, relative to their spacing, and a local plastic instabilitydevelops between voids, resulting in failure.

UCLEATION 
A void forms around a second-phase particle or inclusion when sufﬁcient stress is applied to breakthe interfacial bonds between the particle and the matrix. A number of models for estimating voidnucleation stress have been published, some of which are based on continuum theory [6, 7] whileothers incorporate dislocation-particle interactions [8, 9]. The latter models are required for particles 
<

m in diameter.
The most widely used continuum model for void nucleation is due to Argon et al. [6]. They
argued that the interfacial stress at a cylindrical particle is approximately equal to the sum of themean (hydrostatic) stress and the effective (von Mises) stress. The decohesion stress is deﬁned asa critical combination of these two stresses:

 are the principal normal stresses. According to the Argon et al. model, the
nucleation strain decreases as the hydrostatic stress increases. That is, void nucleation occurs more
readily in a triaxial tensile stress ﬁeld, a result that is consistent with experimental observations.
The Beremin research group in France [7] applied the Argon et al. criterion to experimental
data for a carbon manganese steel, but found that the following semiempirical relationship gavebetter predictions of void nucleation at MnS inclusions that were elongated in the rolling direction:

 is a ﬁtting parameter that is approximately 1.6 for longitudinal

Goods and Brown [9] have developed a dislocation model for void nucleation at submicron
particles. They estimated that dislocations near the particle elevate the stress at the interface by thefollowing amount:

Experimental observations usually differ from both continuum and dislocation models, in that
void nucleation tends to occur more readily at large particles [10]. Recall, however, that these
models only considered nucleation by particle-matrix debonding. V oids can also be nucleated whenparticles crack. Larger particles are more likely to crack in the presence of plastic strain, becausethey are more likely to contain small defects that can act like Grifﬁth cracks (see Section 5.2). Inaddition, large nonmetallic inclusions, such as oxides and sulﬁdes, are often damaged duringfabrication; some of these particles may be cracked or debonded prior to plastic deformation,making void nucleation relatively easy. Further research is obviously needed to develop voidnucleation models that are more in line with experiments.

OALESCENCE 
Once voids form, further plastic strain and hydrostatic stress cause the voids to grow and eventuallycoalesce. Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4 are scanning electron microscope (SEM) fractographs that showdimpled fracture surfaces that are typical of microvoid coalescence. Figure 5.4 shows an inclusionthat nucleated a void.
Figure 5.5 schematically illustrates the growth and coalescence of microvoids. If the initial volume
fraction of voids is low ( 
< 
10%), each void can be assumed to grow independently; upon further
growth, neighboring voids interact. Plastic strain is concentrated along a sheet of voids, and localnecking instabilities develop. The orientation of the fracture path depends on the stress state [11].
Many materials contain a bimodal or trimodal distribution of particles. For example, a precipitation-
hardened aluminum alloy may contain relatively large intermetallic particles, together with a ﬁnedispersion of submicron second-phase precipitates. These alloys also contain micron-size dispersoidparticles for grain reﬁnement. V oids form much more readily in the inclusions, but the smallerparticles can contribute in certain cases. Bimodal particle distributions can lead to so-called shearfracture surfaces, as described in the next paragraph.

Figure 5.6 illustrates the formation of the ‘‘cup and cone’’ fracture surface that is commonly
observed in uniaxial tensile tests. The neck produces a triaxial stress state in the center of the
specimen, which promotes void nucleation and growth in the larger particles. Upon further strain,the voids coalesce, resulting in a penny-shaped ﬂaw. The outer ring of the specimen containsrelatively few voids, because the hydrostatic stress is lower than in the center. The penny-shapedﬂaw produces deformation bands at 45 
° 
 from the tensile axis. This concentration of strain provides
sufﬁcient plasticity to nucleate voids in the smaller more numerous particles. Since the smallparticles are closely spaced, an instability occurs soon after these smaller voids form, resulting inthe total fracture of the specimen and the cup and cone appearance of the matching surfaces. Thecentral region of the fracture surface has a ﬁbrous appearance at low magniﬁcations, but the outerregion is relatively smooth. Because the latter surface is oriented 45 
° 
 from the tensile axis and
there is little evidence (at low magniﬁcations) of microvoid coalescence, many refer to this typeof surface as “shear fracture.” The 45 
° 
 angle between the fracture plane and the applied stress
results in a combined Mode I/Mode II loading.
Figure 5.7 is a photograph of the cross-section of a fractured tensile specimen; note the high
concentration of microvoids in the center of the necked region, compared with the edges of thenecked region.
Figure 5.8 shows SEM fractographs of a cup and cone fracture surface. The central portion of
the specimen exhibits a typical dimpled appearance, but the outer region appears to be relativelysmooth, particularly at low magniﬁcation (Figure 5.8(a)). At somewhat higher magniﬁcation (Figure 5.8(b)),a few widely spaced voids are evident in the outer region. Figure 5.9 shows a representativefractograph at higher magniﬁcation of the 45 
° 
 shear surface. Note the dimpled appearance, which
is characteristic of microvoid coalescence. The average void size and spacing, however, are muchsmaller than in the central region of the specimen.
There are a number of mathematical models for void growth and coalescence. The two most
widely referenced models were published by Rice and Tracey [12] and Gurson [13]. The latterapproach was actually based on the work of Berg [14], but it is commonly known as the Gursonmodel. The Gurson model has subsequently been modiﬁed by Tvergaard and others [15–18].

where  and  is the equivalent (von Mises) plastic strain. Subsequent inves-
tigators found that Equation (5.11) could be approximately modiﬁed for strain hardening by
replacing the yield strength with σe, the effective stress [20].
Since the Rice and Tracey model is based on a single void, it does not take account of
interactions between voids, nor does it predict ultimate failure. A separate failure criterion must beapplied to characterize microvoid coalescence. For example, one might assume that fracture occurswhen the nominal void radius reaches a critical value.
A model originally developed by Gurson [13] and later modiﬁed by Tvergaard [15, 16] analyzes
the plastic ﬂow in a porous medium by assuming that the material behaves as a continuum. V oidsappear in the model indirectly through their inﬂuence on the global ﬂow behavior. The effect ofthe voids is averaged through the material, which is assumed to be continuous and homogeneous(Figure 5.11). The main difference between the Gurson-Tvergaard (GT) model and classical plas-ticity is that the yield surface in the former exhibits a hydrostatic stress dependence, while classicalplasticity assumes that yielding is independent of hydrostatic stress. This modiﬁcation to conven-tional plasticity theory has the effect of introducing a strain-softening term.
Unlike the Rice and Tracey model, the GT model contains a failure criterion. Ductile fracture
is assumed to occur as the result of a plastic instability that produces a band of localized deformation.Such an instability occurs more readily in a GT material because of the strain softening inducedby hydrostatic stress. However, because the model does not consider discrete voids, it is unable topredict the necking instability between voids.
The model derives from a rigid-plastic limit analysis of a solid having a smeared volume fraction
f of voids approximated by a homogeneous spherical body containing a spherical void. The yieldsurface and ﬂow potential g is given by

Values of q1 = 1.5, q2 = 1.0, and q3 = q12are typically used for metals. Setting f = 0 recovers
the von Mises yield surface for an incompressible material.
In the most recent formulation of the GT model [17], the void growth rate has the following
form:
(5.13)
where the ﬁrst term deﬁnes the growth rate of the preexisting voids and the second term quantiﬁes
the contribution of new voids that are nucleated with plastic strain. The scaling coefﬁcient Λ, which
is applied to the plastic strain rate of the cell matrix material, is given by
(5.14)
In the above expression, the plastic strain range at nucleation of new voids follows a normal
distribution with a mean value εN, a standard deviation sN, and a volume fraction of void nucleating
particles fN. Introducing void nucleation into the GT model results in additional ﬁtting parameters
(εN, sN, and fN). Moreover, this void nucleation expression is not consistent with the models presented
in Section 5.1.1 because the former implies that nucleation does not depend on hydrostatic stress.Further research is obviously necessary to sort out these inconsistencies.
In the absence of the void nucleation term in Equation (5.13), the key input parameters to the
GT model are the initial void fraction f
o and the critical void fraction fc. In real materials, voids
grow very rapidly when the void fraction exceeds 10 to 20%. Equation (5.12) does not adequatelycapture the ﬁnal stage of rapid void growth and coalescence. Consequently, failure is often assumedwhen the void fracture reaches a critical value f
c. This is a reasonable assumption because failure
in real materials is very abrupt with little additional macroscopic strain once the void fractionexceeds f
c. A typical assumption for carbon steels is fc = 0.15. The initial void fraction fo is normally
used as a ﬁtting parameter to experimental data.
Tvergaard and Needleman [18] have attempted to model void coalescence by replacing f with
an effective void volume fraction f*:
(5.15)
where fc, fu*, and fF are ﬁtting parameters. The effect of hydrostatic stress is ampliﬁed when f > fc,
which accelerates the onset of a plastic instability. As a practical matter, it is probably sufﬁcientto assume failure when f exceeds f
c. The marginal beneﬁt of applying Equation (5.15) is offset by
the need to deﬁne the additional ﬁtting parameters fu* and fF. Consequently, Equation (5.15) has
fallen out of favor in recent years.
Thomason [11] developed a simple limit load model for internal necking between microvoids.
This model states that failure occurs when the net section stress between voids reaches a criticalvalue 
σn(c). Figure 5.12 illustrates a two-dimensional case, where cylindrical voids are growing in
a material subject to plane strain loading ( ε3 = 0). If the in-plane dimensions of the voids are 2 a
and 2b, and the spacing between voids is 2 d, the row of voids illustrated in Figure 5.12 is stable if

and fracture occurs when
(5.16b)
where σ1 is the maximum remote principal stress. As with Equation (5.15), the Thomason model
is of limited practical value. The void interactions leading to ductile failure are far too complex to
be captured by a simple area reduction model. Moreover, the ﬁnal stage in failure is very abrupt,as discussed earlier. Once the void fraction reaches 10 to 20%, failure occurs with only a minimalincrease in the nominal strain.
5.1.3 D UCTILE  CRACK GROWTH
Figure 5.13 schematically illustrates microvoid initiation, growth, and coalescence at the tip of apreexisting crack. As the cracked structure is loaded, local strains and stresses at the crack tipbecome sufﬁcient to nucleate voids. These voids grow as the crack blunts, and they eventually linkwith the main crack. As this process continues, the crack grows.
Figure 5.14 is a plot of stress and strain near the tip of a blunted crack [21]. The strain exhibits
a singularity near the crack tip, but the stress reaches a peak at approximately two times the crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD).
1 In most materials, the triaxiality ahead of the crack tip provides
sufﬁcient stress elevation for void nucleation; thus the growth and coalescence of microvoids areusually the critical steps in ductile crack growth. Nucleation typically occurs when a particle is∼2
δ from the crack tip, while most of the void growth occurs much closer to the crack tip, relative
to CTOD. (Note that although a void remains approximately ﬁxed in absolute space, its distance
from the crack tip, relative to  CTOD, decreases as the crack blunts; the absolute  distance from the
crack tip also decreases as the crack grows.)
Ductile crack growth is usually stable because it produces a rising resistance curve, at least
during the early stages of crack growth. Stable crack growth and R curves are discussed in detail
in Chapter 3 and Chapter 7.
When an edge crack in a plate grows by microvoid coalescence, the crack exhibits a tunneling
effect, where it grows faster at the center of the plate, due to the higher stress triaxiality.FIGURE 5.12 The limit-load model for void insta-
bility. Failure is assumed to occur when the net sec-
tion stress between voids reaches a critical value.
1 Finite element analysis and slip line analysis of blunted crack tips predict a stress singularity very close to the crack tip
(∼0.1 CTOD), but it is not clear whether or not this actually occurs in real materials because the continuum assumptions
break down at such ﬁne scales.

The through-thickness variation of triaxiality also produces shear lips , where the crack growth
near the free surface occurs at a 45 ° angle from the maximum principal stress, as illustrated in
Figure 5.15. The shear lips are very similar to the cup and cone features in fractured tensile
specimens. The growing crack at the center of the plate produces deformation bands that nucleatevoids in small particles (Figure 5.6). 
The high-triaxiality crack growth at the center of a plate appears to be relatively ﬂat, but closer
examination reveals a more complex structure. For a crack subject to plane strain Mode I loading,the maximum plastic strain occurs at 45 ° from the crack plane, as illustrated in Figure 5.16(a). On
a local level, this angle is the preferred path for void coalescence, but global constraints requirethat the crack propagation remain in its original plane. One way to reconcile these competingrequirements is for the crack to grow in a zigzag pattern (Figure 5.16(b)), such that the crackappears ﬂat on a global scale, but oriented ±45° from the crack propagation direction when viewed
at higher magniﬁcation. This zigzag pattern is often observed in ductile materials [22, 23].Figure 5.17 shows a metallographic cross-section of a growing crack that exhibits this behavior.FIGURE 5.15 Ductile growth of an edge crack. The shear lips are produced by the same mechanism as the
cup and cone in uniaxial tension ( Figure  5.7).

5.2 CLEAVAGE
Cleavage fracture can be deﬁned as the rapid propagation of a crack along a particular crystallo-
graphic plane. Cleavage may be brittle, but it can be preceded by large-scale plastic ﬂow and ductilecrack growth (see Section 5.3). The preferred cleavage planes are those with the lowest packingdensity, since fewer bonds must be broken and the spacing between planes is greater. In the caseof body-centered cubic (BCC) materials, cleavage occurs on {100} planes. The fracture path istransgranular in polycrystalline materials, as Figure 5.1(b) illustrates. The propagating crackchanges direction each time it crosses a grain boundary; the crack seeks the most favorably orientedcleavage plane in each grain. The nominal orientation of the cleavage crack is perpendicular to themaximum principal stress.
Cleavage is most likely when the plastic ﬂow is restricted. Face-centered cubic (FCC) metals
are usually not susceptible to cleavage because there are ample slip systems for ductile behaviorat all temperatures. At low temperatures, BCC metals fail by cleavage because there are a limitednumber of active slip systems. Polycrystalline hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metals, which haveonly three slip systems per grain, are also susceptible to cleavage fracture.
This section and Section 5.3 focus on ferritic steel, because it is the most technologically important
(and the most extensively studied) material that is subject to cleavage fracture. This class of materialshas a BCC crystal structure, which undergoes a ductile-brittle transition with decreasing temperature.Many of the mechanisms described below also operate in other material systems that fail by cleavage.
5.2.1 F RACTOGRAPHY
Figure 5.18 shows SEM fractographs of cleavage fracture in a low-alloy steel. The multifacetedsurface is typical of cleavage in a polycrystalline material; each facet corresponds to a single grain.The ‘‘river patterns’’ on each facet are also typical of cleavage fracture. These markings are sonamed because multiple lines converge to a single line, much like tributaries to a river.
Figure 5.19 illustrates how river patterns are formed. A propagating cleavage crack encounters
a grain boundary, where the nearest cleavage plane in the adjoining grain is oriented at a ﬁniteFIGURE 5.17 Optical micrograph (unetched) of ductile crack growth in an A 710 high-strength low-alloy

twist angle from the current cleavage plane. Initially, the crack accommodates the twist mismatch
by forming on several parallel planes. As the multiple cracks propagate, they are joined by tearingbetween planes. Since this process consumes more energy than the crack propagation on a singleplane, there is a tendency for the multiple cracks to converge into a single crack. Thus, the directionof crack propagation can be inferred from the river patterns. Figure 5.20 shows a fractograph ofriver patterns in a low-alloy steel, where tearing between parallel cleavage planes is evident.
5.2.2 M ECHANISMS  OF CLEAVAGE  INITIATION
Since cleavage involves breaking bonds, the local stress must be sufﬁcient to overcome the cohesivestrength of the material. In Chapter 2, we learned that the theoretical fracture strength of a crystallineFIGURE 5.18 SEM fractographs of cleavage in an A 508 Class 3 alloy. Photographs courtesy of Mr. Sun

236 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
solid is approximately E/π. Figure 5.14, however, indicates that the maximum stress achieved ahead
of the crack tip is three to four times the yield strength. For a steel with σYS = 400 MPa and E =
210,000 MPa, the cohesive strength would be ~50 times higher than the maximum stress achieved
ahead of the crack tip. Thus, a macroscopic crack provides insufﬁcient stress concentration toexceed the bond strength.
In order for cleavage to initiate, there must be a local discontinuity ahead of the macroscopic
crack that is sufﬁcient to exceed the bond strength. A sharp microcrack is one way to providesufﬁcient local stress concentration. Cottrell [24] postulated that microcracks form at intersectingFIGURE 5.19 Formation of river patterns, as a result of a cleavage crack crossing a twist boundary between
grains.

slip planes by means of dislocation interaction. A far more common mechanism for microcrack
formation in steels, however, involves inclusions and second-phase particles [1, 25, 26].
Figure 5.21 illustrates the mechanism of cleavage nucleation in ferritic steels. The macroscopic
crack provides a local stress and strain concentration. A second-phase particle, such as a carbide orinclusion, cracks because of the plastic strain in the surrounding matrix. At this point the microcrackcan be treated as a Grifﬁth crack (Section 2.3). If the stress ahead of the macroscopic crack is sufﬁcient,the microcrack propagates into the ferrite matrix, causing failure by cleavage. For example, if theparticle is spherical and it produces a penny-shaped crack, the fracture stress is given by
(5.17)
where 
γp is the plastic work required to create a unit area of fracture surface in the ferrite and Co is
the particle diameter. It is assumed that γp >> γs, where γs is the surface energy (c.f. Equation (2.21)).
Note that the stress ahead of the macrocrack is treated as a remote stress in this case.
Consider the hypothetical material described earlier, where σYS = 400 MPa and E  = 210,000 MPa.
Knott [1] has estimated γp = 14 J/m2 for ferrite. Setting σf = 3 σYS and solving for critical particle
diameter yields Co = 7.05 µm. Thus the Grifﬁth criterion can be satisﬁed with relatively small
particles.
The nature of the microstructural feature that nucleates cleavage depends on the alloy and heat
treatment. In mild steels, cleavage usually initiates at grain boundary carbides [1, 25, 26]. Inquenched and tempered alloy steels, the critical feature is usually either a spherical carbide or aninclusion [1, 27]. Various models have been developed to explain the relationship between cleavagefracture stress and microstructure; most of these models resulted in expressions similar to Equation (5.18).Smith [26] proposed a model for cleavage fracture that considers stress concentration due to adislocation pile-up at a grain boundary carbide. The resulting failure criterion is as follows:

where Co, in this case, is the carbide thickness, and τi and ky are the friction stress and pile-up
constant, respectively, as deﬁned in the Hall-Petch equation:
(5.19)
where τy is the yield strength in shear. The second term on the left side of Equation (5.18) contains
the dislocation contribution to cleavage initiation. If this term is removed, Equation (5.18) reduces
to the Grifﬁth relationship for a grain boundary microcrack.
Figure 5.22 shows SEM fractographs that give examples of cleavage initiation from a grain
boundary carbide (a) and an inclusion at the interior of a grain (b). In both cases, the fracture originwas located by following river patterns on the fracture surface.
Susceptibility to cleavage fracture is enhanced by almost any factor that increases the yield
strength, such as low temperature, a triaxial stress state, radiation damage, high strain rate, andstrain aging. Grain size reﬁnement not only increases the yield strength but also increases 
σf.. There
are a number of reasons for the grain size effect. In mild steels, a decrease in grain size impliesan increase in the grain boundary area, which leads to smaller grain boundary carbides and anincrease in 
σf. In ﬁne-grained steels, the critical event may be the propagation of the microcrack
across the ﬁrst grain boundary it encounters. In such cases, the Grifﬁth model implies the followingexpression for fracture stress:
(5.20)
where 
γgb is the plastic work per unit area required to propagate into the adjoining grains. Since
there tends to be a high degree of mismatch between grains in a polycrystalline material, γgb > γp.
Equation (5.20) assumes an equiaxed grain structure. For martensitic and bainitic microstructures,Dolby and Knott [28] derived a modiﬁed expression for 
σf based on the packet diameter.
In some cases cleavage nucleates, but total fracture of the specimen or structure does not occur.
Figure 5.23 illustrates three examples of unsuccessful cleavage events. Part (a) shows a microcrackthat has arrested at the particle–matrix interface. The particle cracks due to strain in the matrix,but the crack is unable to propagate because the applied stress is less than the required fracturestress. This microcrack does not reinitiate because subsequent deformation and dislocation motionin the matrix causes the crack to blunt. Microcracks must remain sharp in order for the stress onthe atomic level to exceed the cohesive strength of the material. If a microcrack in a particlepropagates into the ferrite matrix, it may arrest at the grain boundary, as illustrated in Figure 5.23(b).This corresponds to a case where Equation (5.20) governs cleavage. Even if a crack successfullypropagates into the surrounding grains, it may still arrest if there is a steep stress gradient aheadof the macroscopic crack (Figure 5.23(c)). This tends to occur at low applied K
I values. Locally,
the stress is sufﬁcient to satisfy Equation (5.18) and Equation (5.20) but there is insufﬁcient globaldriving force to continue the crack propagation. Figure 5.24 shows an example of arrested cleavagecracks in front of a macroscopic crack in a spherodized 1008 steel [29].
5.2.3 M ATHEMATICAL  MODELS  OF CLEAVAGE  FRACTURE  TOUGHNESS
A difﬁculty emerges when trying to predict fracture toughness from Equation (5.18) to Equation (5.20).The maximum stress ahead of a macroscopic crack occurs at approximately 2
δ from the crack tip,
but the absolute value of this stress is constant in small-scale yielding (Figure 5.14); the distancefrom the crack tip at which this stress occurs increases with increasing  K, J, and 
δ. Thus, if attaining
a critical fracture stress were a sufﬁcient condition for cleavage fracture, the material might failupon the application of an inﬁnitesimal load, because the stresses would be high near the cracktip. Since ferritic materials have ﬁnite toughness, the attainment of a critical stress ahead of thecrack tip is apparently necessary but not sufﬁcient.ττyi ykd =+−12/

Ritchie, Knott, and Rice (RKR) [30] introduced a simple model to relate fracture stress to
fracture toughness, and to explain why steels did not spontaneously fracture upon the application
of a minimal load. They postulated that cleavage failure occurs when the stress ahead of the cracktip exceeds 
σf over a characteristic distance, as illustrated in Figure 5.25. They inferred σf in a mild
steel from blunt-notched four-point bend specimens and measured KIc with conventional fracture
toughness specimens. They inferred the crack-tip stress ﬁeld from a ﬁnite element solution publishedby Rice and Tracey [31]. They found that the characteristic distance was equal to two grain diametersFIGURE 5.22 SEM fractographs of cleavage initiation in an A 508 Class 3 alloy: (a) initiation at a grain

for the material they tested. Ritchie et al. argued that if fracture initiates in a grain boundary carbide
and propagates into a ferrite grain, the stress must be sufﬁcient to propagate the cleavage crack acrossthe opposite grain boundary and into the next grain; thus 
σf must be exceeded over one or two grain
diameters. Subsequent investigations [27, 32, 33], however, revealed no consistent relationshipbetween the critical distance and grain size.
Curry and Knott [34] provided a statistical explanation for the RKR critical distance. A ﬁnite
volume of material must be sampled ahead of the crack tip in order to ﬁnd a particle that is sufﬁcientlylarge to nucleate cleavage. Thus, a critical sample volume over which 
σYY ≥ σf is required for failure.
The critical volume, which can be related to a critical distance, depends on the average spacing ofcleavage nucleation sites.
The statistical argument also explains why cleavage fracture toughness data tend to be
widely scattered. Two nominally identical specimens made from the same material may displayvastly different toughness values because the location of the critical fracture-triggering particleis random. If one specimen samples a large fracture-triggering particle near the crack tip, whilethe fracture trigger in the other specimen is further from the crack tip, the latter specimen willdisplay a higher fracture toughness, because a higher load is required to elevate the stress atthe particle to a critical value. The statistical nature of fracture also leads to an apparentthickness effect on toughness. A thicker specimen is more likely to sample a large fracturetrigger along the crack front, and therefore will have a lower toughness than a thin specimen,on average [36–38].
The Curry and Knott approach was followed by more formal statistical models for cleavage
[29, 37– 40]. These models all treated cleavage as a weakest link phenomenon, where the probabilityof failure is equal to the probability of sampling at least one critical fracture-triggering particle.For a volume of material V, with 
ρ critical particles per unit volume, the probability of failure can
be inferred from the Poisson distribution:
(5.21)
The second term is the probability of ﬁnding zero critical particles in V, so F is the probability of
sampling one or more critical particles. The Poisson distribution can be derived from the binomialFIGURE 5.25 The Ritchie-Knott-Rice model for cleavage fracture. Failure is assumed to occur when the

distribution by assuming that ρ is small and V is large, an assumption that is easily satisﬁed in the
present problem.2 The critical particle size depends on stress, as Equation (5.17), Equation (5.18),
and Equation (5.20) indicate. In cases where stress varies with position, such as near the tip of a
crack, ρ must also vary with position. In such instances, the failure probability must be integrated
over individual volume elements ahead of the crack tip:
(5.22)
Consider a uniformly stressed sample of volume Vo. A two-parameter Weibull distribution [41]
can be used to represent the statistical variation of the fracture stress:
(5.23)
where m and σu are material constants. Comparing Equation (5.21) and Equation (5.23), we see that
(5.24)
When stress varies with position, the cumulative fracture probability can be expressed in terms ofan integral of maximum principal stress over volume, which can then be equated to an equivalentfracture stress:
(5.25)
where
V
f = volume of the fracture process zone in the geometry of interest
Vo = reference volume
σw = Weibull stress  [41]
The Weibull stress can be viewed as the equivalent fracture stress for uniform loading on a samplewith volume V
o. Solving for Weibull stress gives
(5.26)
The fracture process zone is deﬁned as the region where the stresses are sufﬁciently high for arealistic probability of cleavage.
Let us now consider the special case of a cracked body subject to applied loading. Assuming 
ρ
depends only on the local stress ﬁeld, and the crack-tip conditions are uniquely deﬁned by  K or J ,

it can be shown (Appendix 5) that the critical values of  K and J  follow a characteristic distribution
when failure is controlled by a weakest link mechanism:3
(5.27a)
or
(5.27b)
where ΘK and ΘJ are the material properties that depend on microstructure and temperature. Note that
Equation (5.22a) and Equation (5.22b) have the form of a two-parameter Weibull distribution. The
Weibull-shape parameter, which is sometimes called the Weibull slope, is equal to 4.0 for  KIc data and
(because of the relationship between  K and J ) 2.0 for Jc values for cleavage. The Weibull-scale
parameters ΘK and ΘJ are the 63rd percentile values of KIc and Jc, respectively. If ΘK or ΘJ is known,
the entire fracture toughness distribution can be inferred from Equation (5.27a) or Equation (5.27b).
The prediction of a fracture toughness distribution that follows a two-parameter Weibull
function with a known slope is an important result. The Weibull slope is a measure of the relativescatter; a prior knowledge of the Weibull slope enables the relative scatter to be predicted a priori ,
as Example 5.1 illustrates.
EXAMPLE 5.1
Determine the relative size of the 90% conﬁdence bounds of  KIc and Jc data, assuming Equation (5.27a)
and Equation (5.27b) describe the respective distributions.
Solution : The median, 5% lower bound, and 95% upper bound values are obtained by setting F = 0.5,
0.05, and 0.95, respectively, in Equation (5.27a) and Equation (5.27b). Both equations have the form:
Solving for λ at each probability level gives
λ0.50 = 0.693, λ0.05 = 0.0513, λ0.95 = 2.996
The width of the 90% conﬁdence band in KIc data, normalized by the median, is given by
and the relative width of the Jc scatter band is
Note that ΘK and ΘJ cancel out of the above results and the relative scatter depends only on the Weibull
slope.
3 Equation (5.27a) and Equation (5.27b) apply only when the thickness (i.e., the crack front length) is ﬁxed. The weakest
link model predicts a thickness effect, which is described in Appendix 5.2 but is omitted here for brevity.FKIc

244 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
There are two major problems with the weakest link model that leads to Equation (5.27a) and
Equation (5.27b). First, these equations predict zero as the minimum toughness in the distribution.
Intuition suggests that such a prediction is incorrect, and more formal arguments can be made fora nonzero threshold toughness. A crack cannot propagate in a material unless there is sufﬁcientenergy available to break bonds and perform plastic work. If the material is a polycrystal, additionalwork must be performed when the crack crosses randomly oriented grains. Thus, one can make anestimate of threshold toughness in terms of energy release rate:
(5.28)
where 
φ is a grain misorientation factor. If the global driving force is less than Gc(min ), the crack
cannot propagate. The threshold toughness can also be viewed as a crack arrest value: a crackcannot propagate if K
I < KIA.
A second problem with Equation (5.27a) and Equation (5.27b) is that they tend to overpredict
the experimental scatter. That is, scatter in experimental cleavage fracture toughness data is usuallyless severe than predicted by the weakest link model.
According to the weakest link model, failure is controlled by the initiation of cleavage in the
ferrite as the result of the cracking of a critical particle, i.e., a particle that satisﬁes Equation (5.17)or Equation (5.18). While weakest link initiation is necessary, it is apparently not sufﬁcient fortotal failure. A cleavage crack, once initiated, must have a sufﬁcient driving force to propagate.Recall Figure 5.22, which gives examples of unsuccessful cleavage events.
Both problems, threshold toughness and scatter, can be addressed by incorporating a conditional
probability of propagation into the statistical model [42, 43]. Figure 5.26 is a probability tree forcleavage initiation and propagation. When a ﬂawed structure is subject to an applied  K, a microcrack
may or may not initiate, depending on the temperature as well as the location of the eligible cleavagetriggers. The initiation of cleavage cracks should be governed by a weakest link mechanism, because theprocess involves searching for a large enough trigger to propagate a microcrack into the ﬁrst ferrite grain.

Fracture Mechanisms in Metals 245
Once cleavage initiates, the crack may either propagate in an unstable fashion or arrest, as in Figure 5.23.
Initiation is governed by the local stress at the critical particle, while propagation is controlled by theorientation of the neighboring grains and the global driving force. The overall probability of failure isequal to the probability of initiation times the conditional probability of propagation.
This model assumes that if a microcrack arrests, it does not contribute to subsequent failure. This
is a reasonable assumption, since only a rapidly propagating crack is sufﬁciently sharp to give the stressintensiﬁcation necessary to break bonds. Once a microcrack arrests, it is blunted by local plastic ﬂow.
Consider the case where the conditional probability of propagation is a step function:
That is, assume that all cracks arrest when K
I < Ko and that a crack propagates if KI ≥ Ko at the
time of initiation. This assumption implies that the material has a crack-arrest toughness that issingle valued. It can be shown (see Appendix 5.2) that such a material exhibits the following fracturetoughness distribution on  K values:
for K
I > Ko (5.29a)
for KI ≤ Ko (5.29b)
Equation (5.24) is a truncated Weibull  distribution; ΘK can no longer be interpreted as the 63rd
percentile KIc value. Note that a threshold has been introduced, which removes one of the
shortcomings of the weakest link model. Equation (5.24) also exhibits less scatter than the two-parameter distribution (Equation 5.22a), thereby removing the other objection to the weakestlink model.
The threshold is obvious in Equation (5.29), but the reduction in relative scatter is less so. The
latter effect can be understood by considering the limiting cases of Equation (5.24). If K
o/ΘK >> 1,
there are ample initiation sites for cleavage, but the microcracks cannot propagate unless KI > Ko.
Once KI exceeds Ko, the next microcrack to initiate will cause total failure. Since initiation events
are frequent in this case,  KIc values will be clustered near Ko, and the scatter will be minimal. On
the other hand, if Ko/ΘK << 1, Equation (5.29) reduces to the weakest link case. Thus the relative
scatter decreases as Ko/ΘK increases.
Equation (5.24) is an oversimpliﬁcation, because it assumes a single-valued crack-arrest tough-
ness. In reality, there is undoubtedly some degree of randomness associated with microscopic crackarrest. When a cleavage crack initiates in a single ferrite grain, the probability of propagation intothe surrounding grains depends in part on their relative orientation; a high degree of mismatchincreases the likelihood of arrest at the grain boundary. Anderson et al. [43] performed a probabilisticsimulation of microcrack propagation and arrest in a polycrystalline solid. Initiation in a singlegrain ahead of the crack tip was assumed, and the tilt and twist angles at the surrounding grainswere allowed to vary randomly (within the geometric constraints imposed by assuming {100}cleavage planes). An energy-based propagation criterion, suggested by the work of Gell and Smith[44], was applied. The conditional probability of propagation was estimated over a range of appliedK
I values. The results ﬁt an offset power law expression:

where α and β are material constants. Incorporating Equation (5.30) into the overall probability
analysis leads to a complicated distribution function that is very difﬁcult to apply to experimental
data (see Appendix 5.2). Stienstra and Anderson found, however, that this new function could beapproximated by a three-parameter Weibull distribution:
(5.31)
where K
min is the Weibull location parameter. 
Figure 5.27 shows experimental cleavage fracture toughness data for a low-alloy steel. Critical
J values measured experimentally were converted to equivalent KIc data. The data were corrected
for constraint loss through an analysis developed by Anderson and Dodds [45] (see Section 3.6.1).Equation (5.27a), Equation (5.29), and Equation (5.31) were ﬁt to the experimental data. Thethree-parameter Weibull distribution obviously gives the best ﬁt. The weakest link model(Equation (5.27a)) overestimates the scatter, while the truncated Weibull distribution does notfollow the data in the lower tail, presumably because the assumption of a single-valued arresttoughness is incorrect.
Wallin [46] has extended the Anderson et al. [45] model to show that the three-parameter
Weibull distribution of Equation (5.31) implies a probability of propagation of the following form:

5.3 THE DUCTILE-BRITTLE TRANSITION
The fracture toughness of ferritic steels can change drastically over a small temperature range,
as Figure 5.28 illustrates. At low temperatures, steel is brittle and fails by cleavage. At hightemperatures, the material is ductile and fails by microvoid coalescence. Ductile fracture initiatesat a particular toughness value, as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 5.28. The crack growsas the load is increased. Eventually, the specimen fails by plastic collapse or tearing instability.In the transition region between ductile and brittle behavior, both micromechanisms of fracturecan occur in the same specimen. In the lower transition region, the fracture mechanism is purecleavage, but the toughness increases rapidly with temperature as cleavage becomes more difﬁ-cult. In the upper transition region, a crack initiates by microvoid coalescence but ultimate failureoccurs by cleavage. On initial loading in the upper transition region, cleavage does not occurbecause there are no critical particles near the crack tip. As the crack grows by ductile tearing,however, more material is sampled. Eventually, the growing crack samples a critical particle andcleavage occurs. Because the fracture toughness in the transition region is governed by thesestatistical sampling effects, the data tend to be highly scattered. Wallin [47] has developed astatistical model for the transition region that incorporates the effect of prior ductile tearing onthe cleavage probability.
Recent work by Heerens and Read [27] demonstrates the statistical sampling nature of
cleavage fracture in the transition region. They performed a large number of fracture toughnesstests on a quenched and tempered alloy steel at several temperatures in the transition region. Asexpected, the data at a given temperature were highly scattered. Some specimens failed withoutsigniﬁcant stable crack growth, while other specimens sustained high levels of ductile tearingprior to cleavage. Heerens and Read examined the fracture surface of each specimen to determineFIGURE 5.28 The ductile-brittle transition in ferritic steels. The fracture mechanism changes from cleavage
to microvoid coalescence as the temperature increases.

the site of cleavage initiation. The measured distance from the initiation site to the original crack
tip correlated very well with the measured fracture toughness. In specimens that exhibitedlow toughness, this distance was small; a critical nucleus was available near the crack tip. Inspecimens that exhibited high toughness, there were no critical particles near the crack tip; thecrack had to grow and sample additional material before a critical cleavage nucleus was found.Figure 5.29 is a plot of fracture toughness vs. the critical distance r
c, which Heerens and Read
measured from the fracture surface; rc is deﬁned as the distance from the fatigue crack tip to the
cleavage initiation site. The resistance curve for ductile crack growth is also shown in this plot.In every case, cleavage initiated near the location of the maximum tensile stress (c.f. Figure5.14). Similar fractographic studies by Watanabe et al. [33] and Rosenﬁeld and Shetty [48] alsorevealed a correlation between J
c, ∆a, and rc.
Cleavage propagation in the upper transition region often displays isolated islands of ductile
fracture [23, 49]. When specimens with arrested macroscopic cleavage cracks are studied metallo-graphically, unbroken ligaments are sometimes discovered behind the arrested crack tip. These twoobservations imply that a propagating cleavage crack in the upper transition region encountersbarriers, such as highly misoriented grains or particles, through which the crack cannot propagate.The crack is diverted around these obstacles, leaving isolated unbroken ligaments in its wake. Asthe crack propagation continues, and the crack faces open, the ligaments that are well-behind thecrack tip rupture. Figure 5.30 schematically illustrates this postulated mechanism. The energyrequired to rupture the ductile ligaments may provide the majority of the propagation resistance acleavage crack experiences. The concentration of ductile ligaments on a fracture surface increaseswith temperature [49], which may explain why crack-arrest toughness ( K
Ia) exhibits a steep brittle-
ductile transition, much like KIc and Jc.FIGURE 5.29 Relationship between cleavage fracture toughness and the distance between the crack tip and
the cleavage trigger. Taken from Heerens, J. and Read, D.T., ‘‘Fracture Behavior of a Pressure Vessel Steel

5.4 INTERGRANULAR FRACTURE
In most cases metals do not fail along grain boundaries. Ductile metals usually fail by the coales-
cence of voids formed at inclusions and second-phase particles, while brittle metals typically failby transgranular cleavage. Under special circumstances, however, cracks can form and propagatealong grain boundaries.
There is no single mechanism for intergranular fracture. Rather, there are a variety of situations
that can lead to cracking on grain boundaries, including:
1. Precipitation of a brittle phase on the grain boundary.2. Environmental assisted cracking.3. Intergranular corrosion.
4. Grain boundary cavitation and cracking at high temperatures.
Space limitations preclude discussing each of these mechanisms in detail. A brief description ofthe intergranular cracking mechanisms is given below. Chapter 11 provides an overview of envi-ronmental cracking.
Brittle phases can be deposited on the grain boundaries of steel through improper tempering
[50]. Tempered martensite embrittlement, which results from tempering near 350 °C, and temper
embrittlement, which occurs when an alloy steel is tempered at ∼550°C, both apparently involve
the segregation of impurities such as phosphorous and sulfur, to prior austenite grain boundaries.These thin layers of impurity atoms are not resolvable on the fracture surface, but can be detectedwith surface analysis techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy. Segregation of aluminumnitride particles on grain boundaries during solidiﬁcation is a common embrittlement mechanismin cast steels [50]. Aluminum nitride, if present in sufﬁcient quantity, can also contribute to thedegradation of toughness resulting from temper embrittlement in wrought alloys.
Environmental cracking can occur in a range of material/environment combinations. In some
cases, crack propagation is directly attributable to a corrosion reaction at the crack tip; that is, thematerial at the crack tip selectively corrodes. In other instances, crack propagation is due to hydrogenembrittlement. In both cases, high stresses at the crack tip promote crack propagation. TheseFIGURE 5.30 Schematic illustration of cleavage crack propagation in the ductile-brittle transition region.
Ductile ligaments rupture behind the crack tip, resulting in increased propagation resistance.

250 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
environmental cracking mechanisms are discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Figure 5.31 shows an
intergranular fracture surface in a steel weld that was in contact with an ammonia environment.
Intergranular corrosion involves the preferential attack of the grain boundaries, as opposed to
general corrosion, where the material is dissolved relatively uniformly across the surface. Inter-granular attack is different from environmental assisted cracking, in that an applied stress is notnecessary for grain boundary corrosion.
At high temperatures, grain boundaries are weak relative to the matrix, and a signiﬁcant portion
of creep deformation is accommodated by grain-boundary sliding. In such cases void nucleationand growth (at second-phase particles) is concentrated at the crack boundaries, and cracks form asgrain boundary cavities grow and coalesce. Grain-boundary cavitation is the dominant mechanismof creep crack growth in metals [51], and it can be characterized with time-dependent parameterssuch as the C
* integral (see Chapter 4).
.
APPENDIX 5: STATISTIC AL MODELING OF CLEA VAGE FRACTURE
When one assumes that fracture occurs by a weakest link mechanism under  J-controlled conditions,
it is possible to derive a closed-form expression for the fracture-toughness distribution. Whenweakest link initiation is necessary but not sufﬁcient for cleavage fracture, the problem becomessomewhat more complicated, but it is still possible to describe the cleavage process mathematically.
A5.1 W EAKEST  LINK FRACTURE
As discussed in Section 5.2, the weakest link model for cleavage assumes that failure occurswhen at least one critical fracture-triggering particle is sampled by the crack tip.  Equation(5.22) describes the failure probability in this case.
4 Since cleavage is stress controlled, theFIGURE 5.31 Intergranular fracture in a steel ammonia tank. Photograph courtesy of W.L. Bradley.
4 It turns out that Equation (5.22) is valid even when the Poisson assumption is not applicable [40]; the quantity ρ is not
the microcrack density in such cases but ρ is uniquely related  to microcrack density. Thus, the derivation of the fracture-
toughness distribution presented in this section does not hinge on the Poisson assumption. 
1656_C005.fm  Page 250  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:47 PM
Fracture Mechanisms in Metals 251
microcrack density (i.e., the number of critical microcracks per unit volume) should depend
only on the maximum principal stress.5
(A5.1)
This quantity must be integrated over the volume ahead of the crack tip. In order to perform thisintegration, it is necessary to relate the crack-tip stresses to the volume sampled at each stress level.
Recall Section 3.5, where dimensional analysis indicated that the stresses ahead of the crack tip
in the limit of small-scale yielding are given by
(A5.2)
assuming Young’s modulus is ﬁxed in the material and thus does not need to be included in thedimensional analysis. Equation (A5.2) can be inverted to solve for the distance ahead of the cracktip (at a given angle) which corresponds to a particular stress value:
(A5.3)
By ﬁxing 
σ1 and varying θ from  −π to +π, we can construct a contour of constant principal stress,
as illustrated in Figure A5.1. The area inside this contour is given by
(A5.4)
where h is a dimensionless integration constant:
(A5.5)FIGURE A5.1 Deﬁnition of r, θ, and area for a prin-
cipal stress contour.
5 Although this derivation assumes that the maximum principal stress at a point controls the incremental cleavage probability,
the same basic result can be obtained by inserting any stress component into Equation (A5.1). For example, one might
assume that the tangential stress σθθ governs cleavage.

252 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
For plane strain conditions in an edge-cracked test specimen, the volume sampled at a given stress
value is simply BA, where B is the specimen thickness. Therefore, the incremental volume at a
ﬁxed J  and σo is given by
(A5.6)
Inserting Equation (A5.1) and Equation (A5.6) into Equation (5.21) gives
(A5.7)
here σmax is the peak value of stress that occurs ahead of the crack tip and σu is the threshold
fracture stress, which corresponds to the largest fracture-triggering particle the material is likelyto contain.
Note that J appears outside of the integral in Equation (A5.7). By setting  J = J
c in Equation (A5.7),
we obtain an expression for the statistical distribution of critical  J values, which can be written in
the following form:
(A5.8)
where Bo is a reference thickness. When B = Bo, ΘJ is the 63rd percentile Jc value. Equation (A5.8)
has the form of a two-parameter Weibull distribution, as discussed in Section 5.2.3. Invoking therelationship between  K and J  for small-scale yielding gives
(A5.9)
Equation (A5.8) and Equation (A5.9) both predict a thickness effect on toughness. The average
toughness is proportional to  for critical  J values and B
−0.25 for KIc data. The average toughness
does not increase indeﬁnitely with thickness, however. There are limits to the validity of the weakestlink model, as discussed in the next section.
All of the above relationships are valid only when weakest link failure occurs under  J-controlled
conditions, i.e., the single-parameter assumption must apply. When the constraint relaxes, criticalJ values no longer follow a Weibull distribution with a speciﬁc slope, but the effective small-scaleyielding  J values,  J
o (see Section 3.6.3), follow Equation (A5.8) if a weakest link mechanism
controls failure. Actual Jc values would be more scattered than Jo values, however, because the
ratio J/Jo increases with  J.
A5.2 I NCORPORATING  A CONDITIONAL  PROBABILITY
OF PROPAGATION
In many materials, the weakest link initiation of cleavage appears to be necessary but not sufﬁcient.Figure 5.26 schematically illustrates a probability tree for cleavage initiation and propagation. Thisdiagram is a slight oversimpliﬁcation, because the cumulative failure probability must be computedincrementally.
Modifying the statistical cleavage model to account for propagation requires that the probability
be expressed in terms of a hazard function  [52], which deﬁnes the instantaneous risk of fracture.dVBJ hd

Fracture Mechanisms in Metals 253
For a random variable T, the hazard function H(T), and the cumulative probability are related as
follows:
(A5.10)
where To is the minimum value of T. By comparing Equation (A5.17) and Equation (A5.18), it can
easily be shown that the hazard function for the weakest link initiation, in terms of stress intensity,
is given by
(A5.11)
assuming B = Bo. The hazard function for total failure  is equal to Equation (A5.11) times the
conditional probability of failure:
(A5.12)
Thus, the overall probability of failure is given by
(A5.13)
Consider the case where Ppr is a constant, i.e., it does not depend on the applied  K. Suppose,
for example, that half of the carbides of a critical size have a favorable orientation with respect toa cleavage plane in a ferrite grain. The failure probability becomes
(A5.14)
In this instance, the ﬁnite propagation probability merely shifts the 63rd percentile toughness to ahigher value:
The shape of the distribution is unchanged, and the fracture process still follows a weakest link
model. In this case, the weak link is deﬁned as a particle that is greater than the critical size that
is also oriented favorably .
Deviations from the weakest link distribution occur when P
pr depends on the applied  K. If the
conditional probability of propagation is a step function
the fracture-toughness distribution becomes a truncated Weibull (Equation (5.24)); failure can occur
only when K  > Ko. The introduction of a threshold toughness also reduces the relative scatter, as
discussed in Section 5.2.3.FH TdT

Equation (5.24) implies that the arrest toughness is single valued; a microcrack always prop-
agates above Ko, but always arrests at or below Ko. Experimental data, however, indicate that arrest
can occur over a range of  K values. The data in Figure 5.27 exhibit a sigmoidal shape, while the
truncated Weibull is nearly linear near the threshold.
A computer simulation of cleavage propagation in a polycrystalline material [42, 43] resulted
in a prediction of Ppr as a function of the applied  K; these results ﬁt an offset power law expression
(Equation (5.25)). The absolute values obtained from the simulation are questionable, but the
predicted trend is reasonable. Inserting Equation (5.25) into Equation (A5.13) gives
(A5.15)
The integral in Equation (A5.15) has a closed-form solution, but it is rather lengthy. The abovedistribution exhibits a sigmoidal shape, much like the experimental data in Figure 5.27. Unfortu-nately, it is very difﬁcult to ﬁt experimental data to Equation (A5.22). Note that there are fourﬁtting parameters in this distribution: 
α, β, Ko, and ΘK. Even with fewer unknown parameters, the
form of Equation (A5.15) is not conducive to curve-ﬁtting because it cannot be linearized.
Equation (A5.15) can be approximated with a conventional three-parameter Weibull distribution
with the slope ﬁxed at 4 (Equation (5.26)). The latter expression also gives a reasonably good ﬁtof experimental data (Figure 5.27). The three-parameter Weibull distribution is sufﬁciently ﬂexibleto model a wide range of behavior. The advantage of Equation (5.26) is that there are only twoparameters to ﬁt (the Weibull-shape parameter is ﬁxed at 4.0) and it can be linearized. Wallin [46]has shown that Equation (5.26) is rigorously correct if P
pr is given by Equation (5.32).

Fracture Mechanisms
in Nonmetals 
Traditional structural metals such as steel and aluminum are being replaced with plastics, ceramics,
and composites in a number of applications. Engineering plastics have a number of advantages,including low cost, ease of fabrication, and corrosion resistance. Ceramics provide superior wearresistance and creep strength. Composites offer high strength/weight ratios, and enable engineersto design materials with speciﬁc elastic and thermal properties. Traditional nonmetallic materialssuch as concrete continue to see widespread use.
Nonmetals, like metals, are not immune to fracture. Recall from Chapter 1, the example of the
pinch clamping of a polyethylene pipe that led to time-dependent fracture. The so-called high-toughness ceramics that have been developed in recent years (Section 6.2) have lower toughnessthan even the most brittle steels. Relatively minor impact (e.g., an airplane mechanic accidentallydropping his wrench on a wing) can cause microscale damage in a composite material, which canadversely affect the subsequent performance. The lack of ductility of concrete (relative to steel)limits its range of application.
Compared with the fracture of metals, research into the fracture behavior of nonmetals is in
its infancy. Much of the necessary theoretical framework is not yet fully developed for nonmetals,and there are many instances where fracture mechanics concepts that apply to metals have beenmisapplied to other materials.
This chapter gives a brief overview of the current state of understanding of fracture and failure
mechanisms in selected nonmetallic structural materials. Although the coverage of the subject isfar from complete, this chapter should enable the reader to gain an appreciation of the diversefracture behavior that various materials can exhibit. The references listed at the end of the chapterprovide a wealth of information to those who desire a more in-depth understanding of a particularmaterial system. The reader should also refer to Chapter 8, which describes the current methodsfor fracture toughness measurements in nonmetallic materials.
Section 6.1 outlines the molecular structure and mechanical properties of polymeric materials,
and describes how these properties inﬂuence the fracture behavior. This section also includes adiscussion of the fracture mechanisms in polymer matrix composites. Section 6.2 considers fracturein ceramic materials, including the newest generation of ceramic composites. Section 6.3 addressesfracture in concrete and rock.
This chapter does not speciﬁcally address metal matrix composites, but these materials have
many features in common with polymer and ceramic matrix composites [1]. Also, the metal matrixin these materials should exhibit the fracture mechanisms described in Chapter 5. 
6.1ENGINEERING PLASTICS 
The fracture behavior of polymeric materials has only recently become a major concern, asengineering plastics have begun to appear in critical structural applications. In most consumerproducts made from polymers (e.g., toys, garbage bags, ice chests, lawn furniture, etc.), fracturemay be an annoyance, but it is not a signiﬁcant safety issue. Fracture in plastic natural gas pipingsystems or aircraft wings, however, can have dire consequences.
Several books devoted solely to the fracture and fatigue of plastics have been published in recent
years [2–6]. These references proved invaluable to the author in preparing Chapter 6 and Chapter 8.6

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Let us begin the discussion of fracture in plastics by reviewing some of the basic principles of
polymeric materials. 
6.1.1 S 
TRUCTURE 
  
AND 
 P 
ROPERTIES

OLYMERS 
A polymer is deﬁned as the union of two or more compounds called mers. The  
degree of
polymerization 
 is a measure of the number of these units in a given molecule. Typical engineering
plastics consist of very long chains, with the degree of polymerization on the order of several
thousand.
Consider polyethylene, a polymer with a relatively simple molecular structure. The building
block in this case is ethylene (C 
2 
H 
4 
), which consists of two carbon atoms joined by a double bond,
with two hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon atom. If sufﬁcient energy is applied to thiscompound, the double bond can be broken, resulting in two free radicals that can react with otherethylene groups:
The degree of polymerization (i.e., the length of the chain) can be controlled by the heat input,
catalyst, as well as reagents that may be added to aid the polymerization process. 
6.1.1.1Molecular Weight 
The molecular weight is a measure of the length of a polymer chain. Since there is typically adistribution of molecule sizes in a polymer sample, it is convenient to quantify an average molecularweight, which can be deﬁned in one of two ways. The  
number average 
 molecular weight is the
total weight divided by the number of molecules:
(6.1)
where  
N 
i 
 is the number of molecules with molecular weight  
M 
i 
. The number average molecular
weight attaches equal importance to all molecules, while the  
weight average 
 molecular weight
reﬂects the actual average weight of molecules by placing additional emphasis on the largermolecules:

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 
259 
These two measures of molecular weight are obviously identical if all the molecules in the sample
are of the same size, but the number average is usually lower than the weight average molecularweight. The  
polydispersity 
 is deﬁned as the ratio of these two quantities:
(6.3)
A narrow distribution of molecular weights implies a PD close to 1, while PD can be greater than20 in materials with broadly distributed molecule sizes. Both measures of molecular weight, aswell as the PD, inﬂuence the mechanical properties of a polymer. 
6.1.1.2 Molecular Structure 
The structure of polymer chains also has a signiﬁcant effect on the mechanical properties. Figure 6.1illustrates three general classiﬁcations of polymer chains: linear, branched, and cross-linked.  
Linear
polymers 
 are not actual straight lines; rather, the carbon atoms in a linear molecule form a single
continuous path from one end of the chain to the other. A  
branched polymer 
 molecule, as the name
suggests, contains a series of smaller chains that branch off from a main “backbone.” A  
cross-linked
polymer 
 consists of a network structure rather than linear chains. A highly cross-linked structure is
typical of  
thermoset polymers 
, while  
thermoplastics 
 consist of linear and branched chains.  
Elastomers 
typically have lightly cross-linked structures and are capable of large elastic strains.
Epoxies are the most common example of thermoset polymers. Typically, two compounds that
are in the liquid state at ambient temperature are mixed together to form an epoxy resin, whichsolidiﬁes into a cross-linked lattice upon curing. This process is irreversible; a thermoset cannotbe formed into another shape once it solidiﬁes.
Thermomechanical processes in thermoplastics are reversible, because these materials do not
form cross-linked networks. Thermoplastics become viscous upon heating, where they can be formedinto the desired shape. 
6.1.1.3 Cr ystalline and Amorphous Polymers 
Polymer chains can be packed tightly together in a regular pattern, or they can form randomentanglements. Materials that display the former conﬁguration are called crystalline polymers, whilethe disordered state corresponds to amorphous (glassy) polymers. Figure 6.2 schematically illus-trates crystalline and amorphous arrangements of polymer molecules.
The term  
crystalline 
 does not have the same meaning for polymers as for metals and ceramics.
A crystal structure in a metal or ceramic is a regular array of atoms with three-dimensionalsymmetry; all the atoms in a crystal have identical surroundings (except atoms that are adjacent to

a defect, such as a dislocation or vacancy). The degree of symmetry in a crystalline polymer,
however, is much lower, as Figure 6.2 illustrates.
Figure 6.3 illustrates the volume-temperature relationships in crystalline and amorphous thermo-
plastics. As a crystalline polymer cools from the liquid state, an abrupt decrease in volume occurs atthe melting temperature  
T 
m 
, and the molecular chains pack efﬁciently in response to the thermodynamic
drive to order into a crystalline state. The volume discontinuity at  
T 
m 
 resembles the behavior of crystalline
metals and ceramics. An amorphous polymer bypasses  
T 
m 
 upon cooling, and remains in a viscous state
until it reaches the glass transition temperature  
T 
g 
, at which time the relative motion of the molecules
becomes restricted. An amorphous polymer contains more free volume than the same material in thecrystalline state, and thus has a lower density. The glass transition temperature is sensitive to the coolingrate; rapid heating or cooling tends to increase  
T 
g 
, as Figure 6.3 indicates. 
Semicrystalline 
 polymers contain both crystalline and glassy regions. The relative fraction of each
state depends on a number of factors, including the molecular structure and cooling rate. Slow coolingprovides more time for the molecules to arrange themselves in an equilibrium crystal structure. 
6.1.1.4 V iscoelastic Behavior 
Polymers exhibit rate-dependent viscoelastic deformation, which is a direct result of their molecularstructure. Figure 6.4 gives a simpliﬁed view of viscoelastic behavior on the molecular level. Twoneighboring molecules, or different segments of a single molecule that is folded back upon itself,experience weak attractive forces called  
Van der Waals bonds 
. These secondary bonds resist any

external force that attempts to pull the molecules apart. The elastic modulus of a typical polymer
is signiﬁcantly lower than Young’s modulus for metals and ceramics, because the Van der Waalsbonds are much weaker than primary bonds. Deforming a polymer requires cooperative motionamong molecules. The material is relatively compliant if the imposed strain rate is sufﬁciently lowto provide molecules sufﬁcient time to move. At faster strain rates, however, the forced molecularmotion produces friction, and a higher stress is required to deform the material. If the load isremoved, the material attempts to return to its original shape, but molecular entanglements preventinstantaneous elastic recovery. If the strain is sufﬁciently large, yielding mechanisms occur, suchas crazing and shear deformation (see Section 6.6.2), and much of the induced strain is essentiallypermanent.
Section 4.3 introduced the relaxation modulus  
E 
( 
t 
), and the creep compliance  
D 
( 
t 
), which
describe the time-dependent response of viscoelastic materials. The relaxation modulus and creepcompliance can be obtained experimentally by ﬁxing the strain and stress, respectively:
, (6.4)
See Figure 4.19 for a schematic illustration of stress relaxation and creep experiments. For linearviscoelastic materials, 
1 
  
E 
( 
t 
) and  
D 
( 
t 
) are related through a hereditary integral (Equation (4.61)).
Figure 6.5(a) is a plot of the relaxation modulus vs. temperature at a ﬁxed time for a thermo-
plastic. Below  
T 
g 
, the modulus is relatively high, as molecular motion is restricted. At around  
T 
g 
,
the modulus (at a ﬁxed time) decreases rapidly, and the polymer exhibits a “leathery” behavior. Athigher temperatures, the modulus reaches a lower plateau, and the polymer is in a rubbery state.Natural and synthetic rubbers are merely materials whose glass transition temperature is belowroom temperature. 
2 
 If the temperature is sufﬁciently high, linear polymers lose virtually all their
load-carrying capacity and behave like a viscous ﬂuid. Highly cross-linked polymers, however,maintain a modulus plateau. 
FIGURE 6.4 
Schematic deformation of a polymer
chain. Secondary Van der Waals bonds between chain
segments resist forces that try to extend the molecule.

Linear viscoelastic materials do not, in general, have linear stress-strain curves (since the modulus is time dependent),
but display other characteristics of linear elasticity such as superposition. See Section 4.3.1 for a deﬁnition of linear
viscoelasticity.

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Figure 6.5(b) shows a curve with the same characteristic shape as Figure 6.5(a), but with a
ﬁxed temperature and varying time. At short times, the polymer is glassy, but exhibits leathery,
rubbery, and liquid behavior at sufﬁciently long times. Of course,  
short time 
 and  
long time 
 are
relative terms that depend on temperature. A polymer signiﬁcantly below  
T 
g 
 might remain in a
glassy state during the time frame of a stress relaxation test, while a polymer well above  
T 
g 
 may
pass through this state so rapidly that the glassy behavior cannot be detected.
The equivalence between high temperature and long times (i.e., the time-temperature superpo-
sition principle) led Williams, Landel, and Ferry [7] to develop a semiempirical equation thatcollapses data at different times onto a single modulus-temperature master curve. They deﬁned atime shift factor

6.1.1.5 Mechanical Analogs 
Simple mechanical models are useful for understanding the viscoelastic response of polymers. Three
such models are illustrated in Figure 6.6. The Maxwell model (Figure 6.6(a)) consists of a spring anda dashpot in series, where a dashpot is a moving piston in a cylinder of viscous ﬂuid. The V oigt model(Figure 6.6(b)) contains a spring and a dashpot in parallel. Figure 6.6(c) shows a combined Maxwell-V oigt model. In each case, the stress-strain response in the spring is instantaneous:
(6.6)
while the dashpot response is time dependent:
(6.7)
where  is the strain rate and  
η 
 is the ﬂuid viscosity in the dashpot. The temperature dependence
of  
η 
 can be described by an Arrhenius rate equation:

Note that the limiting value of creep strain in this model is σo/E, which corresponds to zero stress
on the dashpot. If the stress is removed, the strain recovers with time:
(6.13)
where  εo is the strain at t = 0, and zero time is deﬁned at the moment the load is removed.
Neither model describes all types of viscoelastic response. For example, the Maxwell model
does not account for viscoelastic recovery, because the strain in the dashpot is not reversed when
the stress is removed. The V oigt model cannot be applied to the stress relaxation case, becausewhen strain is ﬁxed in Equation (6.11), all of the stress is carried by the spring; the problem reducesto simple static loading, where both stress and strain remain constant.
If we combine the two models, however, we obtain a more realistic and versatile model of
viscoelastic behavior. Figure 6.6(c) illustrates the combined Maxwell-V oigt model. In this case, thestrains in the Maxwell and V oigt contributions are additive, and the stress carried by the Maxwellspring and dashpot is divided between the V oigt spring and dashpot. For a constant stress creeptest, combining Equation (6.9) and Equation (6.13) gives
(6.14)
All three models are oversimpliﬁcations of actual polymer behavior, but are useful for approximat-ing different types of viscoelastic response.˙εσ

6.1.2 Y IELDING  AND FRACTURE  IN POLYMERS
In metals, fracture and yielding are competing failure mechanisms. Brittle fracture occurs in materials
in which yielding is difﬁcult. Ductile metals, by deﬁnition, experience extensive plastic deformationbefore they eventually fracture. Low temperatures, high strain rates, and triaxial tensile stresses tendto suppress yielding and favor brittle fracture.
From a global point of view, the foregoing also applies to polymers, but the microscopic details
of yielding and fracture in plastics are different from metals. Polymers do not contain crystallo-graphic planes, dislocations, and grain boundaries; rather, they consist of long molecular chains.Section 2.1 states that fracture on the atomic level involves breaking bonds, and polymers are noexception. A complicating feature for polymers, however, is that two types of bond govern themechanical response: the covalent bonds between carbon atoms and the secondary van der Waalsforces between molecule segments. Ultimate fracture normally requires breaking the latter, but thesecondary bonds often play a major role in the deformation mechanisms that lead to fracture.
The factors that govern the toughness and ductility of polymers include the strain rate, tem-
perature, and molecular structure. At high rates or low temperatures (relative to T
g) polymers tend
to be brittle, because there is insufﬁcient time for the material to respond to stress with large-scaleviscoelastic deformation or yielding. Highly cross-linked polymers are also incapable of large-scaleviscoelastic deformation. The mechanism illustrated in Figure 6.4, where molecular chains over-come van der Waals forces, does not apply to cross-linked polymers; primary  bonds between chain
segments must be broken for these materials to deform.
6.1.2.1Chain Scission and Disentanglement
Fracture, by deﬁnition, involves material separation, which normally implies severing bonds. In
the case of polymers, fracture on the atomic level is called chain scission .
Recall from Chapter 2 that the theoretical bond strength in most materials is several orders of
magnitude larger than the measured fracture stresses, but crack-like ﬂaws can produce signiﬁcantlocal stress concentrations. Another factor that aids chain scission in polymers is that moleculesare not stressed uniformly. When a stress is applied to a polymer sample, certain chain segmentscarry a disproportionate amount of load, which can be sufﬁcient to exceed the bond strength. Thedegree of nonuniformity in stress is more pronounced in amorphous polymers, while the limiteddegree of symmetry in crystalline polymers tends to distribute stress more evenly.
Free radicals form when covalent bonds in polymers are severed. Consequently, chain scission
can be detected experimentally by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) and infrared spectros-copy [9, 10].
In some cases, fracture occurs by chain disentanglement , where molecules separate from one
another intact. The likelihood of chain disentanglement depends on the length of molecules andthe degree to which they are interwoven.
3
Chain scission can occur at relatively low strains in cross-linked or highly aligned polymers, but
the mechanical response of isotropic polymers with low cross-link density is governed by secondarybonds at low strains. At high strains, many polymers yield before fracture, as discussed below.
6.1.2.2Shear Yielding and Crazing
Most polymers, like metals, yield at sufﬁciently high stresses. While metals yield by dislocation
motion along slip planes, polymers can exhibit either shear yielding or crazing.
3 An analogy that should be familiar to most Americans is the process of disentangling Christmas tree lights that have been
stored in a box for a year. For those who are not acquainted with this holiday ritual, a similar example is a large mass of
tangled strands of string; pulling on a single strand will either free it (chain disentanglement) or cause it to break (chainscission). 1656_C006.fm  Page 265  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:50 PM
266 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Shear yielding in polymers resembles plastic ﬂow in metals, at least from a continuum mechan-
ics viewpoint. Molecules slide with respect to one another when subjected to a critical shear stress.
Shear-yielding criteria can either be based on the maximum shear stress or the octahedral shearstress [11, 12]:
(6.15a)
or
(6.15b)
where 
σm is the hydrostatic stress and µs is a material constant that characterizes the sensitivity of
the yield behavior to σm. When µs = 0, Equation (6.15a) and Equation (6.15b) reduce to the Tresca
and von Mises yield criteria, respectively.
Glassy polymers subject to tensile loading often yield by crazing, which is a highly localized
deformation that leads to cavitation (void formation) and strains on the order of 100% [13, 14].On the macroscopic level, crazing appears as a stress-whitened region , due to a low refractive index.
The craze zone usually forms perpendicular to the maximum principal normal stress.
Figure 6.7 illustrates the mechanism for crazing in homogeneous glassy polymers. At sufﬁ-
ciently high strains, molecular chains form aligned packets called ﬁbrils. Microvoids form betweenthe ﬁbrils due to an incompatibility of strains in neighboring ﬁbrils. The aligned structure enablesthe ﬁbrils to carry very high stresses relative to the undeformed amorphous state because covalentbonds are much stronger and stiffer than the secondary bonds. The ﬁbrils elongate by incorporatingadditional material, as Figure 6.7 illustrates. Figure 6.8 shows an SEM fractograph of a craze zone.
Oxborough and Bowden [15] proposed the following craze criterion:
(6.16)
where 
ε1 is the maximum principal normal strain, and β and γ are parameters that are time and
temperature dependent. According to this model, the critical strain for crazing decreases withincreasing modulus and hydrostatic stress.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 267
Fracture occurs in a craze zone when individual ﬁbrils rupture. This process can be unstable
if, when a ﬁbril fails, the redistributed stress is sufﬁcient to rupture one or more neighboring ﬁbrils.
Fracture in a craze zone usually initiates from inorganic dust particles that are entrapped in thepolymer [16]. There are a number of ways to neutralize the detrimental effects of these impurities,including the addition of soft second-phase particles.
Crazing and shear yielding are competing mechanisms; the dominant yielding behavior depends
on the molecular structure, stress state, and temperature. A large hydrostatic tensile component in thestress tensor is conducive to crazing, while shear yielding favors a large deviatoric stress component.Each yielding mechanism displays a different temperature dependence; thus the dominant mechanismmay change with temperature.
6.1.2.3 Crack-Tip Behavior
As with metals, a yield zone typically forms at the tip of a crack in polymers. In the case of shear
yielding, the damage zone resembles the plastic zone in metals, because slip in metals and shear inpolymers are governed by similar yield criteria. Craze yielding, however, produces a Dugdale-typestrip-yield zone ahead of the crack tip. Of the two yielding mechanisms in polymers, crazing issomewhat more likely ahead of a crack tip, because of the triaxial tensile stress state. Shear yielding,however, can occur at crack tips in some materials, depending on the temperature and specimengeometry [17].
Figure 6.9 illustrates a craze zone ahead of a crack tip. If the craze zone is small compared to
the specimen dimensions,
4 we can estimate its length ρ from the Dugdale-Barenblatt [18, 19]
strip-yield model:

which is a restatement of Equation (2.74), except that we have replaced the yield strength with σc,
the crazing stress. Figure 6.10 is a photograph of a crack-tip craze zone [17], which exhibits a
typical stress-whitening appearance.
The crack advances when the ﬁbrils at the trailing edge of the craze rupture. In other words,
cavities in the craze zone coalesce with the crack tip. Figure 6.11 is an SEM fractograph of thesurface of a polypropylene fracture toughness specimen that has experienced craze-crack growth.Note the similarity to fracture surfaces for microvoid coalescence in metals (Figure 5.3 andFigure 5.8).
Craze-crack growth can either be stable or unstable, depending on the relative toughness of the
material. Some polymers with intermediate toughness exhibit sporadic, so-called stick /slip crack
growth: at a critical crack-tip-opening displacement, the entire craze zone ruptures, the crack arrests,and the craze zone reforms at the new crack tip [3]. Stick/slip crack growth can also occur in materialsthat exhibit shear yield zones.
6.1.2.4Rubber Toughening
As stated earlier, the rupture of ﬁbrils in a craze zone can lead to unstable crack propagation.
Fracture initiates at inorganic dust particles in the polymer when the stress exceeds a critical value.It is possible to increase the toughness of a polymer by lowering the crazing stress to well belowthe critical fracture stress.FIGURE 6.9 Schematic crack-tip craze zone.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 269
The addition of rubbery second-phase particles to a polymer matrix signiﬁcantly increases
toughness by making craze initiation easier [16]. The low-modulus particles provide sites for void
nucleation, thereby lowering the stress required for craze formation. The detrimental effect of thedust particles is largely negated because the stress in the ﬁbrils tends to be well below that requiredfor fracture. Figure 6.12 is an SEM fractograph that shows crack growth in a rubber-toughenedpolymer. Note the high concentration of voids, compared to the fracture surface in Figure 6.11.FIGURE 6.11 Fracture surface of craze-crack growth in polypropylene. Photograph provided by Mr. Sun Yongqi.

270 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Of course there is a trade-off with rubber toughening, in that the increase in toughness and
ductility comes at the expense of yield strength. A similar trade-off between toughness and strength
often occurs in metals and alloys.
6.1.2.5 Fatigue
Time-dependent crack growth in the presence of cyclic stresses is a problem in virtually all material
systems. Two mechanisms control fatigue in polymers: chain scission and hysteresis heating [5].
Crack growth by chain scission occurs in brittle systems, where crack-tip yielding is limited.
A ﬁnite number of bonds are broken during each stress cycle, and measurable crack advance takesplace after sufﬁcient cycles.
Tougher materials exhibit signiﬁcant viscoelastic deformation and yielding at the crack tip. Figure 6.13
illustrates the stress-strain behavior of a viscoelastic material for a single load-unload cycle. Unlikeelastic materials, where the unloading and loading paths coincide and the strain energy is recovered,a viscoelastic material displays a hysteresis loop in the stress-strain curve; the area inside this looprepresents the energy that remains in the material after it is unloaded. When a viscoelastic materialis subject to multiple stress cycles, a signiﬁcant amount of work is performed on the material. Muchof this work is converted to heat, and the temperature in the material rises. The crack-tip region in apolymer subject to cyclic loading may rise to well above T
g, resulting in local melting and viscous
ﬂow of the material. The rate of crack growth depends on the temperature at the crack tip, which isgoverned by the loading frequency and the rate of heat conduction away from the crack tip. Fatiguecrack growth data from small laboratory coupons may not be applicable to structural componentsbecause heat transfer properties depend on the size and geometry of the sample.
6.1.3 F IBER-REINFORCED  PLASTICS
This section focuses on the fracture behavior of continuous ﬁber-reinforced plastics, as opposed toother types of polymer composites. The latter materials tend to be isotropic on the macroscopicscale, and their behavior is often similar to homogeneous materials. Continuous ﬁber-reinforcedplastics, however, have orthotropic mechanical properties that lead to unique failure mechanismssuch as delamination and microbuckling.
The combination of two or more materials can lead to a third material with highly desirable
properties. Precipitation-hardened aluminum alloys and rubber-toughened plastics are examples ofmaterials whose properties are superior to those of the parent constituents. While these materialsform “naturally” through careful control of chemical composition and thermal treatments, themanufacture of composite materials  normally involves a somewhat more heavy-handed human
intervention. The constituents of a composite material are usually combined on a macroscopic scalethrough physical rather than chemical means [20]. The distinction between composites and mul-tiphase materials is somewhat arbitrary, since many of the same strengthening mechanisms operatein both classes of material.FIGURE 6.13 Cyclic stress-strain curve in a viscoelas-
tic material. Hysteresis results in absorbed energy, which
is converted to heat.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 271
Composite materials usually consist of a matrix and a reinforcing constituent. The matrix is often
soft and ductile compared to the reinforcement, but this is not always the case (see Section 6.2).
Various types of reinforcement are possible, including continuous ﬁbers, chopped ﬁbers, whiskers,ﬂakes, and particulates [20].
When a polymer matrix is combined with a strong, high-modulus reinforcement, the resulting
material can have superior strength/weight and stiffness/weight ratios compared to steel andaluminum. Continuous ﬁber-reinforced plastics tend to give the best overall performance (com-pared to other types of polymer composites), but can also exhibit troubling fracture and damagebehavior. Consequently, these materials have been the subject of extensive research over the past40 years.
A variety of ﬁber-reinforced polymer composites are commercially available. The matrix material
is usually a thermoset polymer (i.e., an epoxy), although thermoplastic composites have becomeincreasingly popular in recent years. Two of the most common ﬁber materials are carbon, in theform of graphite, and aramid (also known by the trade name, Kevlar),
5 which is a high-modulus
polymer. Polymers reinforced by continuous graphite or Kevlar ﬁbers are intended for high-performance applications such as ﬁghter planes, while ﬁberglass  is an example of a polymer
composite that appears in more down-to-earth applications. The latter material consists of randomlyoriented chopped glass ﬁbers in a thermoset matrix.
Figure 6.14 illustrates the structure of a ﬁber-reinforced composite. Consider a single ply
(Figure 6.14(a)). The material has high strength and stiffness in the ﬁber direction, but has relativelypoor mechanical properties when loaded transverse to the ﬁbers. In the latter case, the strength andstiffness are controlled by the properties of the matrix. When the composite is subject to biaxialloading, several plies with differing ﬁber orientations can be bonded to form a laminated composite(Figure 6.14(b)). The individual plies interact to produce complex elastic properties in the laminate.The desired elastic response can be achieved through the appropriate choice of the ﬁber and matrixmaterial, the ﬁber volume, and the lay-up sequence of the plies. The fundamentals of orthotropicelasticity and laminate theory are well established [21].
6.1.3.1 Overview of Failure Mechanisms
Many have attempted to apply fracture mechanics to ﬁber-reinforced composites, and have met
with mixed success. Conventional fracture mechanics methodology assumes a single dominantcrack that grows in a self-similar fashion, i.e., the crack increases in size (either through stable orunstable growth), but its shape and orientation remain the same. Fracture of a ﬁber-reinforcedcomposite, however, is often controlled by numerous microcracks distributed throughout the mate-rial, rather than a single macroscopic crack. There are situations where fracture mechanics isappropriate for composites, but it is important to recognize the limitations of theories that wereintended for homogeneous materials.
Figure 6.15 illustrates various failure mechanisms in ﬁber-reinforced composites. One advan-
tage of composite materials is that fracture seldom occurs catastrophically without warning, buttends to be progressive, with subcritical damage widely dispersed through the material. Tensileloading (Figure 6.15 (a)) can produce matrix cracking, ﬁber bridging, ﬁber rupture, ﬁber pullout,and ﬁber/matrix debonding. Ultimate tensile failure of a ﬁber-reinforced composite often involvesseveral of these mechanisms. Out-of-plane stresses can lead to delamination (Figure 6.15 (b))because the ﬁbers do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the strength in this direction. Compressiveloading can produce the microbuckling of ﬁbers (Figure 6.15(c)); since the polymer matrix issoft compared to the ﬁbers, the ﬁbers are unstable in compression. Compressive loading can alsolead to macroscopic delamination buckling (Figure 6.15(d)), particularly if the material containsa preexisting delaminated region.

272 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
6.1.3.2 Delamination
Out-of-plane tensile stresses can cause failure between plies, as Figure 6.15(b) illustrates. Stresses
that lead to delamination could result from the structural geometry, such as if two composite panelsare joined in a “T” conﬁguration. Out-of-plane stresses, however, also arise from an unexpectedsource. Mismatch in Poisson’s ratios between plies results in shear stresses in the x-y plane near the
ply interface. These shear stresses produce a bending moment that is balanced by a stress in the z
direction. For some lay-up sequences, substantial out-of-plane tensile stresses occur at the edge ofthe panel, which can lead to the formation of a delamination crack. Figure 6.16 shows a computed
σz distribution for a particular lay-up [22].
Although the assumption of a self-similar growth of a dominant crack often does not apply to
the failure of composite materials, such an assumption is appropriate in the case of delamination.Consequently, fracture mechanics has been very successful in characterizing this failure mechanism.FIGURE 6.14 Schematic structure of ﬁber-reinforced composites.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 273
Delamination can occur in both Mode I and Mode II. The interlaminar fracture toughness,
which is usually characterized by a critical energy release rate (see Chapter 8), is related to the
fracture toughness of the matrix material. The matrix and composite toughness are seldom equal,however, due to the inﬂuence of the ﬁbers in the latter.
Figure 6.17 is a compilation of 
GIC values for various matrix materials, compared with the
interlaminar toughness of the corresponding composite [23]. For brittle thermosets, the compositehas a higher toughness than the neat resin, but the effect is reversed for high toughness matrices.Attempts to increase the composite toughness through tougher resins have yielded disappointingresults; only a fraction of the toughness of a high ductility matrix is transferred to the composite.
Let us ﬁrst consider the reasons for the high relative toughness of composites with brittle
matrices. Figure 6.18 shows the fracture surface in a composite specimen with a brittle epoxy resin.The crack followed the ﬁbers, implying that ﬁber/matrix debonding was the crack growth mecha-nism in this case. The fracture surface has a “corrugated roof” appearance; more surface area wasFIGURE 6.15 Examples of damage and fracture mechanisms in ﬁber-reinforced composites.

created in the composite experiment, which apparently resulted in higher fracture energy. Another
contributing factor in the composite toughness in this case is ﬁber bridging. In some instances, the crackgrows around a ﬁber, which then bridges the crack faces, and adds resistance to further crack growth.
With respect to the fracture of tough matrices, one possible explanation for the lower relative
toughness of the composite is that the latter is limited by the ﬁber/matrix bond, which is weakerthan the matrix material. Experimental observations, however, indicate that ﬁber constraint is amore likely explanation [24]. In high toughness polymers, a shear or craze damage zone formsahead of the crack-tip. If the toughness is sufﬁcient for the size of the damage zone to exceedthe ﬁber spacing, the ﬁbers restrain the crack-tip yielding, resulting in a smaller zone than in theneat resin. The smaller damage zone leads to a lower fracture energy between plies.
Delamination in Mode II loading is possible, but 
GIIC is typically 2 to 10 times higher than the
corresponding GIC [24]. The largest disparity between Mode I and Mode II interlaminar toughness occurs
in brittle matrices.
In-situ  fracture experiments in an SEM enable one to view the fracture process during delamination;
[24–26]. Long, slender damage zones containing numerous microcracks form ahead of the crack tipduring Mode II loading. Figure 6.19 shows a sequence of SEM fractographs of a Mode II damage zoneahead of an interlaminar crack in a brittle resin; the same region was photographed at different damagestates. Note that the microcracks are oriented approximately 45 ° from the main crack, which is subject
to Mode II shear. Thus the microcracks are oriented perpendicular to the maximum normal stress andare actually Mode I cracks. As the loading progresses, these microcracks coalesce with the main cracktip. The high relative toughness in Mode II results from energy dissipation in this damage zone.
In more ductile matrices, the appearance of the Mode II damage zone is similar to the
Mode  I case, and the difference between 
GIC and GIIC is not as large as for brittle matrices [24].
6.1.3.3 Compressive Failure
High-modulus ﬁbers provide excellent strength and stiffness in tension, but are of limited value
for compressive loading. According to the Euler buckling equation, a column of length L with aFIGURE 6.18 Fracture surface resulting from Mode I delamination of a graphite-epoxy composite with a

cross-section moment of inertia I, subject to a compressive force P, becomes unstable when
(6.18)
assuming the loading is applied on the central axis of the column and the ends are unrestrained.
Thus a long, slender ﬁber has very little load-carrying capacity in compression.
Equation (6.18) is much too pessimistic for composites, because the ﬁbers are supported by
matrix material. Early attempts [27] to model ﬁber buckling in composites incorporated an elasticfoundation into the Euler bucking analysis, as Figure 6.20 illustrates. This led to the followingcompressive failure criterion for unidirectional composites:
(6.19)
where 
µLT is the longitudinal-transverse shear modulus of the matrix and Ef is Young’s modulus of
the ﬁbers. This model overpredicts the actual compressive strength of composites by a factor of ∼4.
One problem with Equation (6.19) is that it assumes that the response of the material remains
elastic; matrix yielding is likely for large lateral displacements of ﬁbers. Another shortcoming of thissimple model is that it considers global ﬁber instability, while ﬁber buckling is a local phenomenon;microscopic kink bands form, usually at a free edge, and propagate across the panel [28, 29].

model to the problem. This model has been moderately successful in quantifying the size of the compressive damage zones.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 277
An additional complication in real composites is ﬁber waviness . Fibers are seldom perfectly
straight; rather they tend to have a sine wave-like proﬁle, as Figure 6.22 illustrates [30]. Such a
conﬁguration is less stable in compression than a straight column.
Recent investigators [30–32] have incorporated the effects of matrix nonlinearity and ﬁber waviness
into failure models. Most failure models are based on continuum theory and thus do not address thelocalized nature of microbuckling. Guynn [32], however, has performed detailed numerical simulationsof compression loading of ﬁbers in a nonlinear matrix.
Microbuckling is not the only mechanism for compressive failure. Figure 6.15(d) illustrates
buckling delamination, which is a macroscopic instability. This type of failure is common in com-posites that have been subject to impact damage, which produces microcracks and delaminationﬂaws in the material. Delamination buckling induces Mode I loading, which causes the delaminationﬂaw to propagate at sufﬁciently high loads. This delamination growth can be characterized withFIGURE 6.20 Compressive loading of a column that
is supported laterally by an elastic foundation.

fracture mechanics methodology [33]. A compression after impact  test is a common screening
criterion for assessing the ability of a material to withstand impact loading without sustaining
signiﬁcant damage.
6.1.3.4 Notch Strength
The strength of a composite laminate that contains a hole or a notch is less than the unnotched strength
because of the local stress concentration effect. A circular hole in an isotropic plate has a stressconcentration factor (SCF) of 3.0, and the SCF can be much higher for an elliptical notch (Section 2.2).If a composite panel with a circular hole fails when the maximum stress reaches a critical value, thestrength should be independent of the hole size, since the SCF does not depend on radius. Actualstrength measurements, however, indicate a hole size effect, where strength decreases with increasinghole size [34]. 
Figure 6.23 illustrates the elastic stress distributions ahead of a large hole and a small hole.
Although the peak stress is the same for both holes, the stress concentration effects of the largehole act over a wider distance. Thus the volume over which the stress acts appears to be important.
Whitney and Nuismer [35] proposed a simple model for notch strength, where failure is assumed
to occur when the stress exceeds the unnotched strength over a critical distance.
7 This distance is
a ﬁtting parameter that must be obtained by experiment. Subsequent modiﬁcations to this model,including the work of Pipes et. al. [36], yielded additional ﬁtting parameters, but did not result ina better understanding of the failure mechanisms.
Figure 6.24 shows the effect of notch length on the strength panels that contain elliptical center
notches [34]. These experimental data actually apply to a boron-aluminum composite, but polymercomposites exhibit a similar trend. The simple Whitney and Nuismer criterion gives a reasonablygood ﬁt of the data in this case.FIGURE 6.22 Fiber waviness in a graphite-epoxy composite. Photograph provided by A.L. Highsmith. Taken

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 279
Some researchers [37] have applied fracture mechanics concepts to the failure of composites
panels that contain holes and notches. They assume failure at a critical K, which is usually modiﬁed
with a plastic zone correction to account for subcritical damage. Some of these models are capable
of ﬁtting experimental data such as that in Figure 6.24, because the plastic zone correction is anadjustable parameter. The physical basis of these models is dubious, however. Fracture mechanicsformalism gives these models the illusion of rigor, but they have no more theoretical basis than thesimple strength-of-materials approaches such as the Whitney-Nuismer criterion.
That linear elastic fracture mechanics is invalid for circular holes and blunt notches in com-
posites should be self evident, since the LEFM theory assumes sharp cracks. If, however, a sharpslit is introduced into a composite panel (Figure 6.25), the validity (or lack of validity) of fracturemechanics is less obvious. This issue is explored below.
Recall Chapter 2, which introduced the concept of a singularity zone, where the stress and
strain vary as  from the crack tip. Outside of the singularity zone, higher-order terms, whichFIGURE 6.23 Effect of hole size on local stress dis-

are geometry dependent, become signiﬁcant. For K to deﬁne uniquely the crack-tip conditions and
be a valid failure criterion, all nonlinear material behavior must be conﬁned to a small region inside
the singularity zone. This theory is based entirely on continuum mechanics. While metals, plastics,and ceramics are often heterogeneous, the scale of microstructural constituents is normally smallcompared to the size of the singularity zone; thus the continuum assumption is approximately valid.
For LEFM to be valid for a sharp crack in a composite panel, the following conditions must
be met:
1. The ﬁber spacing must be small compared to the size of the singularity zone. Otherwise,
the continuum assumption is invalid.
2. Nonlinear damage must be conﬁned to a small region within the singularity zone.
Harris and Morris [38] showed that K characterizes the onset of damage in cracked specimens,
but not ultimate failure, because the damage spreads throughout the specimen before failure, andK no longer has any meaning. Figure 6.25 illustrates a typical damage zone in a specimen with asharp macroscopic notch. The damage, which includes ﬁber/matrix debonding and matrix cracking,actually propagates perpendicular to the macrocrack. Thus the crack does not grow in a self-similarfashion.
One of the most signiﬁcant shortcomings of tests on composite specimens with narrow slits is
that defects of this type do not occur naturally in ﬁber-reinforced composites; therefore, the geometryin Figure 6.25 is of limited practical concern. Holes and blunt notches may be unavoidable in a design,but a competent design engineer would not be foolish enough to include a sharp notch in a load-bearing member of a structure.
6.1.3.5 F atigue Damage
Cyclic loading of composite panels produces essentially the same type of damage as monotonic
loading. Fiber rupture, matrix cracking, ﬁber/matrix debonding, and delamination all occur inresponse to fatigue loading. Fatigue damage reduces the strength and modulus of a compositelaminate, and eventually leads to total failure.
Figure 6.26 and Figure 6.27 show the effect of cyclic stresses on the residual strength and modulus
of graphite/epoxy laminates [39]. Both strength and modulus decrease rapidly after relatively fewcycles, but remain approximately constant up to around 80% of the fatigue life. Near the end of thefatigue life, strength and modulus decrease further.

6.2 CERAMICS AND CERAMIC COMPOSITES
A number of technological initiatives have been proposed whose implementation depends on achieving
major advances in materials technology. For example, the National Aerospace Plane will re-enter theearth’s atmosphere at speeds of up to Mach 25, creating extremes of both temperature and stress. Also,the Advanced Turbine Technology Applications Program (ATTAP) has the stated goal of developingheat engines that have a service life of 3000 h at 1350 °C. Additional applications are on the horizon
that will require materials that can perform at temperatures in excess of 2000 °C. All metals, including
cobalt-based superalloys, are inadequate at these temperatures. Only ceramics possess adequate creepresistance above 1000 °C. 
Ceramic materials include oxides, carbides, sulﬁdes, and intermetallic compounds, which are
joined either by covalent or ionic bonds. Most ceramics are crystalline but, unlike metals, they donot have close-packed planes on which dislocation motion can occur. Therefore, ceramic materialstend to be very brittle compared to metals.
Typical ceramics have very high melting temperatures, which explains their good creep prop-
erties. Also, many of these materials have superior wear resistance, and have been used for bearingsand machine tools. Most ceramics, however, are too brittle for critical load-bearing applications.Consequently, a vast amount of research has been devoted to improving the toughness of ceramics.
Most traditional ceramics are monolithic (single phase) and have very low fracture toughness.
Because they do not yield, monolithic ceramics behave as ideally brittle materials (Figure 2.6(a)),and a propagating crack need only overcome the surface energy of the material. The new generationof ceramics, however, includes multiphase materials and ceramic composites that have vastlyimproved toughness. Under certain conditions, two brittle solids can be combined to produce amaterial that is signiﬁcantly tougher than either parent material.
The micromechanisms that lead to improved fracture resistance in modern ceramics include
microcrack toughening, transformation toughening, ductile phase toughening, ﬁber toughening, andwhisker toughening. Table 6.1 lists the dominant toughening mechanism in several materials, alongwith the typical fracture toughness values [40]. Fiber toughening, the most effective mechanism,produces toughness values around 20 , which is below the lower shelf toughness of steelsbut is signiﬁcantly higher than most ceramics.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 283
Evans [40] divides the toughening mechanisms for ceramics into two categories: process zone
formation and bridging. Both mechanisms involve energy dissipation at the crack tip. A third
mechanism, crack deﬂection, elevates toughness by increasing the area of the fracture surface(Figure 2.6(c)).
The process zone mechanism for toughening is illustrated in Figure 6.28. Consider a material
that forms a process zone at the crack tip (Figure 6.28(a)). When this crack propagates, it leavesa wake behind the crack tip. The critical energy release rate for propagation is equal to the workrequired to propagate the crack from a to a + da, divided by da:

case of uniaxial loading. Figure 6.28(b) compares the stress-strain curve of brittle and toughened
ceramics. The latter material is capable of higher strains, and absorbs more energy prior to failure.
Many toughened ceramics contain second-phase particles that are capable of nonlinear deformation,
and are primarily responsible for the elevated toughness. Figure 6.28(c) illustrates the process zone forsuch a material. Assuming the particles provide all of the energy dissipation in the process zone, andthe strain-energy density in this region does not depend on y, the fracture toughness is given by
(6.21)
where f is the volume fraction of second-phase particles. Thus the toughness is controlled by the
width of the process zone, the concentration of second-phase particles, and the area under thestress-strain curve. Recall the delamination of composites with tough resins (Section 6.1.3), wherethe fracture toughness of the composite was not as great as the neat resin because the ﬁbers restrictedthe size of the process zone ( h).
The process zone mechanism often results in a rising R curve, as Figure 6.29 illustrates. The
material resistance increases with crack growth, as the width of the processes zone grows. Even-tually, h and 
GR reach steady-state values.
Figure 6.30 illustrates the crack bridging mechanism, where the propagating crack leaves ﬁbers
or second-phase particles intact. The unbroken ﬁbers or particles exert a traction force on the crackfaces, much like the Dugdale-Barenblatt strip-yield model [18, 19]. The ﬁbers eventually rupturewhen the stress reaches a critical value. According to Equation (3.42) and Equation (3.43), theFIGURE 6.29 The process-zone toughening mechanism usually results in a rising R curve.

critical energy release rate for crack propagation is given by
(6.22)
The sections that follow outline several speciﬁc toughening mechanisms in modern ceramics.
6.2.1 M ICROCRACK  TOUGHENING
Although the formation of cracks in a material is generally considered deleterious, microcracking
can sometimes lead to improved toughness. Consider a material sample of volume V that forms N
microcracks when subject to a particular stress. If these cracks are penny shaped with an averageradius a, the total work required to form these microcracks is equal to the surface energy times the
total area created:
(6.23)
The formation of microcracks releases the strain energy from the sample, which results in anincrease in compliance. If this change in compliance is gradual, as existing microcracks grow andnew cracks form, a nonlinear stress-strain curve results. The change in strain-energy density dueto the microcrack formation is given by
(6.24)
where  is the microcrack density. For a macroscopic crack that produces a process zone ofmicrocracks, the increment of toughening due to microcrack formation can be inferred by insertingEquation (6.24) into Equation (6.21).
A major problem with the above scenario is that stable  microcrack growth does not usually
occur in a brittle solid. Preexisting ﬂaws in the material remain stationary until they satisfy theGrifﬁth criterion, at which time they become unstable. Stable crack advance normally requireseither a rising R curve, where the fracture work w
f (Figure 2.6) increases with crack extension, or
physical barriers in the material that inhibit crack growth. Stable microcracking occurs in concretebecause aggregates act as crack arresters (see Section 6.3).
Certain multiphase ceramics have the potential for microcrack toughening. Figure 6.31 sche-
matically illustrates this toughening mechanism [40]. Second-phase particles often are subject toresidual stress due to thermal expansion mismatch or transformation. If the residual stress in theparticle is tensile and the local stress in the matrix is compressive,
8 the particle cracks. If the signs
on the stresses are reversed, the matrix material cracks at the interface. In both cases there is a residualopening of the microcracks, which leads to an increase in volume in the sample. Figure 6.31 illustratesthe stress-strain response of such a material. The material begins to crack at a critical stress 
σc,
and the stress-strain curve becomes nonlinear, due to a combination of compliance increase anddilatational strain. If the material is unloaded prior to total failure, the relative contributions ofdilatational effects (residual microcrack opening) and modulus effects (due to the release of strainenergy) are readily apparent.
A number of multiphase ceramic materials exhibit trends in toughness with particle size and
temperature that are consistent with the microcracking mechanism, but this phenomenon has beendirectly observed only in aluminum oxide toughened with monoclinic zirconium dioxide [41].

286 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
This mechanism is relatively ineffective, as Table 6.1 indicates. Moreover, the degree of micro-
crack toughening is temperature dependent. Thermal mismatch and the resulting residual stresses
tend to be lower at elevated temperatures, which implies less dilatational strain. Also, lower residualstresses may not prevent the microcracks from becoming unstable and propagating through theparticle–matrix interface.
6.2.2 T RANSFORMATION  TOUGHENING
Some ceramic materials experience a stress-induced martensitic transformation that results in sheardeformation and a volume change (i.e., a dilatational strain). Ceramics that contain second-phaseparticles that transform often have improved toughness. Zirconium dioxide (ZrO
2) is the most
widely studied material that exhibits a stress-induced martensitic transformation [42].
Figure 6.32 illustrates the typical stress-strain behavior for a martensitic transformation [42].
At a critical stress, the material transforms, resulting in both dilatational and shear strains. Figure 6.33(a)shows a crack-tip process zone, where second-phase particles have transformed.
The toughening mechanism for such a material can be explained in terms of the work argument:
energy dissipation in the process zone results in higher toughness. An alternative explanation isthat of crack-tip shielding , where the transformation lowers the local crack driving force [42].
Figure 6.33(b) shows the stress distribution ahead of the crack with a transformed process zone.FIGURE 6.31 The microcrack toughening mechanism. The formation of microcracks in or near second-phase
particles results in release of strain energy (modulus work) and residual microcrack opening (dilatational
work). Taken from Evans, A.G., “The New High Toughness Ceramics.” ASTM STP 1020, American Societyfor Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA, 1989, pp. 267–291.

Fracture Mechanisms in Nonmetals 287
Outside of this zone, the stress ﬁeld is deﬁned by the global stress intensity, but the stress ﬁeld in
the process zone is lower, due to dilatational effects. The crack-tip work and shielding explanationsare consistent with one another; more work is required for crack extension when the local stressesare reduced. Crack-tip shielding due to the martensitic transformation is analogous to the stressredistribution that accompanies plastic zone formation in metals (Chapter 2).
The transformation stress and the dilatational strain are temperature dependent. These quantities
inﬂuence the size of the process zone h, and the strain-energy density within this zone. Consequently,
the effectiveness of the transformation-toughening mechanism also depends on temperature. BelowM
s, the martensite start temperature, the transformation occurs spontaneously, and the transforma-
tion stress is essentially zero. Thermally transformed martensite does not cause crack-tip shielding,however [42]. Above M
s, the transformation stress increases with temperature. When this stress
becomes sufﬁciently large, the transformation-toughening mechanism is no longer effective.
6.2.3 D UCTILE  PHASE TOUGHENING
Ceramics alloyed with ductile particles exhibit both bridging and process-zone toughening, asFigure 6.34 illustrates. Plastic deformation of the particles in the process zone contributes toughness,as does the ductile rupture of the particles that intersect the crack plane. Figure 6.35 is an SEMfractograph of bridging zones in Al
2O3 reinforced with aluminum [40]. Residual stresses in the
particles can also add to the material’s toughness. The magnitude of the bridging and process-zonetoughening depends on the volume fraction and ﬂow properties of the particles. The process-zonetoughening also depends on the particle size, with small particles giving the highest toughness [40].FIGURE 6.33 The martensitic toughening mechanism. Transformation of particles near the crack-tip results
in a nonlinear process-zone and crack-tip shielding.

1656_C006.fm  Page 287  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:50 PM
288 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
This toughening mechanism is temperature dependent, since the ﬂow properties of the metal
particles vary with temperature. Ductile phase ceramics are obviously inappropriate for applications
above the melting temperature of the metal particles.
6.2.4 F IBER AND WHISKER  TOUGHENING
One of the most interesting features of ceramic composites is that the combination of a brittleceramic matrix with brittle ceramic ﬁbers or whiskers can result in a material with relatively hightoughness (Table 6.1). The secret to the high toughness of ceramic composites lies in the bondbetween the matrix and the ﬁbers or whiskers. Having a brittle  interface leads to higher toughness
than a strong interface. Thus ceramic composites defy intuition: a brittle matrix bonded to a brittleﬁber by a brittle interface results in a tough material.
A weak interface between the matrix and the reinforcing material aids the bridging mechanism.
When a matrix crack encounters a ﬁber/matrix interface, this interface experiences Mode II loading;debonding occurs if the fracture energy of the interface is low (Figure 6.36(a)). If the extent ofdebonding is sufﬁcient, the matrix crack bypasses the ﬁber, leaving it intact. Mathematical models[43] of ﬁber/matrix debonding predict crack bridging when the interfacial fracture energy is anFIGURE 6.35 Ductile-phase bridging in Al2O3/Al. Photograph provided by A.G. Evans.

order of magnitude smaller than the matrix toughness. If the interfacial bond is strong, matrix
cracks propagate through the ﬁber, and the composite toughness obeys a rule of mixtures; butbridging increases the composite toughness (Figure 6.36(c)).
An alternate model [43–45] for bridging in ﬁber-reinforced ceramics assumes that the ﬁbers
are not bonded, but that friction between the ﬁbers and the matrix restricts the crack opening (Figure 6.36(b)).The model that considers Mode II debonding [43] neglects friction effects, and predicts that thelength of the debond controls the crack opening.
Both models predict steady-state cracking, where the matrix cracks at a constant stress that
does not depend on the initial ﬂaw distribution in the matrix. Experimental data support thesteady-state cracking theory. Because the cracking stress is independent of ﬂaw size, fracturetoughness measurements (e.g., K
Ic and Gc) have little or no meaning.
Figure 6.37 illustrates the stress-strain behavior of a ﬁber-reinforced ceramic. The behavior is
linear elastic up to σc, the steady-state cracking stress in the matrix. Once the matrix has cracked,FIGURE 6.36 Fiber bridging in ceramic composites. Mathematical models treat bridging either in terms of
ﬁber/matrix debonding or frictional sliding. This mechanism provides composite toughness well in excess of
that predicted by the rule of mixtures. (a) Fiber/matrix debonding, (b) frictional sliding along interfaces, and(c) effect of bridging on toughness.

the load is carried by the ﬁbers. The ﬁbers do not fail simultaneously, because the ﬁber strength
is subject to statistical variability [46]. Consequently, the material exhibits quasi ductility, wheredamage accumulates gradually until ﬁnal failure.
Not only is ﬁber bridging the most effective toughening mechanism for ceramics (Table 6.1),
it is also effective at high temperatures [47, 48]. Consequently applications that require load-bearingcapability at temperatures above 1000 °C will undoubtedly utilize ﬁber-reinforced ceramics.
Whisker-reinforced ceramics possess reasonably high toughness, although whisker reinforcement
is not as effective as continuous ﬁbers. The primary failure mechanism in whisker composites appearsto be bridging [49]; crack deﬂection also adds an increment of toughness. Figure 6.38 is a micrographthat illustrates crack bridging in an Al
2O3 ceramic reinforced by SiC whiskers.FIGURE 6.37 Stress-strain behavior of ﬁber-reinforced ceramic composites.

6.3 CONCRETE AND ROCK
Although concrete and rock are often considered brittle, they are actually quasi-brittle  materials
that are tougher than most of the so-called advanced ceramics. In fact, much of the research on
toughening mechanisms in ceramics is aimed at trying to make ceramic composites behave morelike concrete.
Concrete and rock derive their toughness from subcritical cracking that precedes ultimate
failure. This subcritical damage results in a nonlinear stress-strain response and R-curve behavior.
A traditional strength-of-materials approach to designing with concrete has proved inadequate
because the fracture strength is often size dependent [50]. This size dependence is due to the factthat nonlinear deformation in these materials is caused by subcritical cracking rather than plasticity.Initial attempts to apply fracture mechanics to concrete were unsuccessful because these earlyapproaches were based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and failed to take account ofthe process zones that form in front of macroscopic cracks.
This section gives a brief overview of the mechanisms and models of fracture in concrete and
rock. Although most of the experimental and analytical work has been directed at concrete asopposed to rock, due to the obvious technological importance of the former, rock and concretebehave in a similar manner. The remainder of this section will refer primarily to concrete, with theimplicit understanding that most observations and models also apply to geologic materials.
Figure 6.39 schematically illustrates the formation of a fracture process zone in concrete,
together with two idealizations of the process zone. Microcracks form ahead of a macroscopiccrack, which consists of a bridged zone directly behind the tip and a traction-free zone furtherbehind the tip. The bridging is a result of the weak interface between the aggregates and the matrix.Recall Section 6.2.4, where it was stated that ﬁber bridging, which occurs when the ﬁber-matrixbonds are weak, is the most effective toughening mechanism in ceramic composites. The processzone can be modeled as a region of strain softening (Figure 6.40(b)) or as a longer crack that issubject to closure tractions (Figure 6.40(c)). The latter is a slight modiﬁcation to the Dugdale-Barenblatt strip-yield model.
Figure 6.40 illustrates the typical tensile response of concrete. After a small degree of nonlin-
earity caused by microcracking, the material reaches its tensile strength 
σt and then strain softens.
Once σt is reached, the subsequent damage is concentrated in a local fracture zone. Virtually all
of the displacement following the maximum stress is due to the damage zone. Note that Figure 6.40shows a schematic stress- displacement  curve rather than a stress-strain curve. The latter is inap-
propriate because nominal strain measured over the entire specimen is a function of gage length.
There are a number of models for fracture in concrete, but the one that is most widely referenced
is the so-called ﬁctitious crack model  of Hillerborg [51, 52]. This model, which has also been called
a cohesive zone model , is merely an application of the Dugdale-Barenblatt approach. The Hillerborg
model assumes that the stress displacement behavior (
σ-δ) observed in the damage zone of a tensile
specimen is a material property. Figure 6.41(a) shows a schematic stress-displacement curve, and6.41(b) illustrates the idealization of the damage zone ahead of a growing crack.
At the tip of the traction-free crack, the damage zone reaches a critical displacement 
δc. The
tractions are zero at this point, but are equal to the tensile strength σt, at the tip of the damage zone
(Figure 6.39(c)). Assuming that the closure stress σ and opening displacement δ are uniquely
related, the critical energy release rate for crack growth is given by
(6.25)
which is virtually identical to Equation (3.43) and Equation (6.22).
The key assumption of the Hillerborg model that the σ-δ relationship is a unique material
property is not strictly correct in most cases because process zones produced during the fractureGcdc

of concrete are often quite large, and the interaction between the process zone and free boundaries
can inﬂuence the behavior. Consequently, Gc is not a material property in general, but can depend
on specimen size. Fracture toughness results from small-scale tests tend to be lower than valuesobtained from larger samples.
The phenomena of size effects in concrete fracture has been the subject of considerable study
[50, 53–56]. Some of the apparent size effects can be attributed to inappropriate data reductionmethods. For example, if fracture toughness is computed by substituting the load at fracture intoa linear elastic K or 
G relationship, the resulting value will be size dependent, because the nonlin-
earity due to the process zone has been neglected. Such an approach is analogous to applying linearelastic K equations to metal specimens that exhibit signiﬁcant plasticity prior to failure. Even
approaches that account for the process zone exhibit size dependence, however [54]. A fractureparameter that uniquely characterizes these materials would be of great beneﬁt.

Fracture Toughness 
Testing of Metals 
A fracture toughness test measures the resistance of a material to crack extension. Such a test may
yield either a single value of fracture toughness or a resistance curve, where a toughness parametersuch as  
K 
,  
J 
, or 
  
CTOD 
  
is plotted against the crack extension. A single toughness value is usually
sufﬁcient to describe a test that fails by cleavage, because this fracture mechanism is typicallyunstable. The situation is similar to the schematic in Figure 2.10(a), which illustrates a materialwith a ﬂat 
 R  
curve. Cleavage fracture actually has a falling resistance curve, as Figure 4.8 illustrates.
Crack growth by microvoid coalescence, however, usually yields a rising 
 R  
curve, such as that
shown in Figure 2.10(b); ductile crack growth can be stable, at least initially. When ductile crackgrowth initiates in a test specimen, that specimen seldom fails immediately. Therefore, one canquantify ductile fracture resistance either by the initiation value or by the entire 
 R  
curve.
A variety of organizations throughout the world publish standardized procedures for fracture
toughness measurements, including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), theBritish Standards Institution (BSI), the International Institute of Standards (ISO), and the JapanSociety of Mechanical Engineers (JSME). The ﬁrst standards for 
 K  
and 
 J  
testing were developed
by ASTM in 1970 and 1981, respectively, while BSI published the ﬁrst 
  
CTOD 
  
test method in 1979.
Existing fracture toughness standards include procedures for  
K 
Ic 
,  
K-R 
 curve,  
J 
Ic 
, 
 J-R  
curve,
CTOD, and  
K

 testing. This chapter focuses primarily on ASTM standards, since they are the most
widely used throughout the world. Standards produced by other organizations, however, are broadlyconsistent with the ASTM procedures, and usually differ only in minute details. The existingstandards are continually evolving, as the technology improves and more experience is gained.
The reader should not rely on this chapter alone for guidance on conducting fracture toughness
tests, but should consult the relevant standards. Also, the reader is strongly encouraged to reviewChapter 2 and Chapter 3 in order to gain an understanding of the fundamental basis of  
K 
,  
J 
, and
CTOD, as well as the limitations of these parameters. 
7.1GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Virtually all fracture toughness tests have several common features. The design of test specimens issimilar in each of the standards, and the orientation of the specimen relative to symmetry directionsin the material is always an important consideration. The cracks in test specimens are introduced byfatigue in each case, although the requirements for fatigue loads varies from one standard to the next.The basic instrumentation required to measure load and displacement is common to virtually allfracture mechanics tests, but some tests require additional instrumentation to monitor crack growth.

ONFIGURATIONS 
There are ﬁve types of specimens that are permitted in ASTM standards that characterize fractureinitiation and crack growth, although no single standard allows all ﬁve conﬁgurations, and thedesign of a particular specimen type may vary between standards. The conﬁgurations that arecurrently standardized include the compact specimen, the single-edge-notched bend (SE(B)) geom-etry, the arc-shaped specimen, the disk specimen, and the middle tension (MT) panel. Figure 7.1shows a drawing of each specimen type.7

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals

An additional conﬁguration, the compact crack-arrest specimen, is used for  
K 
Ia 
 measurements
and is described in Section 7.6. Specimens for qualitative toughness measurements, such as Charpy
and drop-weight tests, are discussed in Section 7.9. Chevron-notched specimens, which are appliedto brittle materials, are discussed in Chapter 8.
Each specimen conﬁguration has three important characteristic dimensions:  the crack length
( 
a 
), the thickness ( 
B 
) and the width ( 
W 
). In most cases,  
W 
= 
2B 
 and  
a 
/ 
W 
 ≈  
0.5, but there are
exceptions, which are discussed later in this chapter.
There are a number of specimen conﬁgurations that are used in research, but have yet to be
standardized. Some of the more common nonstandard conﬁgurations include the single-edge-notched tensile panel, the double-edge-notched tensile panel, the axisymmetric-notched bar, andthe double cantilever beam specimen.
The vast majority of fracture toughness tests are performed on either compact or SE(B) specimens.
Figure 7.2 illustrates the proﬁles of these two specimen types, assuming the same characteristicdimensions ( 
B 
,  
W 
,  
a 
). The compact geometry obviously consumes less material, but this specimen
requires extra material in the width direction, due to the holes. If one is testing a plate material or aforging, the compact specimen is more economical, but the SE(B) conﬁguration may be preferablefor weldment testing, because less weld metal is consumed in some orientations (Section 7.7).
The compact specimen is pin-loaded by special clevises, as illustrated in Figure 7.3. Compact
specimens are usually machined in a limited number of sizes because a separate test ﬁxture mustbe fabricated for each specimen size. Specimen size is usually scaled geometrically; standard sizesinclude T, 1T, 2T, and 4T, where the nomenclature refers to the thickness in inches. 
1 
 For example,
a standard 1T compact specimen has the dimensions  
B 
 = 1 in. (25.4 mm) and  
W 
 = 2 in. (50.8 mm).
Although ASTM has adopted SI units as their standard, the above nomenclature for compactspecimen sizes persists.
The SE(B) specimen is more ﬂexible with respect to size. The standard loading span for SE(B)
specimens is 4 
W 
. If the ﬁxture is designed properly, the span can be adjusted continuously to any
value that is within its capacity. Thus, SE(B) specimens with a wide range of dimensions can betested with a single ﬁxture. An apparatus for three-point bend testing is shown in Figure 7.4.

RIENTATION 
Engineering materials are seldom homogeneous and isotropic. Microstructure, and thus, mechanicalproperties, are often sensitive to direction. The sensitivity to orientation is particularly pronouncedin fracture toughness measurements, because a microstructure with a preferred orientation maycontain planes of weakness, where crack propagation is relatively easy. Since specimen orientation

teristic dimensions (

An exception to this interpretation of the nomenclature occurs in thin sheet specimens, as discussed in Section 7.3.

is such an important variable in fracture toughness measurements, all ASTM fracture testing
standards require that the orientation be reported along with the measured toughness; ASTM hasadopted a notation for this purpose [1].
Figure 7.5 illustrates the ASTM notation for fracture specimens extracted from a rolled plate
or forging. When the specimen is aligned with the axes of symmetry in the plate, there are sixpossible orientations. The letters  
L 
,  
T 
, and  
S 
 denote the longitudinal, transverse, and short
transverse directions, respectively, relative to the rolling direction or forging axis. Note that twoletters are required to identify the orientation of a fracture mechanics specimen; the ﬁrst letterindicates the direction of the principal tensile stress, which is always perpendicular to the crackplane in Mode I tests, and the second letter denotes the direction of crack propagation. For example,the  
L-T 
 orientation corresponds to loading in the longitudinal direction and crack propagation in
the transverse direction.
A similar notation applies to round bars and hollow cylinders, as Figure 7.6 illustrates. The
symmetry directions in this case are circumferential, radial, and longitudinal ( 
C 
,  
R 
, and  
L 
, respectively).
Ideally, one should measure the toughness of a material in several orientations, but this is often
not practical. When choosing an appropriate specimen orientation, one should bear in mind thepurpose of the test, as well as the geometrical constraints imposed by the material. A low toughnessorientation, where the crack propagates in the rolling direction ( 
T-L 
 or  
S-L 
), should be adopted for
general material characterization or screening. When the purpose of the test is to simulate conditionsin a ﬂawed structure, however, the crack orientation should match that of the structural ﬂaw.Geometrical constraints may preclude testing some conﬁgurations; the  
S-L 
 and  
S-T 
 orientations,
for example, are practical only in thick sections. The  
T-S 
 and  
L-S 
 orientations may limit the size
of the compact specimen that can be extracted from a rolled plate.

RECRACKING 
Fracture mechanics theory applies to cracks that are inﬁnitely sharp prior to loading. Whilelaboratory specimens invariably fall short of this ideal, it is possible to introduce cracks that aresufﬁciently sharp for practical purposes. The most efﬁcient way to produce such a crack is throughcyclic loading.

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Figure 7.7 illustrates the precracking procedure in a typical specimen, where a fatigue crack
initiates at the tip of a machined notch and grows to the desired size through careful control of the
cyclic loads. Modern servo-hydraulic test machines can be programmed to produce sinusoidalloading, as well as a variety of other wave forms. Dedicated fatigue precracking machines thatcycle at a high frequency are also available.
The fatigue crack must be introduced in such a way as not to adversely inﬂuence the toughness
value that is to be measured. Cyclic loading produces a crack of ﬁnite radius with a small plasticzone at the tip, which contains strain-hardened material and a complicated residual stress distribution(see Chapter 10). In order for a fracture toughness measurement to reﬂect the true materialproperties, the fatigue crack must satisfy the following conditions:
• The crack-tip radius at failure must be much larger than the initial radius of the fatigue
crack.
• The plastic zone produced during fatigue cracking must be small compared to the plastic
zone at fracture.

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 
305 
Each of the various fracture testing standards contains restrictions on fatigue loads, which are
designed to satisfy the above requirements. The precise guidelines depend on the nature of the test.In  
K 
Ic 
 tests, for example, the maximum 
 K  
during fatigue loading must be no greater than a particular
fraction of  
K 
Ic 
. In 
 J  
and CTOD 
  
tests, where the test specimen is typically fully plastic at failure,
the maximum fatigue load is deﬁned as a fraction of the load at ligament yielding. Of course onecan always perform fatigue precracking well below the allowable loads in order to gain additionalassurance of the validity of the results, but the time required to produce the crack (i.e., the numberof cycles) increases rapidly with decreasing fatigue loads. 
7.1.4 I 
NSTRUMENTATION 
At a minimum, the applied load and a characteristic displacement on the specimen must be measuredduring a fracture toughness test. Additional instrumentation is applied to some specimens in orderto monitor the crack growth or to measure more than one displacement.
Measuring load during a conventional fracture toughness test is relatively straightforward, since
nearly all test machines are equipped with load cells. The most common displacement transducerin fracture mechanics tests is the clip gage, which is illustrated in Figure 7.8. The clip gage, whichattaches to the mouth of the crack, consists of four resistance-strain gages bonded to a pair ofcantilever beams. Deﬂection of the beams results in a change in voltage across the strain gages,which varies linearly with displacement. A clip gage must be attached to sharp knife edges in orderto ensure that the ends of each beam are free to rotate. The knife edges can either be machinedinto the specimen or attached to the specimen at the crack mouth.
A  
linear variable differential transformer 
 (LVDT) provides an alternative means for inferring
displacements in fracture toughness tests. Figure 7.9 schematically illustrates the underlying prin-ciple of an LVDT. A steel rod is placed inside a hollow cylinder that contains a pair of tightlywound coils of wire. When a current passes through the ﬁrst coil, the core becomes magnetizedand induces a voltage in the second core. When the rod moves, the voltage drop in the second coilchanges; the change in voltage varies linearly with displacement of the rod. The LVDT is usefulfor measuring displacements on a test specimen at locations other than the crack mouth.
The  
potential drop 
 technique utilizes a voltage change to infer the crack growth, as illustrated
in Figure 7.10. If a constant current passes through the uncracked ligament of a test specimen, thevoltage must increase as the crack grows because the electrical resistance increases and the net

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
cross-sectional area decreases. The potential drop method can use either DC or AC current. See
Refs. [2] and [3] for examples of this technique.
The disadvantage of the potential drop technique is that it requires additional instrumentation.
The  
unloading compliance 
 technique [4], however, allows the crack growth to be inferred from the
load and displacement transducers that are part of any standard fracture mechanics test. A specimencan be partially unloaded at various points during the test in order to measure the elastic compliance,which can be related to the crack length. Section 7.4 describes the unloading compliance techniquein more detail.
In some cases it is necessary to measure more than one displacement on a test specimen. For
example, one may want to measure both the crack-mouth-opening displacement (CMOD) and thedisplacement along the loading axis. A compact specimen can be designed such that the load linedisplacement and the CMOD are identical, but these two displacements do not coincide in an SE(B)specimen. Figure 7.11 illustrates simultaneous CMOD and load line displacement measurement inan SE(B) specimen. The CMOD is inferred from a clip gage attached to knife edges; the knifeedge height must be taken into account when computing the relevant toughness parameter (seeSection 7.5). The load-line displacement can be inferred by a number of methods, including thecomparison bar technique [5, 6] that is illustrated in Figure 7.11. A bar is attached to the specimenat two points that are aligned with the outer loading points. The outer coil of an LVDT is attachedto the comparison bar, which remains ﬁxed during deformation, while the central rod is free tomove as the specimen deﬂects.

ROOVING 
In certain cases, grooves are machined into the sides of a fracture toughness specimens [7], as
Figure 7.12 illustrates. The primary purpose of side grooving is to maintain a straight crack frontduring an  
R 
-curve test. A specimen without side grooves is subject to crack tunneling and shear lip
formation (Figure 5.15) because the material near the outer surfaces is in a state of low-stress triaxiality.Side grooves remove the low triaxiality zone and, if done properly, lead to relatively straight crack fronts.

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Typical side-grooved fracture toughness specimens have a net thickness that is approximately 80%
of the gross thickness. If the side grooves are too deep, they produce lateral singularities, which causethe crack to grow more rapidly at the outer edges.

ASTM E 399 [8], was originally published in 1970. This standard has undergone a number ofrevisions over the years, but the key provisions have remained largely unchanged. Other  
K 
Ic 
 testing
standards have been published throughout the world, including the British Standard 5447 [9], butare generally based on ASTM E 399.
In ASTM E 399 and similar test methods,  
K 
Ic 
 is referred to as ‘‘plane strain fracture toughness.’’
This phrase actually appears in the title of ASTM E 399. In the 1960s, it was postulated that smallspecimens or thin sections fail under plane stress conditions, and that ‘‘plane strain fracture’’ occursin thick sections. The ASTM E 399 test method reﬂects this viewpoint. Over the years, it has beentaken as an indisputable fact that toughness decreases with increasing specimen size until a plateauis reached. Specimen size requirements in ASTM E 399 are intended to ensure that  
K 
Ic 
 measurements
correspond to the supposed plane strain plateau.
There are a number of serious problems with ASTM E 399 and its underlying assumptions.
Section 2.10 in Chapter 2 reexamines the conventional wisdom with respect to so-called ‘‘planestress fracture’’ and ‘‘plane strain fracture.’’ Three-dimensional ﬁnite element analysis of the stressstate at the tip of a crack has revealed that the traditional view of the effect of specimen size onfracture toughness is simplistic and misleading. In addition, it can be shown that the E 399 testmethod results in a size dependence in the apparent  
K 
Ic 
 that is the opposite of what conventional
wisdom suggests.

The existing

 test procedure is outlined below. This is followed by a discussion of the
limitations and pitfalls of the current approach. 
7.2.1ASTM E 399 
The title of ASTM E 399, ‘‘ 
Standard Test Method for Plane Strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic
Materials, ’ 
’ is somewhat misleading. As discussed in Section 2.10, the specimen size requirements
in this standard are far more stringent than they need to be to ensure predominately plane strain
conditions at the crack tip. The real key to a  
K 
-based test method is ensuring that the specimen
fractures under nominally linear elastic conditions. That is, the plastic zone must be small comparedto the specimen cross section. Consequently, the important specimen dimensions to ensure a valid 
K test are the crack length a and the ligament length W – a, not the thickness B. Keeping these
issues in mind, let us explore the current E 399 test method.
Four specimen conﬁgurations are permitted by the current version of E 399: the compact,
SE(B), arc-shaped, and disk-shaped specimens. Specimens for K
Ic tests are usually fabricated with
the width W equal to twice the thickness B. They are fatigue precracked so that the crack
length/width ratio ( a/W) lies between 0.45 and 0.55. Thus, the specimen design is such that all of
the key dimensions, a, B, and W−a, are approximately equal. This design results in the efﬁcient
use of material, since the standard requires that each of these dimensions must be large comparedto the plastic zone.
Most standardized mechanical tests (fracture toughness and otherwise) lead to valid results as
long as the technician follows all of the procedures outlined in the standard. The K
Ic test, however,
often produces invalid results through no fault of the technician. If the plastic zone at fracture istoo large, it is not possible to obtain a valid K
Ic, regardless of how skilled the technician is.
Because of the strict size requirements, ASTM E 399 recommends that the user perform a
preliminary validity check to determine the appropriate specimen dimensions. The size requirementsfor a valid K
Ic are as follows:
In order to determine the required specimen dimensions, the user must make a rough estimate ofthe anticipated K
Ic for the material. Such an estimate can come from data for similar materials. If
such data are not available, the ASTM standard provides a table of recommended thicknesses forvarious strength levels. Although there is a tendency for toughness to decrease with increasingstrength, there is not a unique relationship between K
Ic and sYS in metals. Thus, the strength-
thickness table in E 399 should be used only when better data are not available.
During the initial stages of fatigue precracking, the peak value of stress intensity in a single
cycle Kmax should be no larger than 0.8 KIc, according to ASTM E 399. As the crack approaches its
ﬁnal size, Kmax should be less than 0.6 KIc. If the specimen is fatigued at one temperature ( T1) and
tested at a different temperature ( T2), the ﬁnal Kmax must be . The fatigue load
requirements are less stringent at initiation because the ﬁnal crack tip is remote from any damagedmaterial that is produced in the early part of precracking. The maximum stress intensity duringfatigue must always be less than K
Ic, however, in order to avoid the premature failure of the
specimen.
Of course, one must know KIc to determine the maximum allowable fatigue loads. The user
must specify fatigue loads based on the anticipated toughness of the material. If he or she isconservative and selects low loads, precracking could take a very long time. On the other hand, ifprecracking is conducted at high loads, the user risks an invalid result, in which case the specimenand the technician’s time are wasted.BaKIC

310 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
When a precracked test specimen is loaded to failure, load and displacement are monitored.
Three types of load-displacement curves are shown in Figure 7.13. The critical load PQ is deﬁned
in one of several ways, depending on the type of curve. One must construct a 5% secant line (i.e.,
a line from the origin with a slope equal to 95% of the initial elastic loading slope) to determineP
5. In the case of Type I behavior, the load-displacement curve is smooth and it deviates slightly
from linearity before reaching a maximum load Pmax. This nonlinearity can be caused by plasticity,
subcritical crack growth, or both. For a Type I curve, PQ = P5. With a Type II curve, a small amount
of unstable crack growth (i.e., a pop-in) occurs before the curve deviates from linearity by 5%. Inthis case P
Q is deﬁned at the pop-in. A specimen that exhibits Type III behavior fails completely
before achieving 5% nonlinearity. In such cases, PQ = Pmax.
The crack length must be measured from the fracture surface. Since there is a tendency for the
crack depth to vary through the thickness, the crack length is deﬁned as the average of three evenlyspaced measurements. Once P
Q and the crack length are determined, a provisional fracture tough-
ness KQ is computed from the following relationship:
(7.1)
where f(a/W) is a dimensionless function of a/W. This function is given in polynomial form in the
E 399 standard for the four specimen types. Individual values of f(a/W) are also tabulated in ASTM
E 399. See Table 2.4 and Appendix 7 for  K solutions for a variety of conﬁgurations.
The KQ value computed from Equation (7.1) is a valid KIc result only if all validity requirements
in the standard are met, including

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 311
Additional validity requirements include the restrictions on the fatigue load mentioned earlier, as
well as limits on the fatigue crack curvature. If the test meets all of the requirements of ASTM E399, then K
Q = KIc.
Because the size requirements of ASTM E 399 are very stringent, it is very difﬁcult and
sometimes impossible to measure a valid KIc in most structural materials, as Example 7.1 and
Example 7.2 illustrate. A material must either be relatively brittle or the test specimen must bevery large for linear elastic fracture mechanics to be valid. In low- and medium-strength structuralsteels, valid K
Ic tests are normally possible only on the lower shelf of toughness; in the ductile-
brittle transition and the upper shelf, elastic-plastic parameters such as the  J integral and  CTOD
are required to characterize fracture. 
Because of the strict validity requirements, the KIc test is of limited value to structural metals.
The toughness and thickness of most materials precludes a valid KIc result. If, however, a valid
KIc test can be measured on a given material, it is probably too brittle for most structural
applications.
When attempting to measure fracture toughness using ASTM E 399, one runs the risk of invalid
results due to the stringent size requirements. Once a result is declared invalid, E 399 offers norecourse for deriving useful information from the test. A more recent ASTM standard, E 1820 [4],provides an alterative test methodology that permits valid fracture toughness estimates from sup-posedly invalid K tests. ASTM E 1820 is a generalized test method for fracture toughness mea-
surement that combines K, J, and CTOD parameters in a single standard. This standard provides
a single test method for all three parameters and then offers a choice of post-test analysis proceduresthat pertain to a range of material behavior. If a test specimen exhibits too much plasticity tocompute a valid K
Ic, the fracture toughness of the material can be characterized by J or CTOD.
The calculation procedure and size requirements for KIc are essentially the same in E 399 and E
1820, but the latter relaxes specimen geometry requirements somewhat. For example, E 1820permits side-grooved specimens in K
Ic tests. The standard BS 7448: Part 1 [10] is the British
equivalent of ASTM E 1820.
EXAMPLE 7.1
Consider a structural steel with σYS = 350 MPa (51 ksi). Estimate the specimen dimensions required
for a valid KIc test. Assume that this material is on the upper shelf of toughness, where typical KIc values
for the initiation of microvoid coalescence in these materials are around 200 MPa .
Solution : Inserting the yield strength and estimated toughness into Equation (7.2a) gives
Since a/W ≈ 0.5, W = 1.63 m (64.2 in.)! Thus a very large specimen would be required for a valid
KIc test. Materials are seldom available in such thicknesses. Even if a sufﬁciently large section
thickness were fabricated, testing such a large specimen would not be practical; machining would
be prohibitively expensive, and a special testing machine with a high load capacity would beneeded.

B = a = 25 mm and W = 50 mm. Inserting these dimensions and the yield strength into Equation (7.2a)
and solving for KIc gives
Figure 4.5 shows fracture toughness data for A 572 Grade 50 steel. Note that the toughness level computed
above corresponds to the lower shelf in this material. Thus, valid KIc tests on this material would be
possible only at low temperatures, where the material is too brittle for most structural applications.
7.2.2 S HORTCOMINGS  OF E 399 AND SIMILAR  STANDARDS
Section 2.10 in Chapter 2 reexamines the conventional wisdom regarding the effect of plate thickness
on apparent fracture toughness. The 1960s-vintage data that led to the hypothesis of a transition from‘‘plane stress fracture’’ to ‘‘plane strain fracture’’ consisted almost entirely of materials that fail bymicrovoid coalescence (see Chapter 5). As Figure 2.45 illustrates, the observed thickness effect onfracture toughness is due to a competition between two fracture morphologies: slant fracture, whichoccurs on a 45 ° plane, and ﬂat fracture, where the fracture plane is normal to the applied stress.

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 313
In thinner specimens, the apparent fracture toughness is higher because slant fracture dominates.
Figure 7.14 shows the effect of specimen thickness on KQ in a titanium alloy [11]. In this case, the
ligament length was ﬁxed while thickness was varied. The measured toughness reaches a plateauvalue in this material when .
When crack extension occurs by ductile tearing (microvoid coalescence), the fracture toughness
is characterized by a rising R curve. As Figure 7.15 illustrates, the R curve for slant fracture is
signiﬁcantly steeper than for ﬂat fracture. The effective R curve for a specimen that experiences bothmorphologies will fall somewhere between these extremes. The relative amount of slant vs. ﬂat fractureaffects the K
Q value, as measured in accordance with the E 399 procedure. A side-grooved specimen
(Figure 7.12) eliminates the shear lips and enables the R curve for ﬂat fracture to be determined.
ASTM E 399 does not permit side-grooved specimens, but E 1820 does allow side grooves in KIc tests.
Although shear lips can be eliminated by the proper use of side grooves, there is another serious
problem with the E 399 test procedure when it is applied to a material that exhibits a rising R
curve. Figure 7.16 is a plot of KQ vs. ligament length for a high-strength aluminum alloy [12, 13].
Note that the measured toughness actually increases  with specimen size, which runs counter to the
conventional wisdom. This size effect on apparent toughness can be understood by examining howK
Q is measured. In a Type I load-displacement curve (Figure 7.13), which is typical of crack growth
by ductile tearing, PQ is deﬁned as the point where the curve deviates from linearity by 5%. If the
nonlinearity is due predominately to the crack growth, a 5% deviation from linearity correspondsapproximately to the crack extension through 2% of the ligament. The specimen size effect inFigure 7.16 results from measuring K
Q at different amounts of absolute crack growth.
Figure 7.17 illustrates the inherent size effect in KQ when it is based on a 2% relative crack growth.
If the R curve is insensitive to the specimen size, specimens with larger ligaments will result in higher
KQ values because the measuring point is further up the R curve. The relative steepness of the R curve
governs the magnitude of the KQ size effect in materials that experience ductile crack extension. The
E 399 procedure will result in size-independent toughness values only if the R curve is ﬂat.
The original authors of E 399 were aware of the potential for size effects such as in Figure 7.16,
although they may not have fully understood the reasons for this behavior. In an effort to addressthis issue, they set a maximum of 1.10 on the P
max/PQ ratio (Equation (7.2c)). This additional
restriction has been somewhat effective in reducing the size effect because it excludes materialswith a steep R curve, as illustrated below.
Consider a material with an R curve that follows a power-law expression:

where A and m  are material constants. Using the above expression, and assuming that nonlinearity
in the load-displacement curve is due entirely to crack growth, it is possible to compute the Pmax/PQ
ratio for standard test specimens. Figure 7.18 shows the results of such an exercise for the compact
specimen [13]. The load ratio is a function of the exponent m, but is insensitive to a/W. Moreover,
this analysis predicts that the computed Pmax/PQ ratio is completely independent of the absoluteFIGURE 7.16 Effect of ligament length on apparent fracture toughness in an aluminum alloy. Taken from

specimen width W. The restriction of Equation (7.2c) is satisﬁed only for m < 0.10. Therefore, ASTM
E 399 is applicable only to materials with relatively ﬂat R curves, irrespective of specimen size.2
For materials that fail by cleavage fracture, the nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve is
due to plastic zone formation rather than stable crack growth. In such cases, the 5% secant method
is totally inappropriate for estimating the fracture toughness. Rather, the load at which unstablecrack extension occurs should be used to compute the toughness. If the nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve is small, the fracture load can be substituted into Equation (7.1) to computeK
Q. If there is a signiﬁcant nonlinearity due to plastic deformation, the toughness should be
characterized by J or CTOD. A key advantage to generalized test methods such as ASTM E 1820
and BS 7448 is that they allow for both linear elastic and elastic-plastic material behavior.
As of this writing, the ASTM Committee E08 on fatigue and fracture is considering a complete
overhaul of the E 399 standard to address the problems described earlier. Wallin [13] has outlineda proposed framework for an improved E 399 test method. He states that K
Q should be based on
a ﬁxed amount of absolute crack growth rather than 2% of the ligament. Given that such aFIGURE 7.18 Theoretical calculation of the Pmax/PQ ratio, assuming all nonlinearity is due to crack growth
and the R curve follows Equation (7.3). Taken from Wallin, K., ‘‘Critical Assessment of the Standard E 399.’’
ASTM STP 1461, American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, PA, 2004.
2 This analysis is based on the assumption of a power-law R curve.  Real materials do not exhibit an indeﬁnitely rising R
curve, however.  When ductile crack extension occurs in small-scale yielding, the material resistance eventually reaches a
steady state, as discussed in Section 3.5.2.  Therefore, it is theoretically possible to test a specimen of sufﬁcient size tomeet the E 399 requirements, even if the initial R curve slope is relatively steep.  However, since specimen size is limited
by practical considerations, the current version of E 399 is suitable only for materials with relatively ﬂat R curves.

modiﬁcation would eliminate the size effect illustrated in Figure 7.16 and Figure 7.17, Wallin
argues that the restriction on Pmax/PQ in Equation (7.2c) would no longer be necessary.
7.3K-R CURVE TESTING
As discussed in the previous section, materials that fail by microvoid coalescence usually exhibita rising R curve. The ASTM E 399 test method measures a single point on the R curve. This method
contains an inherent size dependence on apparent toughness because the point on the R curve at
which K
Q is deﬁned is a function of the ligament length, as Figure 7.17 illustrates.
An alternative to measuring a single toughness value is determining the entire R curve for
materials that exhibit ductile crack extension. The ASTM Standard E 561 [14] outlines a procedurefor determining  K vs. crack growth curves in such materials. Unlike ASTM E 399, the  K-R standard
does not contain a minimum thickness requirement, and thus can be applied to thin sheets. Thisstandard, however, is appropriate only when the plastic zone is small compared to the in-planedimensions of the test specimen. This test method is often applied to high-strength sheet materials.
As Figure 7.15 illustrates, thin sheets generally have a steeper R curve than thick sections
because the slant fracture morphology dominates in the former. There is a common misconceptionabout the effect of section thickness on the shape of the R curve. A number of published articles
and textbooks imply that thick sections, corresponding to so-called plane strain fracture, exhibit asingle value of fracture toughness ( K
Ic), while the same material in a thin section displays a rising
R curve. The latter is often mistakenly referred to as ‘‘plane stress fracture.’’ (Refer to Section 2.10
for a detailed discussion of the fallacies of the traditional ‘‘plane stress’’ and ‘‘plane strain’’descriptions of crack-tip conditions.) The section thickness has an effect on the crack-tip stressstate and the fracture morphology, which in turn affects the slope of the R curve (Figure 7.15).
However, a material that fails by microvoid coalescence usually has a rising R curve even for ﬂat
fracture under predominately plane strain conditions. The only instance where a thin section mightexhibit a rising R curve while a thick section of the same material has a ﬂat R curve (and a single-
valued toughness) is where the difference in crack-tip triaxiality causes a fracture mode changefrom ductile tearing to cleavage in thin and thick sections, respectively.
Figure 7.19 illustrates a typical  K-R curve in a predominantly linear elastic material. The  R
curve is initially very steep, as little or no crack growth occurs with increasing K
I. As the crack
begins to grow,  K increases with the crack growth until a steady state is reached, where the  R curve
becomes ﬂat (see Section 3.5 and Appendix 3.5). It is possible to deﬁne a critical stress intensityK
c where the driving force is tangent to the  R curve. This instability point is not a material property,
however, because the point of tangency depends on the shape of the driving force curve, which is
FIGURE 7.19 Schematic K-R curve; Kc occurs at the point of tangency between the driving force and  R curve.
1656_C007.fm  Page 316  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:54 PM
Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 317
governed by the size and geometry of the cracked body. In a laboratory specimen under load control,
for example, Kc would correspond to Pmax in a Type I load-displacement curve (Figure 7.13). Such
a Kc value would exhibit a size dependence similar to that observed for KQ based on a 2% crack
growth criterion, as Figure 7.17 illustrates. Consequently, Kc values obtained from laboratory
specimens are not usually transferable to structures.
7.3.1 S PECIMEN  DESIGN
The ASTM standard for K-R curve testing [14] permits three conﬁgurations of test specimens: the
middle tension (MT) geometry, the conventional compact specimen, and a wedge-loaded compactspecimen. The latter conﬁguration, which is similar to the compact crack-arrest specimen discussedin Section 7.6, is the most stable of the three specimen types, and thus is suitable for materialswith relatively ﬂat  R curves.
Since this test method is often applied to thin sheets, specimens do not usually have the
conventional geometry, with the width equal to twice the thickness. The specimen thickness isnormally ﬁxed by the sheet thickness, and the width is governed by the anticipated toughness ofthe material, as well as the available test ﬁxtures.
A modiﬁed nomenclature is applied to thin-sheet compact specimens. For example, a specimen
with W = 50 mm (2 in.) is designated as a 1T plan specimen, since the in-plane dimensions correspond
to the conventional 1T compact geometry. Standard ﬁxtures can be used to test thin-sheet compactspecimens, provided the specimens are ﬁtted with spacers, as illustrated in Figure 7.20.
One problem with thin sheet fracture toughness testing is that the specimens are subject to out-
of-plane buckling, which leads to combined Mode I–Mode III loading of the crack. Consequently,an antibuckling device should be ﬁtted to the specimen. Figure 7.20 illustrates a typical antibucklingﬁxture for thin-sheet compact specimens. Plates on either side of the specimen prevent out-of-planedisplacements. These plates should not be bolted too tightly together, because loads applied by thetest machine should be carried by the specimen rather than the antibuckling plates. Some type oflubricant (e.g., Teﬂon sheet) is usually required to allow the specimen to slide freely through thetwo plates during the test.

7.3.2 E XPERIMENTAL  MEASUREMENT  OF K-R CURVES
The ASTM Standard E 561 outlines a number of alternative methods for computing both KI and
the crack extension in an  R curve test; the most appropriate approach depends on the relative size
of the plastic zone. Let us ﬁrst consider the special case of negligible plasticity, which exhibits a
load-displacement behavior that is illustrated in Figure 7.21. As the crack grows, the load-displacementcurve deviates from its initial linear shape because the compliance continuously changes. If thespecimen were unloaded prior to fracture, the curve would return to the origin, as the dashed linesindicate. The compliance at any point during the test is equal to the displacement divided by theload. The instantaneous crack length can be inferred from the compliance through relationshipsthat are given in the ASTM standard. See Appendix 7 for compliance-crack length equations fora variety of conﬁgurations. The crack length can also be measured optically during tests on thinsheets, where there is negligible through-thickness variation of crack length. The instantaneousstress intensity is related to the current values of load and crack length:
(7.4)
Consider now the case where a plastic zone forms ahead of the growing crack. The nonlinearity
in the load-displacement curve is caused by a combination of crack growth and plasticity, asFigure 7.22 illustrates. If the specimen is unloaded prior to fracture, the load-displacement curvedoes not return to the origin; crack-tip plasticity produces a ﬁnite amount of permanent deformationin the specimen. The physical crack length can be determined optically or from unloading com-pliance, where the specimen is partially unloaded, the elastic compliance is measured, and the cracklength is inferred from compliance. The stress intensity should be corrected for plasticity effectsby determining an effective crack length. The ASTM standard suggests two alternative approachesfor computing a
eff: the Irwin plastic zone correction and the secant method. According to the Irwin
approach (Section 2.8.1), the effective crack length for plane stress is given by
(7.5)
The secant method consists of determining an effective crack size from the effective compliance,which is equal to the total displacement divided by the load (Figure 7.22). The effective stress-intensityFIGURE 7.21 Load-displacement curve for crack growth in the absence of plasticity.

factor for both methods is computed from the load and the effective crack length:
(7.6)
The Irwin correction requires an iterative calculation, where a ﬁrst-order estimate of aeff is used
to estimate Keff, which is inserted into Equation (7.5) to obtain a new aeff; the process is repeated
until the Keff estimates converge.
The choice of plasticity correction is left largely up to the user. When the plastic zone is small,
ASTM E 561 suggests that the Irwin correction is acceptable, but recommends applying the secant
approach when the crack-tip plasticity is more extensive. Experimental data typically display lesssize dependence when the stress intensity is determined by the secant method [15].
The ASTM  K-R curve standard requires that the stress intensity be plotted against the effective  crack
extension ( ∆a
eff). This practice is inconsistent with the JIc and J-R curve approaches (Section 7.4), where
J is plotted against the physical  crack extension. The estimate of the instability point Kc should not
be sensitive to the way in which the crack growth is quantiﬁed, particularly when both the drivingforce and resistance curves are computed with a consistent deﬁnition of ∆a.
The ASTM E 561 standard does not contain requirements on the specimen size or the maximum
allowable crack extension; thus there is no guarantee that a  K-R curve produced according to this
standard will be a geometry-independent material property. The in-plane dimensions must be largecompared to the plastic zone in order for LEFM to be valid. Also, the growing crack must beremote from all external boundaries.
Unfortunately, the size dependence of  R curves in high strength sheet materials has yet to be
quantiﬁed, so it is not possible to recommend speciﬁc size and crack growth limits for this typeof testing. The user must be aware of the potential for size dependence in  K-R curves. The application
of the secant approach reduces but does not eliminate the size dependence. The user should testwide specimens whenever possible in order to ensure that the laboratory test is indicative of thestructure under consideration.FIGURE 7.22 Load-displacement curve for crack growth with plasticity.

7.4J TESTING OF MET ALS
The current ASTM standard that covers J-integral testing is E 1820 [4]. This standard is actually
a generalized fracture toughness standard, as it also covers KIc and CTOD tests. The British Standard
BS 7448: Part 1 [10] is equivalent in scope to ASTM E 1820.
ASTM E 1820 has two alternative methods for J tests: the basic procedure and the resistance
curve procedure. The basic procedure entails monotonically loading the specimen to failure or to a
particular displacement, depending on the material behavior. The resistance curve procedure requiresthat the crack growth be monitored during the test. The J integral is calculated incrementally in the
resistance curve procedure. The basic procedure can be used to measure J at fracture instability or
near the onset of ductile crack extension. The latter toughness value is designated by the symbol J
Ic.
7.4.1 T HE BASIC TEST PROCEDURE  AND JIc MEASUREMENTS
Measuring toughness near the onset of ductile crack extension JIc requires the determination of a
J resistance curve. If the basic procedure is used to generate such a resistance curve, the J values
on the R curve may be subject to error because they have not been corrected for crack growth. Thisis of little consequence when measuring J
Ic, however, because the purpose of the R curve in this
instance is to extrapolate back to a J value where ∆a is small and a crack growth correction is not
necessary. If a J-R curve is to be used in a tearing instability analysis (see Chapter 9), the test
procedure in Section 7.4.2 should be applied.
Because crack growth is not monitored as a part of the basic test procedure, a multiple-specimen
technique is normally required to obtain a J-R curve. In such cases, a series of nominally identical
specimens are loaded to various levels and then unloaded. Different amounts of crack growth occurin the various specimens. The crack growth in each sample is marked by heat tinting or fatiguecracking after the test. Each specimen is then broken open and the crack extension is measured. 
In addition to measuring crack growth, a  J value must be computed for each specimen in order
to generate the  R curve. For estimation purposes, it is convenient to divide  J into elastic and plastic
components:
(7.7)
The elastic  J is computed from the elastic stress intensity:
(7.8)
where  K is inferred from the load and crack size through Equation (7.4). If, however, side-grooved
specimens are used, the expression for  K is modiﬁed:
(7.9)
where B is the gross thickness and B
N is the net thickness (Figure 7.12). The basic procedure in
ASTM E 1820 includes a simpliﬁed method for computing  Jpl from the plastic area under the load-
displacement curve:3
(7.10)
3 Since J is deﬁned in terms of the energy absorbed divided by the net cross-sectional area, BN appears in the denominator.

Figure 7.23), and bo is the initial ligament length. For an SE(B) specimen,

and for a compact specimen,
(7.11b)
Recall from Section 3.2.5 that Equation (7.10) was derived from the energy release rate deﬁnition
of J.
Note that Equation (7.10) and Equation (7.11b) do not correct  J for crack growth, but are based
on the initial crack length. The resistance curve procedure described in Section 7.4.2, in which  J
is computed incrementally with updated values of crack length and ligament length, can also beapplied. This more elaborate procedure is usually not necessary for J
Ic measurements, however,
because the crack growth is insigniﬁcant at the point on the R curve where JIc is measured. In the
limit of a stationary crack, both formulas give identical results.
The ASTM procedure for computing JQ, a provisional JIc, from the  R curve is illustrated in
Figure 7.24. Exclusion lines are drawn at crack extension ( ∆a) values of 0.15 and 1.5 mm. These
lines have a slope of MσY, where σY is the ﬂow stress, deﬁned as the average of the yield and
tensile strengths. The slope of the exclusion lines is intended to represent the component of crackextension that is due to crack blunting, as opposed to ductile tearing. The value of M can be
determined experimentally, or a default value of 2 can be used. A horizontal exclusion line isdeﬁned at a maximum value of  J:
(7.12)
All data that fall within the exclusion limits are ﬁt to a power-law expression:

Q is deﬁned as the intersection between Equation (7.13) and a 0.2-mm offset line. If all
other validity criteria are met, JQ = JIc as long as the following size requirements are satisﬁed:

EXAMPLE 7.3
Estimate the specimen size requirements for a valid JIc test on the material in Example 7.1. Assume
σTS = 450 MPa and E = 207,000 MPa.
Solution : First we must convert the KIc value in Example 7.1 to an equivalent JIc:
Substituting the above result into Equation (7.14) gives
which is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the specimen dimension that ASTM E 399 requires
for this material. Thus, the JIc size requirements are much more lenient than the KIc requirements.
7.4.2J-R CURVE TESTING
The resistance curve test method in ASTM E 1820 requires that crack growth be monitored throughout
the test. One disadvantage of this test method is that additional instrumentation is required. However,this complication is more than offset by the fact that the J-R curve can be obtained from a single
specimen. Determining a J-R curve with the basic method requires tests on multiple specimens.FIGURE 7.24 Determination of JQ from a J-R curve. Taken from E 1820-01, ‘‘Standard Test Method for

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 323
The most common single-specimen test technique is the unloading compliance method,
which is illustrated in Figure 7.25. The crack length is computed at regular intervals during the
test by partially unloading the specimen and measuring the compliance. As the crack grows,the specimen becomes more compliant (less stiff). The various J testing standards provide
polynomial expressions that relate a/W to compliance. Table A7.3 in Appendix 7 lists these
compliance equations for bend and compact specimens. The ASTM standard requires relativelydeep cracks (0.50 ≤ a/W < 0.70) because the unloading compliance technique is less sensitive
for a/W < 0.5. 
An alternative single-specimen test method is the potential drop procedure (Figure 7.10) in
which crack growth is monitored through the change in electrical resistance that accompanies aloss in cross-sectional area. 
A third option for monitoring crack growth during a J test is the normalization method [4, 16],
which entails inferring the crack growth from the load-displacement curve. A specimen in whichthe crack is growing goes through a maximum load plateau followed by a decrease in load, but theload-displacement curve would continually rise in the absence of crack growth. The normalizationmethod is particularly useful for high loading rates, where techniques such as unloading complianceare not possible.
When determining the J resistance curve for a given material, the specimens should be side-
grooved to avoid shear lips and crack tunneling. Proper side-grooving will also produce relativelyuniform ductile crack extension along the crack front.
There are a number of ways to compute  J for a growing crack, as outlined in Section 3.4.2.
The ASTM procedure for J-R curve testing utilizes the deformation  theory deﬁnition of J, which
corresponds to the rate of energy dissipation by the growing crack (i.e., the energy release rate).Recall Figure 3.22, which contrasts the actual loading path with the ‘‘deformation’’ path. Thedeformation J is related to the area under the load-displacement curve for a stationary crack, rather
than the area under the actual load-displacement curve, where the crack length varies (see Equation(3.55) and Equation (3.56)).
Since the crack length changes continuously during a  J-R curve test, the  J integral must be
calculated incrementally. For unloading compliance tests, the most logical time to update the  J
value is at each unloading point, where the crack length is also updated. Consider a J test with n
measuring points. For a given measuring point i, where , the elastic and plastic componentsFIGURE 7.25 The unloading compliance method for monitoring crack growth.

of J can be estimated from the following expressions (see Figure 7.26):

where ∆i(pl) is the plastic load-line displacement, γi = 1.0 for SE(B) specimens and γi = 1 + 0.76

Earlier J testing standards were restricted only to materials that exhibit ductile crack extension and
a rising resistance curve. ASTM E 1820, however, also covers tests that terminate in an unstableFIGURE 7.26 Schematic load-displacement curve for a J-R curve test.

fracture event, such as cleavage in steels. Either the basic or resistance curve test procedure may
be applied to materials that exhibit unstable fracture.
The value of J at the point of unstable fracture is designated JQc, a provisional fracture toughness.
If certain validity criterion are met, JQc = Jc. The specimen size requirement for Jc is as follows:
(7.18)
where λ is a dimensionless constant. If the material is a ferritic steel with tensile properties within
a certain range, λ = 50. Otherwise, λ = 100. The second validity criterion for Jc is the maximum
allowable stable crack extension prior to stable fracture:
(7.19)
where  is the slope of the blunting line, as illustrated in Figure 7.24. Unless the blunting lineslope has been experimentally determined for the material, M is normally assumed to equal 2.
If a test exhibits a signiﬁcant stable crack growth prior to ﬁnal fracture, such that Equation
(7.19) is not satisﬁed, the J value at fracture instability is designated as J
u. There are no specimen
size requirements for Ju. If the resistance curve test method is used such that crack growth is
monitored prior to ultimate failure, it may be possible to construct a J-R curve and compute JIc. 
The size requirement for Jc is intended to ensure that the specimen has sufﬁcient crack-tip
triaxiality, and that further increases in size would not signiﬁcantly affect the triaxiality. However,J
c values may still exhibit specimen size dependence. In ferritic steels, for example, there is a
statistical size effect on fracture toughness because the probability of cleavage fracture is relatedto the length of the crack front. An ASTM toughness test method speciﬁcally for ferritic steels inthe ductile-brittle transition range, E 1921 [18], addresses this phenomenon. See Section 7.8 formore information about ASTM E 1921.FIGURE 7.27 J-R curve for A 710 steel [17]. In this case, the data exceed the maximum J (Equation (7.16))
before the crack growth limit (Equation (7.17)).

The sensitivity of Ju values to specimen size has not been fully quantiﬁed. Consequently, ASTM
warns that such values may be size dependent.
7.5 CT OD TESTING
The ﬁrst  CTOD test standard was published in Great Britain in 1979 [19]. Several years later,
ASTM published E 1290, an American version of the  CTOD standard. ASTM E 1290 has been
revised several times, and the most recent version (as of this writing) was published in 2002 [20].
The original British CTOD test standard has been superceded by BS 7448 [10], which combinesK, J, and CTOD testing into a single standard. ASTM E 1820 [4] also combined these three crack-
tip parameters into a single testing standard, but E 1290 is still maintained by the ASTM CommitteeE08 on Fatigue and Fracture. The CTOD test methods in E 1290 and E 1820 are similar, but thelatter standard includes provisions for generating a CTOD resistance curve. The discussion in thissection focuses primarily on the ASTM E 1820 test method.
ASTM E 1820 includes both a basic and resistance curve procedure for CTOD, much like the
J test methodology in this standard. The test method in E 1290 is comparable to the basic procedure.The basic procedure, where stable crack growth is not considered in the analysis, is described next.This is followed by a description of the CTOD resistance curve procedure.
Experimental  CTOD estimates are made by separating the  CTOD into elastic and plastic
components, similar to J tests. The elastic  CTOD is obtained from the elastic K:
(7.20)
The elastic  K is related to applied load through Equation (7.4). The above relationship assumes
that d
n = 0.5 for linear elastic conditions (Equation (3.48)). The plastic component of  CTOD is
obtained by assuming that the test specimen rotates about a plastic hinge. This concept is illustratedin Figure 7.28 for an SE(B) specimen. The plastic displacement at the crack mouth, V
p, is related
to the plastic  CTOD through a similar triangles construction:

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 327
where rp is the plastic rotational factor, a constant between 0 and 1 that deﬁnes the relative position
of the apparent hinge point. The mouth-opening displacement is measured with a clip gage. In the
case of an SE(B) specimen, knife edges are often attached in order to hold the clip gage, so thatEquation (7.21) must take account of the knife-edge height z. The compact specimen is usually
designed such that z = 0. The plastic component of V is obtained from the load-displacement curve
by constructing a line parallel to the elastic loading line, as illustrated in Figure 3.6. The plasticrotational factor is given by
(7.22a)
for the SE(B) specimen and
(7.22b)
for the compact specimen. The original British standard for  CTOD tests, BS 5762:1979, applied
only to SE(B) specimens and speciﬁed r
p = 0.40.
The crack-mouth-opening displacement V on an SE(B) specimen is not the same as the load-
line displacement ∆. The latter displacement measurement is required for  J estimation because Apl
in Figure 7.23 represents the plastic energy absorbed by the specimen. The  CTOD standard utilizes
Vp because this displacement is easier to measure in SE(B) specimens. If rp is known, however, it
is possible to infer  J from a P-V curve or  CTOD from a P-∆ curve [5, 6]. The compact specimen
simpliﬁes matters somewhat because  V = ∆ as long as z = 0.
When using the resistance curve procedure in ASTM E 1820, the CTOD equation must
continually be updated with the current crack size. For the ith measurement point in the test, CTOD
is given by
(7.23)
where ai is the current crack length and . The stress-intensity factor  is computed
using the current crack length. For compact specimens, the rotational factor must also be continuallyupdated to account for crack growth:
(7.24)
Equation (7.23) and Equation (7.24) do not appear in ASTM E 1290.
When the material exhibits ductile crack extension, the above procedure can be used to generate
a d-R curve. The CTOD near the onset of ductile crack extension, d
Ic, can be inferred from the
resistance curve in a manner very similar to the JIc measurement (Figure 7.24). The slope of the
blunting line and exclusion lines for a d-R curve is Mδ, where Mδ is assumed to equal 1.4 unless
an experimental measurement of the blunting line slope has been made. The provisional initiationtoughness d
Q is deﬁned at the intersection between the d-R curve, deﬁned by a power-law ﬁt withinrp=04 4.

the exclusion lines, and a 0.2-mm offset line with a slope of Mδ. The size requirement for a valid
dIc is given by
(7.25)
The basic procedure can be used to measure dIc, but multiple specimens are required to deﬁne a
d-R curve. ASTM E 1290 does not provide a procedure to measure dIc.
For tests that terminate in unstable fracture, such as cleavage in ferritic steels, the symbols dc
and du are assigned to the resulting CTOD values. The appropriate symbol depends on whether or
not the fracture instability was preceded by signiﬁcant stable crack extension, as is the case with
Jc and Ju measurements in E 1820. When assessing toughness in accordance to ASTM E 1820, the
du label applies when . In ASTM E 1290, fracture instability toughness is
designated as du when . When , ASTM E 1820 imposes the
following size requirement on dc:
(7.26)
This size requirement is approximately two to four times more stringent than the requirement onJ
c (Equation (7.19)). It is likely that a future revision of ASTM E 1820 will relax the CTOD size
requirement to make it consistent with the Jc size requirement. ASTM E 1290 does not have a size
requirement on dc.
When applying the basic test method to a ductile material that does not exhibit fracture instability,
it is usually not possible to infer a d-R curve or dIc, but the value of CTOD at the maximum load
plateau, dm, can be reported. This maximum load point is the result of competition between strain
hardening, which causes the load to increase with deformation, and ductile crack growth, whichreduces the cross section of the specimen. The CTOD at maximum load in a ductile material givesa relative indication of toughness, but d
m values are highly dependent on specimen size.
Figure 7.29 is a series of schematic load-displacement curves that illustrate a variety of failure
scenarios. Curve (a) illustrates a test that results in a dc value; unstable fracture occurs at Pc. Figure 7.29(b)
corresponds to a du result, where ductile tearing precedes unstable fracture. The ductile crack growth

initiates at Pi. A test on a fully ductile material, such as steel on the upper shelf, produces a load-
displacement curve like Figure 7.29(c); a maximum load plateau occurs at Pm. The specimen is
still stable after maximum load if the test is performed in displacement control. Three types of
CTOD result, dc, du, and dm, are mutually exclusive, i.e., they cannot occur in the same test. 
As Figure 7.29 illustrates, there is usually no detectable change in the load-displacement
curve at the onset of ductile crack extension. The only deviation in the load-displacementbehavior is the reduced rate of increase in load as the crack grows. The maximum load plateau(Figure 7.29(c)) occurs when the rate of strain hardening is exactly balanced by the rate ofdecrease in the cross section. However, the initiation of crack growth cannot be detected from theload-displacement curve because the loss of cross section is gradual. Thus d
Ic must be determined
from an  R curve.
7.6 DYN AMIC AND CRACK-ARREST TOUGHNESS
When a material is subject to a rapidly applied load or a rapidly propagating crack, the responseof that material may be drastically different from the quasistatic case. When rapid loading orunstable crack propagation are likely to occur in practice, it is important to duplicate these conditionswhen measuring material properties in the laboratory.
The dynamic fracture toughness and the crack-arrest toughness are two important material prop-
erties for many applications. The dynamic fracture toughness is a measure of the resistance of a materialto crack propagation under rapid loading, while the crack-arrest toughness quantiﬁes the ability of amaterial to stop a rapidly propagating crack. In the latter case, the crack may initiate  under either
dynamic or quasistatic conditions, but unstable propagation  is generally a dynamic phenomenon.
Dynamic fracture problems are often complicated by inertia effects, material rate dependence,
and reﬂected stress waves. One or more of these effects can be neglected in some cases, however.Refer to Chapter 4 for an additional discussion on this subject.
7.6.1 R APID LOADING  IN FRACTURE  TESTING
Some testing standards, including ASTM E 399 [8] and E 1820 [4] include annexes for fracturetoughness testing at high loading rates. This type of testing is more difﬁcult than conventionalfracture toughness measurements, and requires considerably more instrumentation.
High loading rates can be achieved in the laboratory by a number of means, including a drop tower,
a high-rate testing machine, and explosive loading. With a drop tower, the load is imparted to thespecimen through the force of gravity; a crosshead with a known weight is dropped onto the specimenfrom a speciﬁc height. A pendulum device such as a Charpy-testing machine is a variation of thisprinciple. Some servo-hydraulic machines are capable of high displacement rates. While conventionaltesting machines are closed loop , where the hydraulic ﬂuid circulates through the system, high-rate
machines are open loop, where a single burst of hydraulic pressure is released over a short time interval.
For moderately high displacement rates, a closed-loop machine may be adequate. Explosive loadinginvolves setting off a controlled charge that sends stress waves through the specimen [21].
The dynamic loads resulting from impact are often inferred from an instrumented tup. Alter-
natively, strain gages can be mounted directly on the specimen; the output can be calibrated forload measurements, provided the gages are placed in a region of the specimen that remains elasticduring the test. Crosshead displacements can be measured directly through an optical devicemounted to the cross head. If this instrumentation is not available, a load-time curve can be convertedto a load-displacement curve through momentum transfer relationships.
Certain applications require more advanced optical techniques, such as photoelasticity [22, 23] and
the method of caustics [24]. These procedures provide more detailed information about the deformationof the specimen, but are also more complicated than global measurements of load and displacement.1656_C007.fm  Page 329  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:54 PM
330 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Because high-rate fracture tests typically last only a few milliseconds, conventional data acqui-
sition tools are inadequate. A storage oscilloscope has traditionally been required to capture data
in a high-rate test; when a computer data acquisition system was used, the data were downloadedfrom the oscilloscope after the test. The newest generation of data acquisition cards for PCs removesthe need for this two-step process. These cards are capable of collecting data at high rates, andenable the computer to simulate the functions of an oscilloscope.
Inertia effects can severely complicate the measurement of the relevant fracture parameters.
The stress-intensity factor and  J integral cannot be inferred from global loads and displacements
when there is a signiﬁcant kinetic energy component. Optical methods such as photoelasticity andcaustics are necessary to measure  J and K in such cases.
The transition time concept [25,26], which was introduced in Chapter 4, removes much of the
complexity associated with  J and K determination in high-rate tests. Recall that the transition time
t
τ is deﬁned as the time at which the kinetic energy and deformation energy are approximately
equal. At times much less than tτ, inertia effects dominate, while inertia is negligible at times
signiﬁcantly greater than tτ. The latter case corresponds to essentially quasistatic conditions, where
conventional equations for  J and K apply. According to Figure 4.4, the quasistatic equation for J,
based on the global load-displacement curve, is accurate at times greater that 2tτ. Thus, if the
critical fracture event occurs after 2tτ, the toughness can be inferred from the conventional quasi-
static relationships. For drop tower tests on ductile materials, the transition time requirement isrelatively easy to meet [27,28]. For brittle materials (which fail sooner) or higher loading rates,the transition time can be shortened through specimen design.
7.6.2KIa MEASUREMENTS
In order to measure arrest toughness in a laboratory specimen, one must create conditions underwhich a crack initiates, propagates in an unstable manner, and then arrests. Unstable propagationfollowed by arrest can be achieved either through a rising  R curve or a falling driving force curve.
In the former case, a temperature gradient across a steel specimen produces the desired result;fracture can be initiated on the cold side of the specimen, where toughness is low, and propagateinto warmer material where arrest is likely. A falling driving force can be obtained by loading thespecimen in displacement control, as Example 2.3 illustrates.
The Robertson crack-arrest test [29] was one of the earliest applications of the temperature-
gradient approach. This test is only qualitative, however, since the arrest temperature, rather thanK
Ia, is determined from this test. The temperature at which a crack arrests in the Robertson specimen
is only indicative of the relative arrest toughness of the material; designing above this temperaturedoes not guarantee crack arrest under all loading conditions. The drop weight test; developed byPellini (see Section 7.9) is another qualitative arrest test that yields a critical temperature. In thiscase, however, arrest is accomplished through a falling driving force.
While most crack-arrest tests are performed on small laboratory specimens, a limited number
of experiments have been performed on larger conﬁgurations in order to validate the small-scaledata. An extreme example of large-scale testing is the wide plate crack-arrest experiments conductedat the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
4 in Gaithersburg, Maryland [30].
Figure 7.30 shows a photograph of the NIST testing machine and one of the crack-arrest specimens.This specimen, which is a single-edge notched tensile panel, is 10 m long by 1 m wide. Atemperature gradient is applied across the width, such that the initial crack is at the cold end. Thespecimen is then loaded until unstable cleavage occurs. These specimens are heavily instrumented,so that a variety of information can be inferred from each test. The crack-arrest toughness valuesmeasured from these tests are in broad agreement with small-scale specimen data.
4 NIST was formerly known as the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), which explains the initials on either end of the
specimen in Figure 7.30.1656_C007.fm  Page 330  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:54 PM
Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 331
In 1988, ASTM published a standard for crack-arrest testing, E 1221 [31]. This standard outlines a
test procedure that is considerably more modest than the NIST experiments. A side-grooved compact
crack-arrest specimen is wedge loaded until unstable fracture occurs. Because the specimen is held ata constant crack-mouth-opening displacement, the running crack experiences a falling  K ﬁeld. The crack-
arrest toughness K
Ia is determined from the mouth-opening displacement and the arrested crack length.
The test specimen and loading apparatus for KIa testing are illustrated in Figure 7.31 and
Figure 7.32. In most cases, a starter notch is placed in a brittle weld bead in order to facilitateFIGURE 7.30 Photograph of a wide plate crack arrest test performed at NIST. Photograph provided by J.G.

A clip gage measures the displacement at the crack mouth (Figure 7.33).
Since the load normal to the crack plane is not measured in these tests, the stress intensity must
be inferred from the clip-gage displacement. The estimation of  K is complicated, however, by
extraneous displacements, such as seating of the wedge/pin assembly. Also, local yielding can occurnear the starter notch prior to fracture initiation. The ASTM standard outlines a cyclic loadingprocedure for identifying these displacements; Figure 7.33 shows a schematic load-displacementcurve that illustrates this method. The specimen is ﬁrst loaded to a predetermined displacementand, assuming the crack has not initiated, the specimen is unloaded. The displacement at zero loadis assumed to represent the effects of ﬁxture seating, and this component is subtracted from theFIGURE 7.31 Apparatus for KIa tests.

total displacement when stress intensity is computed. The specimen is reloaded to a somewhat
higher displacement and then unloaded; this process continues until fracture initiates. The zero loadoffset displacements that occur after the ﬁrst cycle can be considered to be due to notch-tip plasticity.The correct way to treat this displacement component in  K calculations is unclear at present. Once
the crack propagates through the plastic zone, the plastic displacement is largely recovered (i.e.,converted into an elastic displacement), and thus may contribute to the driving force. It is not knownwhether or not there is sufﬁcient time for this displacement component to exert an inﬂuence onthe running crack. The ASTM standard takes the middle ground on this question, and requires thathalf of the plastic offset be included in the stress-intensity calculations.
After the test, the specimen should be heat tinted at 250 –350 °C for 10–90 min to mark the
crack propagation. When the specimen is broken open, the arrested crack length can then bemeasured on the fracture surface. The critical stress intensity at initiation K
o is computed from the
initial crack size and the critical clip-gage displacement. The provisional arrest toughness Ka is
calculated from the ﬁnal crack size, assuming a constant displacement. These calculations assume
quasistatic conditions. As discussed in Chapter 4, this assumption can lead to underestimates ofarrest toughness. The ASTM standard, however, cites experimental evidence that implies that theerrors introduced by a quasistatic assumption are small in this case [32,33].FIGURE 7.32 Side-grooved compact crack-arrest specimen.

In order for the test to be valid, the crack propagation and arrest should occur under predom-
inantly plane strain linear elastic conditions. The following validity requirements in ASTM E 1221
are designed to ensure that the plastic zone is small compared to specimen dimensions, and thatthe crack jump length is within acceptable limits:
(7.27a)
(7.27b)
(7.27c)
(7.27d)
where 
a
a = arrested crack length
ao = initial crack length
σYd = assumed dynamic yield strength 
which the ASTM standard speciﬁes at 205 MPa (30 ksi) above the quasistatic value. Since unstablecrack propagation results in very high strain rates, the recommended estimate of 
σYd is probably
very conservative.
If the above validity requirements are satisﬁed and all other provisions of ASTM E 1221 are
followed, Ka = KIa.
7.7 FRA CTURE TESTING OF WELDMENTS
All of the test methods discussed so far are suitable for specimens extracted from uniform sectionsof homogeneous material. Welded joints, however, have decidedly heterogeneous microstructuresand, in many cases, irregular shapes. Weldments also contain complex residual stress distributions.Most existing fracture toughness testing standards do not address the special problems associatedwith weldment testing. An exception is Part 2 of British Standard 7448 [34]. This test methodreﬂects practical experience that has been gained over the years [35–37].
The factors that make weldment testing difﬁcult (i.e., heterogeneous microstructures, irregular
shapes, and residual stresses) also tend to increase the risk of brittle fracture in welded structures.Thus, one cannot simply evaluate the regions of a structure where ASTM testing standards apply,and ignore the fracture properties of weldments.
When performing fracture toughness tests on weldments, a number of factors need special
consideration. Specimen design and fabrication are more difﬁcult because of the irregular shapesand curved surfaces associated with some welded joints. The heterogeneous microstructure of typicalweldments requires special attention to the location of the notch in the test specimen. Residualstresses make fatigue precracking of weldment specimens more difﬁcult. After the test, a weldmentmay be sectioned and examined metallographically to determine whether or not the fatigue cracksampled the intended microstructure.
7.7.1 S PECIMEN  DESIGN AND FABRICATION
The underlying philosophy of the British Standards test procedure on specimen design and fabri-cation is that the specimen thickness should be as close to the section thickness as possible. Largerspecimens tend to produce more crack-tip constraint, and hence lower toughness (see Chapter 2Wa Wa−≥ 01 5.

and Chapter 3). Achieving nearly full-thickness weldment often requires sacriﬁces in other areas.
For example, if a specimen is to be extracted from a curved section such as a pipe, one can eitherproduce a sub-size rectangular specimen that meets the tolerances of the existing ASTM standards,or a full-thickness specimen that is curved. 
If curvature or distortion of a weldment is excessive, the specimen can be straightened by
bending on either side of the notch to produce a ‘‘gull wing’’ conﬁguration, which is illustrated inFigure 7.34. The bending must be performed so that the three loading points (in an SE(B) specimen)are aligned.
The fabrication of either a compact or SE(B) weldment specimen is possible, but the SE(B)
specimen is preferable in most cases. Although the compact specimen consumes less material (fora given B and W) in parent metal tests, it requires more weld metal in a through-thickness orientation
(L-T or T-L) than an SE(B) specimen (Figure 7.2). It is impractical to use a compact geometry for
surface-notched specimens ( T-S or L-S); such a specimen would be greatly undersized with the
standard B × 2B geometry.
7.7.2 N OTCH LOCATION  AND ORIENTATION
Weldments have a highly heterogeneous microstructure. Fracture toughness can vary considerablyover relatively short distances. Thus, it is important to take great care in locating the fatigue crackin the correct region. If the fracture toughness test is designed to simulate an actual structural ﬂaw,the fatigue crack must sample the same microstructure as the ﬂaw. For a weld procedure qualiﬁcationor a general assessment of a weldment’s fracture toughness, location of the crack in the most brittleregion may be desirable, but it is difﬁcult to know in advance which region of the weld has thelowest toughness. In typical C–Mn structural steels, low toughness is usually associated with thecoarse-grained heat-affected zone (HAZ) and the intercritically reheated HAZ. A microhardnesssurvey can help identify low toughness regions because high hardness is often coincident withbrittle behavior. The safest approach is to perform fracture toughness tests on a variety of regionsin a weldment.
Once the microstructure of interest is identiﬁed, a notch orientation must be selected. The two
most common alternatives are a through-thickness notch and a surface notch, which are illustrated inFigure 7.35. Since full-thickness specimens are desired, the surface-notched specimen should be asquare section ( B × B), while the through-thickness notch will usually be in a rectangular ( B × 2B)
specimen.
For weld metal testing, the through-thickness orientation is usually preferable because a variety
of regions in the weld are sampled. However, there may be cases where the surface-notchedspecimen is the most suitable for testing the weld metal. For example, a surface notch can samplea particular region of the weld metal, such as the root or cap, or the notch can be located in aparticular microstructure, such as unreﬁned weld metal.
Notch location in the HAZ often depends on the type of weldment. If welds are produced solely
for mechanical testing, for example, as part of a weld procedure qualiﬁcation or a research program,FIGURE 7.34 The gull-wing conﬁguration for weldment specimens with excessive curvature. Taken from
Dawes, M.G., Pisarski, H.G., and Squirrell, H.G., ‘‘Fracture Mechanics Tests on Welded Joints.’’ ASTM STP

336 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
the welded joint can be designed to facilitate HAZ testing. Figure 7.36 illustrates the  K and half-
K preparations, which simulate double- V and single- V welds, respectively. The plates should be
tilted when these weldments are made, to have the same angle of attack for the electrode as in an
actual single- or double- V joint. For fracture toughness testing, a through-thickness notch is placed
in the straight side of the  K or half- K HAZ.
In many instances, fracture toughness testing must be performed on an actual production
weldment, where the joint geometry is governed by the structural design. In such cases, a surfacenotch is often necessary for the crack to sample sufﬁcient HAZ material. The measured toughnessis sensitive to the volume of HAZ material sampled by the crack tip because of the weakest-linknature of cleavage fracture (see Chapter 5). 
Another application of the surface-notched orientation is the simulation of structural ﬂaws.
Figure 7.37 illustrates HAZ ﬂaws in a structural weld and a surface-notched fracture toughnessspecimen that models one of the ﬂaws.
Figure 7.37 demonstrates the advantages of allowing a range of a/W ratios in surface-
notched specimens. A shallow notch is often required to locate a crack in the desired region,but most existing ASTM standards do not allow a/W ratios less than 0.45. Shallow-notched
fracture toughness specimens tend to have lower constraint than deeply cracked specimens, asFIGURE 7.35 Notch orientation in weldment specimens. (a) through-thickness notch and (b) surface notch.

Figure 3.28 and Figure 3.44, illustrate. Thus, there is a conﬂict between the need to simulate a
structural condition and the traditional fracture mechanics approach, where a toughness value issupposed to be a size-independent material property. One way to resolve this conﬂict is throughconstraint corrections, such as that applied to the data in Figure 3.44 and Figure 3.45.
7.7.3 F ATIGUE  PRECRACKING
Weldments that have not been stress relieved typically contain complex residual stress distributionsthat interfere with fatigue precracking of fracture toughness specimens. Tensile residual stressesaccelerate fatigue crack initiation and growth, but compressive stresses retard fatigue. Since residualstresses vary through the cross section, fatigue crack fronts in as-welded samples are typically verynonuniform.
Towers and Dawes [38] evaluated the various methods for producing straight fatigue cracks in
welded specimens, including reverse bending, high  R ratio, and local compression.
The ﬁrst method bends the specimen in the opposite direction to the normal loading conﬁgu-
ration to produce residual tensile stresses along the crack front that counterbalance the compressivestresses. Although this technique gives some improvement, it does not usually produce acceptablefatigue crack fronts.
The R ratio in fatigue cracking is the ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum. A high
R ratio minimizes the effect of residual stresses on fatigue, but also tends to increase the apparent
toughness of the specimen. In addition, fatigue precracking at a high  R ratio takes much longer
than precracking at  R= 0.1, the recommended  R ratio of the various ASTM fracture-testing
standards.
The only method that Towers and Dawes evaluated that produced consistently straight
fatigue cracks was local compression, where the ligament is compressed to produce nominally1% plastic strain through the thickness, mechanically relieving the residual stresses. However,local compression can reduce the toughness slightly. Towers and Dawes concluded that thebeneﬁts of local compression outweigh the disadvantages, particularly in the absence of aviable alternative.
7.7.4 P OSTTEST  ANALYSIS
Correct placement of a fatigue crack in weld metal is usually not difﬁcult because this region isrelatively homogeneous. The microstructure in the HAZ, however, can change dramatically oververy small distances. Correct placement of a fatigue crack in the HAZ is often accomplished byFIGURE 7.37 Test specimen with notch orientation and depth that matches a ﬂaw in a structure. (a) weldment
with a ﬂaw in the HAZ and (b) test specimen with simulated structural ﬂaw. Taken from Dawes, M.G., Pisarski,

338 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
trial and error. Because fatigue cracks are usually slightly bowed, the precise location of the crack
tip in the center of a specimen cannot be inferred from observations on the surface of the specimen.Thus, HAZ fracture toughness specimens should be examined metallographically after the test todetermine the microstructure that initiated fracture. In certain cases, a posttest examination maybe required in weld metal specimens.
Figure 7.38 illustrates a procedure for sectioning surface-notched and through-thickness-
notched specimens [35]. First, the origin of the fracture must be located by the chevron markingson the fracture surface. After marking the origin with a small spot of paint, the specimen issectioned perpendicular to the fracture surface and examined metallographically. The specimenshould be sectioned slightly to one side of the origin and polished down to the initiation site.The spot of paint appears on the polished specimen when the origin is reached.
The API document RP2Z [37] outlines a posttest analysis of HAZ specimens, which is more
detailed and cumbersome than the procedure outlined above. In addition to sectioning the specimen,the amount of coarse-grained material at the crack tip must be quantiﬁed. For the test to be valid,at least 15% of the crack front must be in the coarse-grained HAZ. The purpose of this procedureis to prequalify steels with respect to HAZ toughness, identifying those that produce low HAZtoughness so that they can be rejected before fabrication.
7.8 TESTING AND ANAL YSIS OF STEELS IN THE DUCTILE-BRITTLE 
TRANSITION REGION
Chapter 5 described the micromechanisms of cleavage fracture, and indicated that cleavage tough-ness data tend to be highly scattered, especially in the transition region. Because of this substantialscatter, data should be treated statistically rather than deterministically. That is, a given steel doesnot have a single value of toughness at a particular temperature in the transition region; rather, thematerial has a toughness distribution . Testing numerous specimens to obtain a statistical distribution
can be expensive and time consuming. Fortunately, a methodology has been developed that greatlysimpliﬁes this process for ferritic steels. A relatively new ASTM standard for the ductile-brittletransition region, E 1921 [18], implements this methodology.FIGURE 7.38 Posttest sectioning of a weldment fracture toughness specimen to identify the microstructure
that caused fracture.

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 339
Research over the past 20 years into the fracture of ferritic steels in the ductile-brittle transition
region has led to two important conclusions:
1. Scatter in fracture toughness data in the transition region follows a characteristic statis-
tical distribution that is the same for all ferritic steels.
2. The shape of the fracture toughness vs. temperature curve in the transition range is
virtually identical for all ferritic steels. The only difference between steels is the absolute
position of this curve on the temperature axis.
The term Fracture Toughness Master Curve  [39–41] was coined to describe these two characteristics
of steel. ASTM E 1921 outlines a fracture toughness test method that is based on the master curve concept.
Due to the idiosyncrasies of the micromechanism of cleavage fracture (Chapter 5), the fracture
toughness at a ﬁxed temperature in the transition region follows a 3-parameter Weibull distribution witha slope of 4:
(7.28)
where
F = cumulative probability
B = specimen thickness in millimeters
K
Jc = fracture toughness (critical J converted to the equivalent critical K) in MPa  
Kmin = threshold toughness
Ko = Weibull mean toughness, which corresponds to the 63rd percentile toughness for a 25-mm 
(1 in.) thick specimen
ASTM E 1920 ﬁxes Kmin at 20 MPa  (18.2 ksi .). Therefore, Equation (7.28) has only one
unspeciﬁed parameter Ko. A statistical distribution that contains only one parameter can be ﬁt with
a relatively small sample size.
The thickness dependence in Equation (7.28) stems from statistical sampling effects. Cleavage
fracture occurs by a weakest-link mechanism, and toughness tends to decrease with increasingcrack front length.
5 Toughness data for various thicknesses can be converted to equivalent values
for a 25-mm thick (i.e., standard 1T) specimen using the following relationship:
(7.29)
Once toughness values at a ﬁxed temperature have been converted to 1T equivalent values
using Equation (7.29), the Weibull mean toughness Ko can be computed as follows:
(7.30)
where N is the number of valid tests in the data set. The median toughness for a 1T specimen at
a ﬁxed temperature is related to the Weibull mean as follows:
(7.31)
5 When assessing a ﬂaw in a structural component, B is the crack front length, which generally is not equal to the section
thickness.FBKK

340 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
According to the master curve model, the temperature dependence of median toughness in the
ductile-brittle transition region is given by
(7.32)
where To is a reference transition temperature in °C and the units of KJc are . At T = To,
the median fracture toughness = 100 . Once To is known for a given material, the fracture
toughness distribution can be inferred as a function of temperature through Equation (7.28) and
Equation (7.32).
The ﬁrst step in determining To is to perform replicate fracture toughness tests at a constant
temperature. ASTM E 1921 recommends at least six such tests. Next, the data are converted toequivalent 1T values using Equation (7.29). These data are then put into Equation (7.30) todetermine K
o at the test temperature. The median toughness at this temperature is computed from
Equation (7.31). Finally, To is computed by rearranging Equation (7.32):
(7.33)
ASTM E 1921 provides an alternative method for determining To when KJc data are obtained at
multiple temperatures.
Figure 7.39 schematically illustrates the fracture toughness master curve for a particular steel.
By combining Equation (7.28) and Equation (7.32), it is possible to infer median, upper-bound andlower-bound toughness as a function of temperature.
The Master Curve approach works best in the ductile-brittle transition region. It may not ﬁt
data in the lower shelf very well, and it is totally unsuitable for the upper shelf. Equation (7.32)increases without bound with increasing temperature, and thus does not model the upper shelf.
7.9 QUALITA TIVE T OUGHNESS TESTS
Before the development of formal fracture mechanics methodology, engineers realized the impor-tance of material toughness in avoiding brittle fracture. In 1901, a French scientist named G. Charpydeveloped a pendulum test that measured the energy of separation in notched metallic specimens.This energy was believed to be indicative of the resistance of the material to brittle fracture.FIGURE 7.39 Fracture toughness master curve.

Fracture Toughness Testing of Metals 341
An investigation of the Liberty ship failures during World War II revealed that fracture was much
more likely in steels with Charpy energy less than 20  J (15 ft-lb).
During the 1950s, when Irwin and his colleagues at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)
were formulating the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, a metallurgist at NRL namedW.S. Pellini developed the drop weight test, a qualitative measure of crack-arrest toughness.
Both the Charpy test and the Pellini drop weight test are still widely applied today to structural
materials. ASTM has standardized the drop weight tests, as well as a number of related approaches,including the Izod, drop weight tear and dynamic tear tests [42–45] (see Section 7.9.1). Althoughthese tests lack the mathematical rigor and predictive capabilities of fracture mechanics methods,these approaches provide a qualitative indication of material toughness. The advantage of thesequalitative methods is that they are cheaper and easier to perform than fracture mechanics tests.These tests are suitable for material screening and quality control, but are not reliable indicatorsof structural integrity.
7.9.1 C HARPY  AND IZOD IMPACT  TEST
The ASTM Standard E 23 [42] covers Charpy and Izod testing. These tests both involve impactinga small notched bar with a pendulum and measuring the fracture energy. The Charpy specimen is asimple notched beam that is impacted in three-point bending, while the Izod specimen is a cantileverbeam that is ﬁxed at one end and impacted at the other. Figure 7.40 illustrates both types of tests.
Charpy and Izod specimens are relatively small, and thus do not consume much material. The
standard cross section of both specimens is 10 mm × 10 mm, and the lengths are 55 and 75 mm
for Charpy and Izod specimens, respectively.
The pendulum device provides a simple but elegant method for quantifying the fracture energy.
As Figure 7.41 illustrates, the pendulum is released from a height y
1 and swings through the specimen
to a height y2. Assuming negligible friction and aerodynamic drag, the energy absorbed by the
specimen is equal to the height difference times the weight of the pendulum. A simple mechanicaldevice on the Charpy machine converts the height difference to a direct read-out of absorbed energy.

342 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
A number of investigators [46–52] have attempted to correlate Charpy energy to fracture
toughness parameters such as KIc. Some of these empirical correlations seem to work reasonably
well, but most correlations are often unreliable. There are several important differences between
the Charpy test and fracture mechanics tests that preclude simple relationships between the qual-itative and quantitative measures of toughness. The Charpy test contains a blunt notch, while fracturemechanics specimens have sharp fatigue cracks. The Charpy specimen is subsize, and thus has lowconstraint. In addition, the Charpy specimen experiences impact loading, while most fracturetoughness tests are conducted under quasistatic conditions.
It is possible to obtain quantitative information from fatigue precracked Charpy specimens,
provided the tup (i.e., the striker) is instrumented [53,54]. Such an experiment is essentially aminiature dynamic fracture toughness test.
7.9.2 D ROP WEIGHT TEST
The ASTM standard E 208 [43] outlines the procedure for performing the Pellini drop weight test.A plate specimen with a starter notch in a brittle weld bead is impacted in three-point bending. Acleavage crack initiates in the weld bead and runs into the parent metal. If the material is sufﬁcientlytough, the crack arrests, otherwise the specimen fractures completely.
Figure 7.42 illustrates the drop weight specimen and the testing ﬁxture. The crosshead drops
onto the specimen, causing it to deﬂect a predetermined amount. The ﬁxture is designed with adeﬂection stop, which limits the displacement in the specimen. A crack initiates at the starter notchand either propagates or arrests, depending on the temperature and material properties. A ‘‘break’’result is recorded when the running crack reaches at least one specimen edge. A ‘‘no-break’’ resultis recorded if the crack arrests in the parent metal. Figure 7.43 gives examples of break and no-break results.
A nil-ductility transition temperature (NDTT) is obtained by performing drop weight tests over
a range of temperatures, in 5 °C or 10°F increments. When a no-break result is recorded, the
temperature is decreased for the next test; the test temperature is increased when a specimen fails.When break and no-break results are obtained at adjoining temperatures, a second test is performedat the no-break temperature. If this specimen fails, a test is performed at one temperature increment(5°C or 10°F) higher. The process is repeated until two no-break results are obtained at oneFIGURE 7.41 A pendulum device for impact testing. The energy absorbed by the specimen is equal to the
weight of the crosshead, times the difference in height before and after impact.

temperature. The NDTT is deﬁned as 5 °C or 10°F below the lowest temperature where two no-
breaks are recorded.
The nil-ductility transition temperature gives a qualitative estimate of the ability of a material
to arrest a running crack. Arrest in structures is more likely to occur if the service temperature is
above NDTT, but structures above NDTT are not immune to brittle fracture.
The ship building industry in the U.S. currently uses the drop weight test to qualify steels
for ship hulls. The nuclear power industry relies primarily on quantitative fracture mechanicsmethodology, but uses the NDTT to index fracture toughness data for different heats of steel.FIGURE 7.42 Apparatus for drop weight testing according to ASTM E 208-87. Taken from E 208-95a,

7.9.3 D ROP WEIGHT TEAR AND DYNAMIC  TEAR TESTS
Drop weight tear and dynamic tear tests are similar to the Charpy test, except that the former are
performed on large specimens. The ASTM standards E 604 [45] and E 436 [44] cover drop weighttear and dynamic tear tests, respectively. Both test methods utilize three-point bend specimens thatare impacted in a drop tower or pendulum machine.
Drop weight tear specimens are 41 mm (1.6 in.) wide, 16 mm (0.625 in.) thick, and are loaded
over a span of 165 mm (6.5 in.). These specimens contain a sharp-machined notch. A 0.13-mm(0.010 in.)-deep indentation is made at the tip of this notch. The fracture energy is measured inthis test, much like the Charpy and Izod tests. Since drop weight specimens are signiﬁcantly largerthan Charpy specimens, the fracture energy is much greater, and the capacity of the testing machinemust be scaled accordingly. If a pendulum machine is used, the energy can be determined in thesame manner as in the Charpy and Izod tests. A drop test must be instrumented, however, becauseonly a portion of the potential energy is absorbed by the specimen; the remainder is transmittedthrough the foundation of the drop tower.
The dynamic tear test quantiﬁes the toughness of steel through the appearance of the fracture
surface. In the ductile-brittle transition region, a dynamic test produces a mixture of cleavagefracture and microvoid coalescence; the relative amount of each depends on the test temperature.The percent ‘‘shear’’ on the fracture surface is reported in dynamic tear tests, where the so-calledshear fracture is actually microvoid coalescence (Chapter 5). Dynamic tear specimens are 76 mm(3 in.) wide, 305 mm (12 in.) long, and are loaded over a span of 254 mm (10 in.). The specimenthickness is equal to the thickness of the plate under consideration. The notch is pressed into thespecimen by indentation.

where P is the applied load and f(a/w) is a dimensionless geometry function. The specimen dimen-
sions, B, W, and a  are deﬁned in Figure A7.1. The exception to the above form is the edge-cracked
plate in pure bending (Figure A7.1h), which is written in terms of the applied bending moment.
Table A7.2 lists solutions for the load-line compliance for some of the conﬁgurations in Figure A7.1.
Note that the load-line displacement has two components:
(A7.2)
where ∆nc is the load-line displacement in the absence of a crack and ∆c is the additional displace-
ment due to the presence of the crack. For the compact specimen, ∆nc = 0 because the load-line
displacement is measured at the crack mouth. 
Table A7.3 provides polynomial expressions that enable crack length to be inferred from
compliance measurements for compact and bend specimens. Expressions such as these are necessaryfor resistance curve measurement by means of the unloading compliance method (Figure 7.25).
Table A7.4 lists limit load solutions for several specimen types. These expressions are necessary
for determining the required load capacity of the test machine when measuring fracture toughnessin elastic-plastic regime.Kp

Fracture Testing of Nonmetals 
The procedures for fracture toughness testing of metals, which are described in Chapter 7, are fairly
well established. Fracture testing of plastics, composites, and ceramics is relatively new, however,and there are a number of unresolved issues.
Although many aspects of fracture toughness testing are similar for metals and nonmetals, there
are several important differences. In some cases, metals fracture testing technology is inadequate ontheoretical grounds. For example, the mechanical behavior of plastics can be highly rate dependent,and composites often violate continuum assumptions (see Chapter 6). There are also more pragmaticdifferences between fracture testing of metals and nonmetals. Ceramics, for instance, are typicallyvery hard and brittle, which makes specimen fabrication and testing more difﬁcult.
This chapter brieﬂy summarizes the current procedures for measuring the fracture toughness
in plastics, ﬁber-reinforced composites, and ceramics. The reader should be familiar with thematerial in Chapter 7, since much of the same methodology (e.g., specimen design, instrumentation,and fracture parameters) is currently being applied to nonmetals. 
8.1 FRACTURE TOUGHNESS MEASUREMENTS
IN ENGINEERING PLASTICS 
Engineers and researchers who have attempted to measure the fracture toughness of plastics haverelied almost exclusively on metals testing technology. Existing experimental approaches implicitlyrecognize the potential for time-dependent deformation, but do not speciﬁcally address viscoelasticbehavior in most instances. Schapery’s viscoelastic  
J 
 integral [1,2], which was introduced in
Chapter 4, has not seen widespread application to laboratory testing.
The Mode I stress-intensity factor  
K 
I 
 and the conventional  
J  
integral were originally developed
for time-independent materials, but may also be suitable for viscoelastic materials in certain cases.The restrictions on these parameters are explored below, followed by a summary of procedures for 
K  
and 
 J  
testing on plastics. Section 8.1.5 brieﬂy outlines possible approaches for taking account
of viscoelastic behavior and time-dependent yielding in fracture toughness measurements.

 an alternate parameter

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Let us examine the basis for applying 
 K  
and 
 J  
to viscoelastic materials, as well as the limitations
on these parameters. 
8.1.1.1 
K 
-Controlled Fracture 
In linear viscoelastic materials, remote loads and local stresses obey the same relationships as in
the linear elastic case. Consequently, the stresses near the crack tip exhibit a  singularity:
(8.1)
and  
K 
I 
 is related to remote loads and geometry through the conventional linear elastic fracture
mechanics (LEFM) equations introduced in Chapter 2. The strains and displacements depend onthe viscoelastic properties, however. Therefore, the critical stress-intensity factor for a viscoelasticmaterial can be rate dependent; a  
K 
Ic 
 value from a laboratory specimen is transferable to a structure
only if the local crack-tip strain histories of the two conﬁgurations are similar. Equation (8.1)applies only when yielding and nonlinear viscoelasticity are conﬁned to a small region surroundingthe crack tip.
Under plane strain linear viscoelastic conditions,  
K 
I 
 is related to the viscoelastic  
J 
 integral  
J 
v 
,
as follows [1]:
(8.2)
where  
E 
R 
 is a reference modulus, which is sometimes deﬁned as the short-time relaxation modulus.

 Linear viscoelastic material surrounds
a Dugdale strip-yield zone, which is small compared to specimen dimensions. Consider a point

which is at the leading edge of the yield zone at

Solving for  
ρ 
c 
 and inserting the result in Equation (8.8) gives
(8.9)
Therefore, according to this analysis, the fracture toughness is proportional to  and the crack
velocity varies as . Several investigators have derived relationships similar to Equation (8.9),including Marshall et al. [8] and Schapery [9].

 for various

 values. In a time-independent
material,

 0; the crack remains stationary below  
K

 and becomes unstable when  
K

. In such
materials,  
K

 is a unique material property. Most metals and ceramics are nearly time independent
at ambient temperature. When  
n

K

 values. If,
however, 
 n  
is small, the crack velocity is highly sensitive to stress intensity, and the  
-K 
I 
 curve
exhibits a sharp knee. For example, if 
 n  
= 
 0.1, the crack velocity is proportional to  In typical

Consider a short-time  
K 
Ic 
 test on a material with 
 n  
≤ 
 0.1, where  
K 
I 
 increases monotonically
until the specimen fails. At low  
K 
I 
 values (i.e., in the early portion of the test), the crack growth
would be negligible. The crack velocity would accelerate rapidly when the specimen reached theknee in the 
-K 
I 
 curve. The specimen would then fail at a critical  
K 
Ic 
 that would be relatively
insensitive to rate. Thus, if the knee in the crack velocity–stress intensity curve is sufﬁciently sharp,a short-time  
K 
Ic 
 test can provide a meaningful material property.
One must be careful in applying a  
K 
Ic 
 value to a polymer structure, however. While a statically
loaded structure made from a time-independent material will not fail as long as  
K 
I < KIc, slow crack
growth below KIc does occur in viscoelastic materials. Recall from Chapter 1 the example of the
polyethylene pipe that failed by time-dependent crack growth over a period of several years. Thepower-law form of Equation (8.9) enables long-time behavior to be inferred from short-time tests,as Example 8.1 illustrates.
Equation (8.9) assumes that the critical CTOD for crack extension is rate independent,
which is a reasonable assumption for materials that are well below T
g. For materials near Tg,
where E is highly sensitive to temperature and rate, the critical CTOD often exhibits a rate
dependence [3].FIGURE 8.2 Effect of applied KI on crack velocity for a variety of material responses.

EXAMPLE 8.1
Short-time fracture toughness tests on a polymer specimen indicate a crack velocity of 10 mm/sec at
KIc = 5 MPa . If a pipe made from this material contains a ﬂaw such that KI = 2.5 MPa ,
estimate the crack velocity, assuming  n = 0.08.

8.1.1.2 J-Contr olled Fracture
Schapery [1,2] has introduced a viscoelastic  J integral Jv that takes into account various types of
linear and nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. For any material that obeys the assumed constitutive
law, Schapery showed that Jv uniquely deﬁnes the crack-tip conditions (Section 4.3.2). Thus, Jv is
a suitable fracture criterion for a wide range of time-dependent materials. Most practical applicationsof fracture mechanics to polymers, however, have considered only the conventional  J integral,
which does not account for time-dependent deformation.
Conventional  J tests on polymers can provide useful information, but is important to recognize
the limitations of such an approach. One way to assess the signiﬁcance of critical  J data for polymers
is by evaluating the relationship between  J and J
v. The following exercise considers a constant rate
fracture test on a viscoelastic material.
Recall from Chapter 4 that strains and displacements in viscoelastic materials can be related to
pseudo-elastic quantities through hereditary integrals. For example, the pseudo-elastic displacement∆
e is given by
(8.10)
where ∆ is the actual load-line displacement and τ is an integration variable. Equation (8.10) stems
from the correspondence principle, and applies to linear viscoelastic materials for which Poisson’sratio is constant. This approach also applies to a wide range of nonlinear  viscoelastic material
behavior, although E(t) and E
R have somewhat different interpretations in the latter case.
For a constant displacement rate fracture test, Equation (8.10) simpliﬁes to
(8.11)
where  is the displacement rate and is a time-average modulus, deﬁned by
(8.12)
Figure 8.3 schematically illustrates load-displacement and load pseudo-displacement curves
for constant rate tests on viscoelastic materials. For a linear viscoelastic material (Figure 8.3(a)),the P-∆
e curve is linear, while the P-∆ curve is nonlinear due to time dependence. Evaluation of
pseudo strains and displacements effectively removes the time dependence. When ∆e is evaluatedm m

for a nonlinear viscoelastic material (Figure 8.3(b)), the material nonlinearity can be decoupled
from the time-dependent nonlinearity.
The viscoelastic J integral can be deﬁned from the load-pseudo-displacement curve:
(8.13)
where P is the applied load in a specimen of unit thickness. Assume that the P-∆e curve obeys a
power law:
(8.14)
where M and N are time-independent parameters; N is a material property, while M depends on
both the material and geometry. For a linear viscoelastic material, N = 1, and M is the elastic
stiffness. Inserting Equation (8.14) into Equation (8.13) leads to

Solving for Jv in terms of physical displacement (Equation (8.11)) gives
(8.16)
Let us now evaluate  J from the same constant rate test:
(8.17)
The load can be expressed as a function of physical displacement by combining Equation (8.11)
and Equation (8.14):
(8.18)
Substituting Equation (8.18) into Equation (8.17) leads to
(8.19)
since  Therefore
(8.20)
where
(8.21)
Thus J and Jv are related through a dimensionless function of time in the case of a constant rate
test. For a linear viscoelastic material in plane strain, the relationship between  J and KI is given by
(8.22)
The conventional  J integral uniquely characterizes the crack-tip conditions in a viscoelastic
material for a given time . A critical  J value from a laboratory test is transferable to a structure,
provided the failure times in the two conﬁgurations are the same.
A constant rate  J test apparently provides a rational measure of fracture toughness in polymers,
but applying such data to structural components may be problematic. Many structures are staticallyloaded at either a ﬁxed load or remote displacement. Thus a constant load creep test or a loadrelaxation test on a cracked specimen might be more indicative of structural conditions than aconstant displacement rate test. It is unlikely that the  J integral would uniquely characterize
viscoelastic crack-growth behavior under all loading conditions. For example, in the case of viscousJNEt

creep in metals, plots of  J vs. da/dt fail to exhibit a single trend, but C* (which is a special case
of Jv) correlates crack-growth data under different loading conditions (see Chapter 4).
The application of fracture mechanics to polymers presents additional problems for which both
J and Jv may be inadequate. At sufﬁciently high stresses, polymeric materials typically experience
irreversible deformation, such as yielding, microcracking, and microcrazing. This nonlinear material
behavior exhibits a different time dependence than viscoelastic deformation; computing pseudostrains and displacements may not account for rate effects in such cases.
In certain instances, the  J integral may be approximately applicable to polymers that exhibit
large-scale yielding. Suppose that there exists a quantity J
y that accounts for time-dependent yielding
in polymers. A conventional  J test will reﬂect the material fracture behavior if  J and Jy are related
through a separable function of time [10]:
(8.23)
Section 8.1.5 outlines a procedure for determining Jy experimentally.
In metals, the  J integral ceases to provide a single-parameter description of crack-tip conditions
when the yielding is excessive. Critical  J values become geometry dependent when the single-
parameter assumption is no longer valid (see Chapter 3). A similar situation undoubtedly exists inpolymers: the single-parameter assumption becomes invalid after sufﬁcient irreversible deformation.Neither  J nor J
y will give geometry-independent measures of fracture toughness in such cases.
Specimen size requirements for a single-parameter description of fracture behavior in polymershave yet to be established, although there has been some research in this area (see Section 8.1.3and Section 8.1.4).
Crack growth presents further complications when the plastic zone is large. Material near the
crack tip experiences nonproportional loading and unloading when the crack grows, and the  J
integral is no longer path independent. The appropriate deﬁnition of  J for a growing crack is unclear
in metals (Section 3.4.2), and the problem is complicated further when the material is rate sensitive.The rate dependence of unloading in polymers is often different from that of loading.
In summary, the  J integral can provide a rational measure of toughness for viscoelastic materials,
but the applicability of  J data to structural components is suspect. When the specimen experiences
signiﬁcant time-dependent yielding prior to fracture,  J may give a reasonable characterization of
fracture initiation from a stationary crack, as long as the extent of yielding does not invalidate thesingle-parameter assumption. Crack growth in conjunction with time-dependent yielding is aformidable problem that requires further study.
8.1.2 P RECRACKING  AND OTHER PRACTICAL  MATTERS
As with metals, fracture toughness tests on polymers require that the initial crack be sharp.Precracks in plastic specimens can be introduced by a number of methods, including fatigue andrazor notching.
Fatigue precracking in polymers can be very time consuming. The loading frequency must be
kept low in order to minimize hysteresis heating, which can introduce residual stresses at the crack tip.
Because polymers are soft relative to metals, plastic fracture toughness specimens can be
precracked by pressing a razor blade into a machined notch. Razor notching can produce a sharpcrack in a fraction of the time required to grow a fatigue crack, and the measured toughness is notadversely affected if the notching is done properly [4].
Two types of razor notching are common: razor-notch guillotine and razor sawing. In the former
case, the razor blade is simply pressed into the material by a compressive force, while razor sawingentails a lateral slicing motion in conjunction with the compressive force. Figure 8.4(a) andFigure 8.4(b) are photographs of ﬁxtures for the razor-notch guillotine and razor-sawing procedures,respectively.JJ tyy=φ()1656_C008.fm  Page 360  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:59 PM
Fracture Testing of Nonmetals 361
In order to minimize material damage and residual stresses that result from razor notching,
Cayard [4] recommends a three-step procedure: (1) fabrication of a conventional machined notch,
(2) extension of the notch with a narrow slitting saw, and (3) ﬁnal sharpening with a razor bladeby either of the techniques described above. Cayard found that such an approach produced verysharp cracks with minimal residual stresses. The notch-tip radius is typically much smaller thanthe radius of the razor blade, apparently because a small pop-in propagates ahead of the razor notch.
While the relative softness of plastics aids the precracking process, it can cause problems during
testing. The crack-opening force that a clip gage applies to a specimen (Figure 7.8) is negligibleFIGURE 8.4 Razor notching of polymer specimens: (a) razor-notched guillotine, and (b) razor sawing.

for metal specimens, but this load can be signiﬁcant in plastic specimens. The conventional cantilever
clip gage design may be too stiff for soft polymer specimens; a ring-shaped gage may be moresuitable.
One may choose to infer the specimen displacement from the crosshead displacement. In such
cases it is necessary to correct for extraneous displacements due to the indentation of the specimen bythe test ﬁxture. A displacement calibration can be inferred from a load-displacement curve for anunnotched specimen. If the calibration curve is linear, the correction to displacement is relatively simple:
(8.24)
where ∆
tot is the measured displacement and Ci is the compliance due to indentation. Since the
deformation of the specimen is time dependent, the crosshead rate in the calibration experimentshould match that in the actual fracture toughness tests.
8.1.3Klc TESTING
The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has published a number of standards forfracture testing of metals, which Chapter 7 describes. Committee D20 within ASTM developed astandard method for K
Ic testing of plastics [10]. This standard was based on a protocol developed
by the European Structural Integrity Society (ESIS), which in turn was based on the ASTM KIc
standard for metals, E 399 [12].
The ASTM KIc standard for plastics is very similar to E 399. Both test methods deﬁne an
apparent crack initiation load PQ by a 5% secant construction (Figure 7.13). This load must be
greater than 1.1 times the maximum load in the test for the result to be valid. The provisional fracturetoughness K
Q must meet the following specimen size requirements:
(8.25a)
(8.25b)
where 
B = specimen thickness
a = crack length
W = specimen width, as deﬁned in Figure 7.1
The yield strength σYS is deﬁned in a somewhat different manner for plastics. Figure 8.5

yields, it often experiences strain softening followed by strain hardening. The yield strength is
deﬁned at the peak stress prior to strain softening, as Figure 8.5 illustrates. Because the ﬂowproperties are rate dependent, the ASTM K
Ic standard for plastics requires that the time to reach
σYS in a tensile test coincide with the time to failure in the fracture test to within ±20%.
The size requirements for metals (Equation (8.25)) have been incorporated into the ASTM KIc
standard for plastics, apparently without assessing the suitability of these criteria for polymers.Recall from Chapter 2 and Chapter 7 the purported reasons for the K
Ic size requirements:
• The plastic zone should be small compared to in-plane dimensions to ensure the presence
of an elastic singularity zone ahead of the crack tip.
• The plastic zone (supposedly) should be small compared to the thickness to ensure
predominantly plane strain conditions at the crack tip.
In recent years, the second requirement has been called into question. As discussed in Section 2.10,the apparent thickness dependence of fracture toughness in metals is a result of the mixture of twofracture morphologies: ﬂat fracture and shear fracture. Moreover, plane strain conditions can existnear the crack tip even in the fully plastic regime; the plastic zone need not be small r elative to
thickness to ensure high triaxiality near the cr ack tip .
Section 7.2.2 discusses the shortcomings of the ASTM E 399 test procedure and validity require-
ments when applied to metals. Many of these issues also apply to polymer testing. For example, the5% secant method often introduces an artiﬁcial size dependence in K
Q, as described below.
Figure 8.6 shows the effect of specimen width on KQ values for a rigid polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) and a polycarbonate (PC) [4]. In most cases, the specimens were geometrically similar, withW = 2B and a /W = 0.5. For specimen widths greater that 50 mm in the PC, the thickness was ﬁxed
at 25 mm, which corresponds to the plate thickness. The size dependence in K
Q is a direct result
of inferring PQ from a 5% secant construction (Figure 7.13). 
As discussed in Section 7.2, nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve can come from two
sources: stable crack growth and crack-tip yielding (or crazing). In the former case, a 5% deviationfrom linearity corresponds to the crack growth through approximately 2% of the specimen ligament.For materials that exhibit a rising crack-growth resistance curve, the 2% crack growth criterionresults in a size-dependent K
Q, as Figure 7.17 illustrates. For materials that fracture without prior
stable crack growth, nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve is largely due to yielding or crazingat the crack tip. In such cases, 5% nonlinearity corresponds to the point at which the crack-tipplastic zone (or damage zone) is on the order of a few percent of the specimen ligament. Themeasured K
Q is proportional to  until the specimen size is sufﬁcient for fracture to occur
before a 5% nonlinearity is achieved.
In the case of PVC and PC (Figure 8.6), the nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve is
likely due to crack-tip yielding or crazing. Note that KQ is more size dependent in the PC than
in the PVC. The ASTM E 399 size requirements for in-plane dimensions appear to be adequatefor the latter but not for the former when K
Q is deﬁned by a 5% secant construction. The different
behavior for the two polymer systems can be partially attributed to strain-softening effects.Figure 8.7 shows the stress-strain curves for these two materials. Note that the PC exhibitssigniﬁcant strain softening, while the rigid PVC stress-strain curve is relatively ﬂat after yielding.Strain softening probably increases the size of the yielded zone. If one deﬁnes 
σYS as the lower
ﬂow stress plateau, the size requirements are more restrictive for materials that strain soften.Figure 8.6(b) shows the E 399 in-plane requirements corresponding to the lower yield strength;in the polycarbonate. Even with this adjustment, however, the E 399 methodology is not sufﬁcientto ensure a size-independent fracture toughness estimate in the PC. That is not to say that thefracture toughness is actually more sensitive to the specimen size in the PC. Rather, the realproblem is that the 5% secant construction introduces an artiﬁcial size dependence in the toughnessestimate K

Figures 8.8(a) and 8.8(b) are plots of fracture toughness vs. thickness for the PVC and the PC,
respectively [4]. Although all of the experimental data for the PVC are below the required thickness
(according to Equation (8.25)), these data do not exhibit a thickness dependence; Figure 8.8(a)indicates that the E 399 thickness requirement is too severe for this material. In the case of the PC,most of the data are above the E399 thickness requirement. These data also do not exhibit a thicknessFIGURE 8.6 Effect of specimen width on KQ in two engineering plastics: (a) rigid PVC and (b) polycarbonate.

dependence, which implies that the E 399 requirement is at least adequate for this material.
Further testing of thinner sections would be required to determine if the E 399 thickness requirementis overly conservative for the PC.
The apparent lack of a signiﬁcant thickness effect on the fracture toughness in PVC and PC is
broadly consistent with the observed behavior in metals. Recall from Section 2.10 and Section 7.2that the apparent thickness effect on fracture toughness is due primarily to shear lip formation inmaterials that fail by ductile crack growth. When a metal fails by cleavage, the fracture surface isusually ﬂat (no shear lips), and the fracture toughness is much less sensitive to the specimenthickness. The PVC and PC specimens failed in a relatively brittle manner, and shear lips were notevident on the fracture surface. Consequently, one would not expect a signiﬁcant thickness effect.
One ﬁnal observation regarding the ASTM K
Ic standard for plastics is that the procedure for
estimating PQ ignores time effects. Recall from the earlier discussion that nonlinearity in the load-
displacement curve in KIc tests can come from two sources: yielding and crack growth. In the case
of polymers, viscoelasticity can also contribute to nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve.Consequently, at least a portion of the 5% deviation from linearity at P
Q could result from a decrease
in the modulus during the test.
For most practical situations, however, viscoelastic effects are probably negligible during KIc tests.
In order to obtain a valid KIc result in most polymers, the test temperature must be well below Tg, where
rate effects are minimal at short times. The duration of a typical KIc test is on the order of several minutes,
and the elastic properties probably will not change signiﬁcantly prior to fracture.  The rate sensitivity
should be quantiﬁed, however, to evaluate the assumption that E does not change during the test.
8.1.4J TESTING
A number of researchers have applied  J integral test methods to polymers [3–6] over the last couple
of decades. More recently, ASTM has published a standard for J-R curve testing of plastics [13].
In addition, the European Structural Integrity Society (ESIS) has developed a protocol for J testing
of plastics [7]. Both J test methods are based on standards that were developed for metals such as
ASTM E 1820 [14].FIGURE 8.7 Stress-strain curves for the rigid PVC and polycarbonate. Taken from Cayard, M., “Fracture Tough-
ness Testing of Polymeric Materials.” Ph.D. Dissertation, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 1990.

For common test specimens such as the compact and bend geometries,  J is typically inferred
from the area under the load vs. load-line displacement curve:

Note that the J estimate in Equation (8.26) is not corrected for crack growth, nor is J separated
into elastic and plastic components as it is in ASTM E 1820.
The most common approach for inferring the J-R curve for a polymer is the multiple specimen
method. A set of nominally identical specimens are loaded to various displacements, and then
unloaded. The initial crack length and stable crack growth are measured optically from each specimen,resulting in a series of data points on a J-∆a plot. Determining the initial crack length a
o is relatively
easy, but inferring the precise position of the ﬁnal crack front in a given specimen is difﬁcult. Severaltechniques have been employed, including:
• Cooling the specimen and fracturing at either normal loading rates or at high impact rates
• Fracturing the specimen by impact loading at ambient temperature• Fatigue cycling after the test• Injecting ink onto the notch to mark the crack front
• Slicing the specimen into several sections and optically measuring the crack depth in
each section while it is under load
Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. When breaking open the specimen, whether atnormal or high loading rates, it is often difﬁcult to discern the difference between crack propagationduring the test and posttest fracture. In some polymers, cooling in liquid nitrogen or fracturing athigh loading rates produces thumbnail-shaped features on the fracture surface, which lead tosigniﬁcant overestimates of stable crack growth. Fatigue postcracking can be an effective meansto identify stable crack growth during the test, but it can also be time consuming. Sectioning isalso time consuming.
Single specimen techniques, such as unloading compliance, may also be applied to the measurement
of J
Ic and the J-R curve. Time-dependent material behavior can complicate unloading compliance
measurements, however. Figure 8.9 schematically illustrates the unload-reload behavior of a viscoelasticmaterial. If rate effects are signiﬁcant during the time frame of the unload-reload, the resulting curvecan exhibit a hysteresis effect. One possible approach to account for viscoelasticity in such cases is torelate instantaneous crack length to pseudo elastic displacements (see Section 8.1.5).
Critical  J values for polymers exhibit less size dependence than K
Q values. Figure 8.10 compares
KQ values for the polycarbonate (Figure 8.6) with KJc values, which were obtained by converting
critical  J values at fracture to an equivalent critical  K through the following relationship:
(8.27)
As discussed in Section 8.1.3 above, the 5% secant construction method leads to KQ values that
scale with  when nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve is due to yielding or crazingat the crack tip. However, when the specimen size is sufﬁcient that fracture occurs with negligible

nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve, KJc = KQ = KIc. Note that the KJc values are independent
of specimen size over the range of available data, despite material nonlinearity in the smaller specimens. 
Crack-growth resistance curves can be highly rate dependent. Figure 8.11 shows J-R curves
for a polyethylene pipe material that was tested at three crosshead rates [3]. Increasing the crosshead
rate from 0.254 to 1.27 mm/min (0.01 and 0.05 in./min, respectively) results in nearly a threefoldincrease in J
Ic in this case.FIGURE 8.10 Size dependence of KQ and J -based fracture toughness for PC. Taken from Cayard, M., “Fracture

8.1.5 E XPERIMENTAL  ESTIMATES  OF TIME-DEPENDENT  FRACTURE  PARAMETERS
While JIc values and J-R curves may be indicative of a polymer’s relative toughness, the existence
of a unique correlation between  J and the crack-growth rate is unlikely. Parameters such as Jv may
be more suitable for some viscoelastic materials. For polymers that experience large-scale yielding,
neither  J nor Jv may characterize crack growth.
This section outlines a few suggestions for inferring crack-tip parameters that take into account
the time-dependent deformation of engineering plastics. Since most of these approaches have yetto be validated experimentally, much of what follows contains an element of conjecture. Theseproposed methods, however, are certainly no worse than conventional  J integral approaches, and
may be considerably better for many engineering plastics.
The viscoelastic  J integral J
v can be inferred by converting physical displacements to pseudo
displacements. For a constant rate test, Equation (8.11) gives the relationship between ∆ and ∆e.
The viscoelastic  J integral is given by Equation (8.13); Jv can also be evaluated directly from the
area under the P-∆e curve:
(8.28)
for a specimen with unit thickness. If the load-pseudo displacement is a power law (Equation (8.18)),Equation (8.28) becomes
(8.29)
Comparing Equation (8.29) and Equation (8.15) leads to
(8.30)
Since M does not depend on time, the dimensionless 
η factor is the same for both  J and Jv.
Computing pseudo-elastic displacements might also remove hysteresis effects in unloading
compliance tests. If the unload-reload behavior is linear viscoelastic, the P-∆e unloading curves
would be linear, and the crack length could be correlated to the pseudo-elastic compliance .
Determining pseudo displacements from Equation (8.11) or the more general expression
(Equation (8.10)) requires a knowledge of E(t). A separate experiment to infer E(t) would not be
particularly difﬁcult, but such data would not be relevant if the material experienced large-scaleyielding in a fracture test. An alternative approach to inferring crack-tip parameters that takes timeeffects into account is outlined below.
Schapery [10] has suggested evaluating a J-like parameter from isochronous (ﬁxed time) load-
displacement curves. Consider a series of fracture tests that are performed over a range of crossheadrates (Figure 8.12(a)). If one selects a ﬁxed time and determines the various combinations of loadand displacement that correspond to this time, the resulting locus of points forms an isochronousload-displacement curve (Figure 8.12(b)). Since the viscoelastic and yield properties are timedependent, the isochronous curve represents the load-displacement behavior for ﬁxed materialproperties, as if time stood still while the test was performed. A ﬁxed-time J integral can be deﬁned
as follows:

370 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Suppose that the displacements at a given load are related by a separable function of time, such
that it is possible to relate all the displacements (at that particular load) to a reference displacement:
(8.32)
The isochronous load-displacement curves could then be collapsed onto a single trend bymultiplying each curve by 
γ(t), as Figure 8.12(c) illustrates. It would also be possible to deﬁne
a reference J:

The viscoelastic J is a special case of JR. For a constant rate test, comparing Equation (8.11)
and Equation (8.32) gives
(8.34)
Thus, for a linear viscoelastic material in plane strain,
(8.35)
Isochronous load-displacement curves would be linear for a linear viscoelastic material, since the
modulus is constant at a ﬁxed time.
The parameter  JR is more general than Jv; the former may account for time dependence in cases
where extensive yielding occurs in the specimen. The reference  J should characterize crack initiation
and growth in materials where Equation (8.33) removes the time dependence of displacement.Figure 8.13 schematically illustrates the postulated relationship between J
t, JR, and crack velocity.
The Jt− curves should be parallel on a log-log plot, while a JR− plot should yield a unique
curve.  Even if it is not possible to produce a single JR− curve for a material, the Jt parameter
should still characterize fracture at a ﬁxed time.
Although JR may characterize fracture initiation and the early stages of crack growth in a
material that exhibits signiﬁcant time-dependent yielding, this parameter would probably not becapable of characterizing extensive crack growth, since unloading and nonproportional loadingoccur near the growing crack tip. (See Section 8.1.1.)
8.1.6 Q UALITATIVE  FRACTURE  TESTS ON PLASTICS
The ASTM standard D 256 [15] describes impact testing of notched polymer specimens. This testmethod is currently the most common technique for characterizing the toughness of engineeringplastics. Over the years, impact testing has been performed on both Charpy and Izod specimens(Figure 7.36), but D 256 covers only the Izod specimen.
The procedure for impact testing of plastics is very similar to the metals approach, which is
outlined in ASTM E 23 [16] (see Section 7.9). A pendulum strikes a notched specimen, and theFIGURE 8.13 Postulated crack-growth behavior in terms of Jt and JR.

372 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
energy required to fracture the specimen is inferred from the initial and ﬁnal heights of the pendulum
(Figure 7.37). In the case of the Izod test, the specimen is a simple cantilever beam that is restrainedat one end and struck by the pendulum at the other. One difference between the metals and plasticstest methods is that the absorbed energy is normalized by the net ligament area in plastics tests,while tests according to ASTM E 23 report only the total energy. The normalized fracture energyin plastics is known as the impact strength .
The impact test for plastics is pervasive throughout the plastics industry because it is a simple
and inexpensive measurement. Its most common application is as a material-screening criterion.The value of impact strength measurements is questionable, however.
One problem with this test method is that the specimens contain blunt notches. Figure 8.14
[17] shows the Izod impact strength values for several polymers as a function of notch radius. Asone might expect, the fracture energy decreases as the notch becomes sharper. The slope of thelines in Figure 8.14 is a measure of the notch sensitivity  of the material. Some materials are highly
notch sensitive, while others are relatively insensitive to the radius of the notch. Note that therelative ordering of the materials’ impact strengths in Figure 8.14 changes with notch acuity. Thusa fracture energy for a particular notch radius may not be an appropriate criterion for rankingmaterial toughness. Moreover, the notch strength is often not a reliable indicator of how the materialwill behave when it contains a sharp crack.
Since Izod and Charpy tests are performed under impact loading, the resulting fracture energy
values are governed by the short-time material response. Many polymer structures, however, areloaded quasistatically and must be resistant to slow, stable crack growth. The ability of a materialto resist crack growth at long times is not necessarily related to the fracture energy of a blunt-notched specimen in impact loading.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) speciﬁcation for unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-U)
pipe, BS 3505 [18], contains a procedure for fracture toughness testing. Although the toughnesstest in BS 3506 is primarily a qualitative screening criterion, it is much more relevant to structuralperformance than the Izod impact test.
Appendices C and D of BS 3506 outline a procedure for inferring the toughness of a PVC-U
pipe after exposure to an aggressive environment. A C-shaped section is removed from the pipe ofinterest and is submerged in dichloromethane liquid. After 15 min of exposure, the specimen isremoved from the liquid and the surface is inspected for bleaching or whitening. A sharp notch isplaced on the inner surface of the specimen, which is then dead-loaded for 15 min or until crackingFIGURE 8.14 Effect of notch radius on the Izod

or total fracture is observed. Figure 8.15 is a schematic drawing of the testing apparatus. The
loading is such that the notch region is subject to a bending moment. If the specimen cracks orfails completely during the test, the fracture toughness of the material can be computed from theapplied load and notch depth by means of standard K
I formulas. If no cracking is observed during
the 15-min test, the toughness can be quantiﬁed by testing additional specimens at higher loads.The BS 3506 standard includes a semiempirical size correction for small pipes and high toughnessmaterials that do not behave in an elastic manner.
8.2 INTERLAMIN AR TOUGHNESS OF COMPOSITES
Chapter 6 outlined some of the difﬁculties in applying fracture mechanics to ﬁber-reinforcedcomposites. The continuum assumption is often inappropriate, and cracks may not grow in a self-similar manner. The lack of a rigorous framework to describe fracture in composites has led to anumber of qualitative approaches to characterize toughness.
Interlaminar fracture is one of the few instances where fracture mechanics formalism is appli-
cable to ﬁber-reinforced composites on a global scale. A zone of delamination can be treated as acrack; the resistance of the material to the propagation of this crack is the fracture toughness. Sincethe crack typically is conﬁned to the matrix material between plies, the continuum theory isapplicable, and the crack growth is self similar.
A number of researchers have performed delamination experiments on ﬁber-reinforced com-
posites over the past several decades [19–22]. Several standardized test methods for measuringinterlaminar fracture toughness have been published recently. For example, ASTM D 5528 addressesMode I delamination testing [23].
Figure 8.16 illustrates three common specimen conﬁgurations for interlaminar fracture toughness
measurements. The double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen is probably the most common conﬁgurationFIGURE 8.15 Loading apparatus for evaluating the toughness of a PVC-U pipe according to BS 3506. Taken

for this type of test. One advantage of this specimen geometry is that it permits measurements of Mode
I, Mode II, or mixed mode fracture toughness. The end-notched ﬂexure (ENF) specimen has essentiallythe same geometry as the DCB specimen, but the latter is loaded in three-point bending, which imposesMode II displacements of the crack faces. The edge delamination specimen simulates the conditions inan actual structure. Recall from Chapter 6 that tensile stresses normal to the ply are highest at the freeedge (Figure 6.16); thus delamination zones often initiate at the edges of a panel.
The initial ﬂaw in a DCB specimen is normally introduced by placing a thin ﬁlm (e.g., aluminum
foil) between plies prior to molding. The ﬁlm should be coated with a release agent so that it canbe removed prior to testing.FIGURE 8.16 Common conﬁgurations for evaluating interlaminar fracture toughness: (a) double cantilever

Figure 8.17 illustrates two common ﬁxtures that facilitate loading the DCB specimen. The
blocks or hinges are normally adhesively bonded to the specimen. These ﬁxtures must allow the
free rotation of the specimen ends with a minimum of stiffening.
The DCB specimen can be tested in Mode I, Mode II, or mixed-mode conditions, as Figure 8.18
illustrates. Recall from Chapter 2 that the energy release rate of this specimen conﬁguration canbe inferred from the beam theory.
For pure Mode I loading (Figure 8.18(a)), elastic beam theory leads to the following expression

can be resolved into Mode I and Mode II components as follows:
(8.39a)

where PU and PL are the upper and lower loads, respectively. The components of G can be computed
by inserting PI and PII into Equation (8.36) and Equation (8.38). Recall from Chapter 2 that Mode I
and Mode II components of energy release rate are additive.
Linear beam theory may result in erroneous estimates of energy release rate, particularly when the
specimen displacements are large. The area method [21, 22] provides an alternative measure of energy
release rate. Figure 8.19 schematically illustrates a typical load-displacement curve, where the specimenis periodically unloaded. The loading portion of the curve is typically nonlinear, but the unloadingcurve is usually linear and passes through the origin. The energy release rate can be estimated fromthe incremental area inside the load-displacement curve, divided by the change in crack area:
(8.40)
The Mode I and Mode II components of G can be inferred from the P
I-∆I and PII-∆II curves,
respectively. The corresponding loads and displacements for Mode I and Mode II are deﬁned inFigure 8.18 and Equation (8.39).
Figure 8.20 illustrates a typical delamination resistance curve for Mode I. After initiation and
a small amount of growth, delamination occurs at a steady-state G
Ic value, provided the global
behavior of the specimen is elastic.FIGURE 8.19 Schematic load-displacement curve for a delamination toughness measurement.

8.3 CERAMICS
Fracture toughness is usually the limiting property in ceramic materials. Ceramics tend to have
excellent creep properties and wear resistance, but are excluded from many load-bearing applica-tions because they are relatively brittle. The latest generation of ceramics have enhanced toughness(Section 6.2), but brittle fracture is still a primary area of concern in these materials.
Because toughness is a crucial property for ceramic materials, rational fracture toughness mea-
surements are absolutely essential. Unfortunately, fracture toughness tests on ceramics can be verydifﬁcult and expensive. Specimen fabrication, for example, requires special grinding tools, sinceordinary machining tools are inadequate. Precracking by fatigue is extremely time consuming; someinvestigators have reported precracking times in excess of one week per specimen [24]. During testing,it is difﬁcult to achieve stable crack growth with most specimen conﬁgurations and testing machines.
Several test methods have been developed to overcome some of the difﬁculties associated with
fracture toughness measurements in ceramics. The chevron-notched specimen [25–28] eliminatesthe need for precracking, while the bridge indentation approach [24, 29–33] is a novel method forintroducing a crack without resorting to a lengthy fatigue-precracking process. 
8.3.1 C HEVRON-NOTCHED  SPECIMENS
A chevron notch has a V-shaped ligament, such that the notch depth varies through the thickness,with the minimum notch depth at the center. Figure 8.21 shows two common conﬁgurations ofchevron-notched specimens: the short bar and the short rod. In addition, single-edge-notched bend(SENB) and compact specimens (Figure 7.1) are sometimes fabricated with chevron notches. Thechevron notch is often utilized in conventional fracture toughness tests on metals because this shapefacilitates the initiation of the fatigue precrack. For fracture toughness tests on brittle materials,the unique properties of the chevron notch can eliminate the need for precracking altogether.
Figure 8.22 schematically compares the stress-intensity factor vs. the crack length for chevron
and straight notch conﬁgurations. When the crack length = a
o, the stress-intensity factor in the
chevron-notched specimen is very high, because a ﬁnite load is applied over a very small netthickness.  When a 
≥ a1, the KI the values for the two notch conﬁgurations are identical, since the
chevron notch no longer has an effect. The KI for the chevron-notched specimen exhibits a minimum
at a particular crack length am, which is between ao and a1.

Fracture Testing of Nonmetals 379
The KI vs. crack length behavior of the chevron-notched specimen makes this specimen particu-
larly suitable for measuring the toughness in brittle materials. Consider a material in which the R
curve reaches a steady-state plateau soon after the crack initiates (Figure 8.23). The crack should
initiate at the tip of the chevron upon application of a small load, since the local KI is high. The crack
is stable at this point, because the driving force decreases rapidly with crack advance; thus additionalload is required to grow the crack further. The maximum load in the test, P
M, is achieved when the
crack grows to am, the crack length corresponding to the minimum in the KI-a curve. At this point,
the specimen will be unstable if the test is conducted in load control, but stable crack growth may bepossible beyond a
m if the specimen is subject to crosshead control. The point of instability in the
latter case depends on the compliance of the testing machine, as discussed in Section 2.5.FIGURE 8.22 Comparison of stress-intensity factors in specimens with chevron and straight notches. Note
that KI exhibits a minimum in the chevron-notched specimens.
FIGURE 8.23 Fracture toughness testing of a material with a ﬂat R curve. The maximum load in the test
occurs when a = am.
1656_C008.fm  Page 379  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:59 PM
380 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Since ﬁnal instability occurs at am, and am is known a priori  (from the KI vs. crack length
relationship), it is necessary only to measure the maximum load in this test. The fracture toughness
is given by
(8.41)
where KIvM is the chevron-notched toughness deﬁned at maximum load, and f(a/W) is the geometry
correction factor. Early researchers developed simple models to estimate f(a/W) for chevron-notched
specimens, but more recent (and more accurate) estimates are based on three-dimensional ﬁniteelement and boundary element analysis of this conﬁguration [27].
The maximum load technique for inferring toughness does not work as well when the material
exhibits a rising R curve, as Figure 8.24 schematically illustrates. The point of tangency between
the driving force and the  R curve may not occur at a
m in this case, resulting in an error in the stress-
intensity calculation. Moreover, the value of KR at the point of tangency is geometry dependent
when the R curve is rising.
If both load and crack length are measured throughout the test, it is possible to construct the
R curve for the material under consideration. Optical observation of the growing crack is not usuallyfeasible for a chevron-notched specimen, but the crack length can be inferred through an unloadingcompliance technique [22], in which the specimen is periodically unloaded and the crack lengthis computed from the elastic compliance.
Two ASTM standards for chevron-notched specimens are currently available. The ﬁrst such
standard developed for this specimen geometry, E 1304 [25], applies to brittle metals such as highstrength aluminum alloys. A more recent test method, ASTM C 1421 [25], addresses fracture tough-ness measurement in advanced ceramics.

The chevron-notched specimen has proved to be very useful in characterizing the toughness
of brittle materials. The advantages of this test specimen include its compact geometry, the simpleinstrumentation requirements (in the case of the K
IvM measurement), and the fact that no precracking
is required. One of the disadvantages of this specimen is its complicated design, which leads tohigher machining costs. Also, this specimen is poorly suited to high-temperature testing, and theK
IvM measurement is inappropriate for material with rising R curves.
8.3.2 B END SPECIMENS  PRECRACKED  BY BRIDGE  INDENTATION
A novel technique for precracking ceramic bend specimens has recently been developed in Japan[29]. A number of researchers [24, 29–33] have adopted this method, which has been incorporatedinto an ASTM standard for fracture toughness testing of ceramics, C 1421 [25]. Warren et al. [30],FIGURE 8.24 Application of the chevron-notched
specimen to a material with a rising R curve.
3 ASTM C 1421 covers both the chevron-notched test specimen and the edge-cracked bend specimen. The latter is precracked
using the bridge indentation method described in Section 8.3.2.

who were among the ﬁrst to apply this precracking technique, have termed it the “bridge indenta-
tion” method.
Figure 8.25 is a schematic drawing of the loading ﬁxtures for the bridge indentation method
of precracking. A starter notch is introduced into a bend specimen by means of a Vickers hardnessindentation. The specimen is compressed between two anvils, as Figure 8.25 illustrates. The topanvil is ﬂat, while the bottom anvil has a gap in the center. This arrangement induces a local tensilestress in the specimen, which leads to a pop-in fracture. The fracture arrests because the propagatingcrack experiences a falling  K ﬁeld.
The bridge indentation technique is capable of producing highly uniform crack fronts in bend
specimens. After precracking, these specimens can be tested in three- or four-point bending withconventional ﬁxtures. Nose and Fujii [24] showed that fracture toughness values obtained from bridge-precracked specimens compared favorably with data from conventional fatigue-precracked specimens.
Bar-On et al. [31] investigated the effect of precracking variables on the size of the crack that
is produced by this technique. Figure 8.26 shows that the length of the pop-in in alumina decreaseswith increasing Vickers indentation load. Also note that the pop-in load decreases with increasingindentation load. Large Vickers indentation loads produce signiﬁcant initial ﬂaws and tensileresidual stresses, which enable the pop-in to initiate at a lower load; the crack arrests sooner atlower loads because there is less elastic energy available for crack propagation. Thus, it is possibleto control the length of the precrack though the Vickers indentation load.
The bridge indentation technique is obviously much more economical than the fatigue pre-
cracking of ceramic specimens. The edge-cracked bend conﬁguration is simple, and therefore lessexpensive to fabricate. Also, three- and four-point bend ﬁxtures are suitable for high-temperaturetesting. One problem with the bend specimen is that it consumes more material than the chevron-notched specimens illustrated in Figure 8.21. This is a major shortcoming when evaluating newmaterials, where only small samples are available. Another disadvantage of the beam conﬁgurationis that it tends to be unstable; most test machines are too compliant to achieve stable crack growthin brittle bend specimens [32, 33].FIGURE 8.25 The bridge indentation method for precracking.

Application to Structures 
Recall Figure 1.7 in Chapter 1, which illustrates the so-called fracture mechanics triangle. When
designing a structure against fracture, there are three critical variables that must be considered:stress, ﬂaw size, and toughness. Fracture mechanics provides mathematical relationships betweenthese quantities. Figure 9.1 is an alternative representation of the three key variables of fracturemechanics. The stress and ﬂaw size provide the  
driving force 
 for fracture, and the fracture toughness
is a measure of the material’s  
resistance 
 to crack propagation. Fracture occurs when the driving
force reaches or exceeds the material resistance. Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 describe experimentalmethods to measure fracture toughness in metals and nonmetals, respectively. This chapter focuseson approaches for computing the fracture driving force in structural components that contain cracks.
Several parameters are available for characterizing the fracture driving force. In Chapter 2, the
stress-intensity factor  
K 
 and the energy release rate  
G 
 were introduced. These parameters are suitable
when the material is predominately elastic. The  
J 
 integral and crack-tip-opening displacement
(CTOD) are appropriate driving force parameters in the elastic-plastic regime. Recall fromChapter 3 that the  
J 
 integral is a generalized formulation of the energy release rate; in the limit of
linear elastic material behavior,  
J 
  
= 
  
G 
.
Techniques for computing fracture driving force range from very simple to complex. The most
appropriate methodology for a given situation depends on geometry, loading, and material proper-ties. For example, a three-dimensional ﬁnite element analysis (Chapter 12) may be necessary whenboth the geometry and loading are sufﬁciently complicated that a simple hand calculation will notsufﬁce. When signiﬁcant yielding precedes fracture, an analysis based on linear elastic fracturemechanics (LEFM) may not be suitable.

This chapter focuses on fracture initiation and instability in structures made from linear elastic
and elastic-plastic materials. A number of engineering approaches are discussed; the basis of theseapproaches and their limitations are explored. This chapter covers only quasistatic methodologies,but such approaches can be applied to rapid loading and crack arrest in certain circumstances (seeChapter 4). The analyses presented in this chapter do not address time-dependent crack growth.Chapter 10 and Chapter 11 consider fatigue crack growth and environmental cracking, respectively. 
9.1LINEAR ELASTIC FRACTURE MECHANICS 
Analyses based on LEFM apply to structures where crack-tip plasticity is small. Chapter 2 intro-duced many of the fundamental concepts of LEFM. The fracture behavior of a linear elastic structurecan be inferred by comparing the applied 
 K  
(the driving force) to a critical 
 K  
or a  
K-R  
curve (the
fracture toughness). The elastic energy release rate  
G 
 is an alternative measure of driving force,
and a critical value of  
G 
 quantiﬁes the material toughness.
For Mode I loading (Figure 2.14), the stress-intensity factor can be expressed in the following
form:
(9.1) 
1  
There are a number of simpliﬁed elastic-plastic analysis methods that use LEFM parameters such as  
K 
, combined with
an appropriate adjustment for plasticity. Two such methodologies are described in the present chapter: the reference stress
approach and the failure assessment diagram (FAD).9

If the geometry factor is known, the applied

The applied stress intensity can then be compared to the appropriate material property, which may
be a

 value, a  
K-R 
 curve, environment-assisted cracking data, or, in the case of cyclic loading,
fatigue crack growth data (see Chapter 10).
Fracture analysis of a linear elastic structure becomes relatively straightforward once a 
 K 
solution is obtained for the geometry of interest. Stress-intensity solutions can come from a numberof sources, including handbooks, the published literature, experiments, and numerical analysis.
A large number of stress-intensity solutions have been published over the past 50 years. Several
handbooks [1–3] contain compilations of solutions for a wide variety of conﬁgurations. The publishedliterature contains many more solutions. It is often possible to ﬁnd a 
 K  
solution for a geometry that
is similar to the structure of interest.
When a published 
 K  
solution is not available, or the accuracy of such a solution is in doubt, one
can obtain the solution experimentally or numerically. Deriving a closed-form solution is probablynot a viable alternative, since this is possible only with simple geometries and loading, and nearly allsuch solutions have already been published. Experimental measurement of 
 K  
is possible through
optical techniques, such as photoelasticity [4, 5] and the method of caustics [6], or by determining  
G 
from the rate of change in compliance with crack length (Equation (2.30)) and computing 
 K  
from  
G 
(Equation (2.58)). However, these experimental methods for determining fracture driving force param-eters have been rendered virtually obsolete by advances in computer technology. Today, nearly allnew  
K 
 solutions are obtained numerically. Chapter 12 describes a number of computational techniques
for deriving stress intensity and energy release rate.
An alternative to ﬁnite element analysis and other computational techniques is to utilize the
principle of elastic superposition, which enables new 
 K  
solutions to be constructed from known
cases. Section 2.6.4 outlined this approach, and demonstrated that the effect of a far-ﬁeld stress on 
K 
 can be represented by an appropriate crack-face pressure. Inﬂuence coefﬁcients [7], described
below, are an application of the superposition principle. Section 2.6.5 introduced the concept ofweight functions [8, 9], from which  
K 
 solutions can be obtained for arbitrary loading. Examples
of the application of the weight function approach are presented in Section 9.1.3.

Laboratory fracture toughness specimens usually contain idealized cracks, but naturally occurring
ﬂaws in structures are under no obligation to live up to these ideals. Structural ﬂaws are typicallyirregular in shape and are part-way through the section thickness. Moreover, severe stress gradientsoften arise in practical situations, while laboratory specimens experience relatively simple loading.
Newman and Raju [10] have published a series of  
K 
I 
 solutions for part-through cracks. Figure 9.2
illustrates the assumed geometries. Newman and Raju approximate buried cracks, surface cracks, andcorner cracks as ellipses, half ellipses, and quarter ellipses, respectively. These solutions apply tolinear stress distributions, where the stress normal to the ﬂaw can be resolved into bending andmembrane components, respectively (Figure 9.3). If the stress distribution is not perfectly linear, theequivalent membrane stress can be inferred from the integrated average stress through the thickness,while the equivalent bending stress can be inferred by computing a resultant moment (per unit width)and dividing by 6 
t

The Newman and Raju solutions for part-through ﬂaws subject to membrane and bending
stresses are expressed in the following form:

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
The Newman and Raju solutions apply to ﬂat plates, but provide a reasonable approximation
for cracks in curved shells as long as the radius of curvature  
R 
 is large relative to the shell thickness  
t 
.
Recently, Anderson et al. [11] published a comprehensive set of  
K 
 solutions for surface cracks in
cylindrical and spherical shells with a wide range of  
R 
/

 values.
Equation (9.2) is reasonably ﬂexible, since it can account for a range of stress gradients, and
includes pure membrane loading and pure bending as special cases. This equation, however, is
actually a special case of the inﬂuence coefﬁcient approach, which is described below.

That is, we have superimposed KI solutions for power-law loading with n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to obtain
the solution for the polynomial distribution. By comparing each term in the above expression with
Equation (9.6), we see that
Consider the example of a pressurized cylinder with an internal axial surface ﬂaw, as illustrated

becomes

where x is in the radial direction with the origin at Ri. The ﬁrst ﬁve terms of this expansion give
the desired fourth-order polynomial. An alternate approach would be to curve-ﬁt a polynomial toFIGURE 9.6 Internal and external axial surface ﬂaws in a pressurized cylinder.

the stress ﬁeld. This latter method is necessary when the stress distribution does not have a closed-
form solution, such as when nodal stresses from a ﬁnite element analysis are used.
When computing KI for the internal surface ﬂaw, we must also take account of the pressure
loading on the crack faces. Superimposing p on Equation (9.9), and applying Equation (9.7) to
each term in the series leads to the following expression for KI [7,12]:
(9.10)
Applying a similar approach to an external surface ﬂaw leads to
(9.11)
The origin in this case was deﬁned at the outer surface of the cylinder, and a series expansion wasperformed as before. Thus K
I for a surface ﬂaw in a pressurized cylinder can be obtained by
substituting the appropriate inﬂuence coefﬁcients into Equation (9.10) or Equation (9.11).
The inﬂuence coefﬁcient approach is useful for estimating KI values for cracks that emanate
from stress concentrations. Figure 9.7 schematically illustrates a surface crack at the toe of a ﬁlletweld. This geometry produces local stress gradients that affect the K
I for the crack. Performing a
ﬁnite element analysis of this structural detail with a crack is generally preferable, but the inﬂuencecoefﬁcient method can give a reasonable approximation. If the stress distribution at the weld toeis known for the uncracked case, these stresses can be ﬁt to a polynomial (Equation (9.6)), andK
I can be estimated by substituting the inﬂuence coefﬁcients and polynomial coefﬁcients into
Equation (9.7).
The methodology in the previous example is only approximate, however. If the inﬂuence
coefﬁcients were obtained from an analysis of a ﬂat plate, there may be slight errors if these Gn
values are applied to the ﬁllet weld geometry. The actual weld geometry has a relatively modesteffect on the G
n values. As long as the stress gradient emanating from the weld toe is taken into
account, computed KI values will usually be within 10% of values obtained from a more rigorous
analysis.

392 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Since the ﬂaw in Figure 9.7 is near a weld, there is a possibility that weld residual stresses will
be present. These stresses must be taken into account in order to obtain an accurate estimate of KI.
Weld residual stresses are discussed further in Section 9.1.4.
9.1.3 W EIGHT FUNCTIONS  FOR ARBITRARY  LOADING
While the inﬂuence coefﬁcient approach is useful, it has limitations. It requires that the stress
distribution be ﬁtted to a polynomial. There are many instances where a polynomial expression(fourth order or lower) does not provide a good representation of the actual stress ﬁeld. Forexample, the ﬁve-term Taylor series expansion of the hoop stress in a thick-wall pressure vessel(Equation (9.8) and Equation (9.9)) is not accurate for R
i/t < 4.
The weight function method, which was introduced in Chapter 2, provides a means to compute
stress-intensity solutions for arbitrary loading. Consider a surface crack of depth a, subject to a
normal stress that is an arbitrary function of x, where x is oriented in the crack depth direction and
is measured from the free surface.2 The Mode I stress-intensity factor is given by
(9.12)
where  is the weight function.
For the deepest point of a semielliptical crack ( f = 90°), the weight function can be represented
by an equation of the following form [13,14]:
(9.13)
where the coefﬁcients M1 to M3 depend on the geometry and crack dimensions. The corresponding
expression for the free surface ( f = 0°) is given by [13,14]
(9.14)
Each of these expressions contains three unspeciﬁed coefﬁcients. However, one unknown can
be eliminated by invoking boundary conditions on the weight function [13,14]. For the deepestpoint of the crack, imposing the condition that the second derivative of the weight function is zeroat x = 0 implies that M
2 = 3. Setting h0 = 0 at x = a results in the following relationship:
(9.15)
Therefore, the weight function coefﬁcients Mi and Ni can be inferred from reference KI solutions
for two load cases on the conﬁguration of interest. The choice of reference load cases is arbitrary,but it is convenient to use uniform and linear crack-face pressure ( n = 0 and n = 1, respectively).
The corresponding inﬂuence coefﬁcients for these load cases are G
0 and G1. Setting Equation (9.5)
2  Note that the present discussion is restricted to a one-dimensional normal stress distribution. That is, the pressure normal
to the crack face may vary over the depth of the ﬂaw, but it is constant along the ﬂaw length at a given x value. Equation
(2.53) describes the general case where the traction varies arbitrarily over the crack surface.Kh x a x d xIa

equal to Equation (9.12) for the two reference cases and assuming a unit value for pn results in
simultaneous integral equations:
(9.16a)
(9.16b)
Substituting Equation (9.13) and Equation (9.14) into the above expressions and applying the
aforementioned boundary conditions leads to expressions for Mi and Ni. At the deepest point of
the crack, the weight function coefﬁcients are given by
(9.17a)
(9.17b)
(9.17c)
where the inﬂuence coefﬁcients G0 and G1 are evaluated at f = 90°. The weight function coefﬁcients
at the free surface are as follows:
(9.18a)
(9.18b)
(9.18c)
where G0 and G1 are evaluated at f = 0°.
Once Mi and Ni have been determined for a given geometry and crack size, the stress
distribution for the problem of interest must be substituted into Equation (9.12). Numericalintegration is normally required, especially if s(x) is characterized by nodal stress results from
a ﬁnite element analysis. For some stress distributions, a closed-form integration of Equation(9.12) is possible. For example, closed-form solutions exist for power-law crack-face pressure(Equation (9.4)). Consequently, it is possible to solve for higher-order inﬂuence coefﬁcientsusing the weight function method.
At the deepest point of the crack ( f = 90°), the inﬂuence coefﬁcients for n = 2 to 4 are given by

394 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The corresponding inﬂuence coefﬁcients for the free surface ( f = 0°) are as follows:
(9.20a)
(9.20b)
(9.20c)
Therefore, if one wishes to apply the inﬂuence coefﬁcient approach, it is not necessary to
compute the higher-order Gn solutions with ﬁnite element analysis. If solutions for uniform and
linear crack-face loading are available, the weight function coefﬁcients can be computed from
Equation (9.17) and Equation (9.18). For more complex load cases, KI can be inferred by inte-
grating Equation (9.12). Alternatively, if the stress distribution can be represented by a polynomialexpression, the higher-order inﬂuence coefﬁcients can be computed from Equation (9.19) andEquation (9.20) and K
I can be inferred from Equation (9.7). The advantage of the latter approach
is that numerical integration is not required. Consequently, the inﬂuence coefﬁcient approach ismore conducive to spreadsheet calculations than the weight function method.
Equations (9.13)–(9.20) apply only to two locations on the crack front: f = 0° and f  = 90°.
Wang and Lambert [15] have developed a weight function expression that applies to the fullrange for semielliptical surface cracks. Anderson et al. [11] have integrated this expres-
sion to solve for the inﬂuence coefﬁcients ( G
i) at arbitrary crack front angles. The resulting equations
are rather lengthy, and consequently are omitted for the sake of brevity.
9.1.4 P RIMARY , SECONDARY , AND RESIDUAL  STRESSES
Section 2.4 introduced the concept of load control and displacement control, where a structure orspecimen is subject to applied forces or imposed displacements, respectively. The applied energyrelease rate, and therefore the stress intensity factor, is the same, irrespective of whether a givenstress distribution is the result of applied loads or imposed displacements. Section 2.5 andSection 3.4.1 discuss the relative stability of cracked components in load control and displacementcontrol. Crack growth tends to be unstable in load control but can be stable in displacement control.
There are very few practical situations in which a cracked body is subject to pure displacement
control. Figure 2.12, which is a simple representation of the more typical case, shows a crackedplate subject to a ﬁxed remote displacement ∆
t. The spring in series represents the system compli-
ance Cm. For example, a long cracked plate in which the ends are ﬁxed would have a large system
compliance. If Cm is large, there is essentially no difference between (remote) displacement control
and load control as far as the crack is concerned. See Section 9.3.3 for further discussion of theeffect of system compliance on crack stability.
Some design codes for structures such as pressure vessels and piping refer to load-controlled
stresses as primary  and displacement-controlled stresses as secondary . Hoop stress due to internal
pressure in a pipe or pressure vessel is an example of a primary stress because the pressureconstitutes applied forces on the boundary of the structure. Thermal expansion (or contraction)leads to imposed displacements, so thermal stresses are usually considered secondary. As long asthe total stress is well below the yield strength, the classiﬁcation of stresses as primary and secondaryis not important. When plastic deformation occurs, however, secondary stresses redistribute andmay relax from their initial values. For this reason, design codes that classify stresses as primaryand secondary usually permit higher allowable values of the latter.
A special case of a displacement-controlled stress is residual stress due to weld shrinkage. Weld
residual stresses are usually not taken into account in design because they do not affect the failureGQNNN21 2 34

stress of a ductile material in the absence of signiﬁcant crack-like ﬂaws. When a crack is present,
however, residual stresses do contribute to the fracture driving force and must be included in theanalysis.
In linear elastic analyses, primary, secondary, and residual stresses are treated in an identical
fashion. The total stress intensity is simply the sum of the primary and secondary components:
(9.21)
where the superscripts P, S, and R denote primary, secondary, and residual stress quantities,
respectively.
The distinction between primary and secondary stresses is important only in elastic-plastic and
fully plastic analyses. Section 9.2 and Section 9.4 describe the treatment of primary, secondary,and residual stresses in such cases.
9.1.5 A WARNING  ABOUT  LEFM
Performing a purely linear elastic fracture analysis and assuming that LEFM is valid is potentially
dangerous, because the analysis gives no warning when it becomes invalid. The user must rely onexperience to know whether or not plasticity effects need to be considered. A general rule of thumbis that plasticity becomes important at around 50% of the yield, but this is by no means a universal rule.
The safest approach is to adopt an analysis that spans the entire range from linear elastic to
fully plastic behavior. Such an analysis accounts for the two extremes of brittle fracture and plasticcollapse. At low stresses, the analysis reduces to LEFM, but predicts collapse if the stresses aresufﬁciently high. At intermediate stresses, the analysis automatically applies a plasticity correctionwhen necessary; the user does not have to decide whether or not such a correction is needed. Thefailure assessment diagram (FAD) approach, described in Section 9.4, is an example of a generalmethodology that spans the range from linear elastic to fully plastic material behavior.
9.2 THE CT OD DESIGN CUR VE
The CTOD concept was applied to structural steels beginning in the late 1960s. The British Welding
Research Association, now known as The Welding Institute (TWI), and other laboratories performedCTOD  tests on structural steels and welds. At that time there was no way to apply these results to
welded structures because  CTOD driving force equations did not exist. Burdekin and Stone [16]
developed the  CTOD equivalent of the strip-yield model in 1966. Although their model provides
a basis for a  CTOD driving force relationship, they were unable to modify the strip-yield model
to account for residual stresses and stress concentrations. (These difﬁculties were later overcomewhen a strip-yield approach became the basis of the R6 fracture analysis method, as discussed inSection 9.4).
In 1971, Burdekin and Dawes [17] developed the CTOD design curve, a semiempirical driving
force relationship, which was based on an idea that Wells [18] originally proposed. For linear elasticconditions, fracture mechanics theory was reasonably well developed, but the theoretical frameworkrequired to estimate the driving force under elastic-plastic and fully plastic conditions did not existuntil the late 1970s. Wells, however, suggested that global strain should scale linearly with  CTOD
under large-scale yielding conditions. Burdekin and Dawes based their elastic-plastic driving forcerelationship on Wells’ suggestion and an empirical correlation between small-scale  CTOD tests
and wide double-edge-notched tension panels made from the same material. The wide platespecimens were loaded to failure, and the failure strain and crack size of a given large-scale specimenwere correlated with the critical  CTOD in the corresponding small-scale test.KK K KItotal

396 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The correlation that resulted in the  CTOD design curve is illustrated schematically in Figure 9.8.
The critical  CTOD is nondimensionalized by the half crack length a of the wide plate and is shown
on the ordinate of the graph. The nondimensional  CTOD is plotted against the failure strain in the
wide plate, normalized by the elastic yield strain ey. Based on a plot similar to Figure 9.8, Burdekin
and Dawes [17,19] proposed the following two-part relationship:
(9.22a)
and
(9.22b)
Equation (9.22a), which was derived from LEFM theory, includes a safety factor of 2.0 on crack
size. Equation (9.22b) represents an upper envelope of the experimental data.
The applied strain and ﬂaw size in a structure, along with the critical  CTOD for the material,
can be plotted on Figure 9.8. If the point lies above the design curve, the structure is consideredsafe because all observed failures are below the design line. Equation (9.22a) and Equation (9.22b)conform to the classical view of a fracture mechanics analysis, in relating stress (or strain in thiscase) to fracture toughness ( d
crit) and ﬂaw size ( a). The CTOD design curve is conservative, however,
and does not relate critical  combinations of these variables.
In 1980, the  CTOD design curve approach was incorporated into the British Standards document
PD 6493 [20]. This document addresses ﬂaws of various shapes by relating them back to an equivalentFIGURE 9.8 The CTOD design curve.

through-thickness dimension . For example, if a structure contains a surface ﬂaw of length 2c
and depth a , the equivalent through-thickness ﬂaw produces the same stress intensity when loaded
to the same stress as the structure with the surface ﬂaw. Thus  is a generalized measure of a
ﬂaw’s severity. The  CTOD design curve can be applied to any ﬂaw by replacing a with  in
Equation (9.22).
The original CTOD design curve was based on correlations with ﬂat plates loaded in tension.
Real structures, however, often include complex shapes that result in stress concentrations. In addition,the structure may be subject to bending and residual stresses, as well as tensile (membrane) stresses.The PD 6493:1980 approach accounts for complex stress distributions simply and conservatively byestimating the maximum total strain in the cross section and assuming that this strain acts throughthe entire cross section. The maximum strain can be estimated from the following equation:
(9.23)
where
k
t = elastic stress concentration factor
Pm = primary membrane stress
Pb = primary bending stress
S = secondary stress
R = residual stresses
Since the precise distribution of residual stresses was usually unknown, R was typically assumed
to equal the yield strength in an as-welded weldment.
When Burdekin and Dawes developed the  CTOD design curve, the  CTOD and wide plate data
were limited; and the curve they constructed laid above all available data. In 1979, Kamath [21]reassessed the design curve approach with additional wide plate and  CTOD data generated between
1971 and 1979. In most cases, there were three  CTOD tests for a given condition. Kamath used the
lowest measured  CTOD value to predict failure in the corresponding wide plate specimen. When he
plotted the results in the form of Figure 9.8, a few data points fell above the design curve, indicatingEquation (9.22) was nonconservative in these instances. The  CTOD design curve, however, was
conservative in most cases. Kamath estimated the average safety factor on crack size to be 1.9, althoughindividual safety factors ranged from less than 1 to greater than 10. With this much scatter, the conceptof a safety factor is of little value. A much more meaningful quantity is the conﬁdence level. Kamathestimated that the  CTOD design curve method corresponds to a 97.5% conﬁdence of survival. That
is, the method in PD 6493:1980 is conservative, approximately 97.5% of the time.
The CTOD design curve and PD 6493:1980 have been superseded by procedures that are based
more on fundamental principles than empirical correlations. Two such approaches for elastic-plasticfracture mechanics analysis are direct evaluation of the J integral and the FAD approach. These
methodologies are described in Section 9.3 and Section 9.4, respectively.
9.3 ELASTIC-PLASTIC J-INTEGRAL ANALYSIS
The most rigorous method to compute J is to perform an elastic-plastic ﬁnite element analysis on
the structural component that contains a crack. Chapter 12 outlines techniques for incorporating acrack into a ﬁnite element mesh, and it describes the algorithms for computing the J integral from
ﬁnite element results. Some commercial ﬁnite element codes have built-in J-integral analysis
capabilities.
There are a number of simpliﬁed methods for estimating J in lieu of elastic-plastic ﬁnite element
analysis. Two such methods, the Electric Power Research Institute(EPRI) J estimation scheme and
the reference stress approach, are described in Section 9.3.1 and Section 9.3.2, respectively.a

398 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
For materials that fail by an unstable mechanism such as cleavage (Chapter 5), fracture analysis is
simply a matter of comparing the applied J to the critical J. In ductile materials, however, fracture
toughness is typically characterized by a resistance curve rather than a single J value. Section 9.3.3
describes ductile instability analysis, where the driving force is compared with a J resistance curve.
9.3.1 T HE EPRI J-ESTIMATION  PROCEDURE
The J integral was ﬁrst used as a fracture toughness parameter in the early 1970s. At that time,
there was no convenient way to compute the applied J in a structural component. Stress-intensity-
factor handbooks were available, but a corresponding handbook for elastic-plastic analysis did not
exist. Finite element analysis was a relatively new tool that was available only to a few specialists.
In the late 1970s, the EPRI decided to develop a series of J handbooks that would enable users
to estimate the fracture driving force under elastic-plastic conditions. Shih and Hutchinson [22]developed the basic methodology for cataloging J solutions in handbook form. A series of ﬁnite
element analyses were performed at General Electric Corporation in Schenectady, New York, andthe ﬁrst J handbook was an engineering handbook by EPRI in 1981 [23].
A few additional J handbook volumes were published subsequent to the original [24–26], but
this collection of J-integral solutions covers a very limited range of cases. Most of the solutions
are for simple two-dimensional geometries such as ﬂat plates with through cracks and edge cracks.Because of these limitations, the EPRI J handbooks are of little value for most real-world problems.
As a practical engineering tool, the ERPI J handbooks have not lived up to original expectations.
However, the research funded by EPRI in the late 70s and early 80s did contribute to our understandingof elastic-plastic fracture mechanics. The EPRI research had an inﬂuence on current methodologies.For example, the development of a J-based failure assessment diagram (Section 9.4.2) was largely
inspired by the EPRI J estimation approach. Given its historical signiﬁcance, it is appropriate to
include a description of the EPRI approach in this chapter. 
The EPRI procedure provides a means for estimating the applied  J integral under elastic-plastic
and fully plastic conditions. The elastic and plastic components of  J are computed separately and
added to obtain the total J:
(9.24)
The elastic J is actually the elastic energy release rate G, which can be computed from K
I using
Equation (2.54). Fully plastic J solutions were inferred from ﬁnite element analysis and were
tabulated in a dimensionless form, as described later in this chapter.
9.3.1.1 Theoretical Background
Consider a cracked structure with a fully plastic ligament, where elastic strains are negligible.
Assume that the material follows a power-law stress-strain curve:
(9.25)
which is the second term in the Ramberg-Osgood model (Equation (3.22)). The parameters a, n,
eo, and so are deﬁned in Section 3.2.3. Close to the crack tip, under J-controlled conditions, the
stresses are given by the HRR singularity:

Application to Structures 399
which is a restatement of Equation (3.24a). Solving for  J in the HRR equation gives
(9.27)
For J-controlled conditions, the loading must be proportional. That is, the local stresses must
increase in proportion to the remote load P. Therefore, Equation (9.27) can be written in terms of P:
(9.28)
where
h = dimensionless function of geometry and n
L = characteristic length dimension for the structure
Po = reference load
Both L and Po can be deﬁned arbitrarily, and h can be determined by numerical analysis of the
conﬁguration of interest.
It turns out that the assumptions of  J dominance at the crack tip and proportional loading are
not necessary to show that  J scales with Pn +1 for a power-law material, but these assumptions were
useful for deriving the correct form of the J-P relationship.
Equation (9.28) is an estimate of the fully plastic  J. Under linear elastic conditions,  J must
scale with P2. The EPRI J estimation procedure assumes that the total  J is equal to the sum of the
elastic and plastic components (Equation (9.24)).
9.3.1.2Estimation Equations
The fully plastic equations for J, crack-mouth-opening displacement Vp, and load line displacement
∆p have the following form for most geometries:
(9.29)
(9.30)(9.31)
where
b = uncracked ligament length
a = crack length
h
1, h2, and h3 = dimensionless parameters that depend on geometry and hardening exponent
The h factors for various geometries and n values, for both plane stress and plane strain, are tabulated
in several EPRI reports [23–26]. The appendix at the end of this chapter includes tables of h factors
for several simple conﬁgurations.
The reference load Po is usually deﬁned by a limit load solution for the geometry of interest;
Po normally corresponds to the load at which the net cross section yields.
Several conﬁgurations have  J expressions that are slightly different from Equation (9.29). For
example, the fully plastic  J integral for a center-cracked panel and a single-edge-notched tensionJI roo nij

(9.32)
where, in the case of the center-cracked panel, a is the half crack length and W is the half width.
This modiﬁcation was made in order to reduce the sensitivity of h1 to the crack length/width ratio.
The elastic  J is equal to G(aeff), the energy release rate for an effective crack length, which is
based on a modiﬁed Irwin plastic zone correction:
(9.33)
where b = 2 for plane stress and b = 6 for plane strain conditions. Equation (9.33) is a ﬁrst-order
correction, in which aeff is computed from the elastic KI, rather than Keff; thus iteration is not
necessary. This is an empirical adjustment that was applied in order to match the  J values from
the estimation procedure with corresponding values from rigorous elastic-plastic ﬁnite element
analysis. This correction has a relatively small effect on computed J values.
The CTOD can be estimated from a computed  J value as follows:
(9.34)
where dn is a dimensionless constant that depends on ﬂow properties [27]. Figure 3.18 shows plots
of dn for both plane stress and plane strain. Equation (9.34) must be regarded as approximate in
the elastic-plastic and fully plastic regimes, because the J-CTOD relationship is geometry dependent
in large-scale yielding.
EXAMPLE 9.1
Consider a single-edge-notched tensile panel with W = 1 m, B = 25 mm, and a = 125 mm. Calculate
J vs. applied load assuming plane stress conditions. Neglect the plastic zone correction.
Given: so = 414 MPa, n = 10, a = 1.0, E = 207,000 MPa, eo = so/E = 0.002
Solution : From Table A9.13, the reference load for this conﬁguration is given by`
where
Solving for Po gives

measurements because it relates  J to the area under the load vs. the load-line displacement curve.   FIGURE 9.9 Applied J vs. applied load in an edge-cracked panel (Figure 9.1).

402 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Since Equation (9.31) gives an expression for the P-∆p curve for a stationary crack, it is
possible to compare Jpl estimates from Equation (9.29) and Equation (9.32) with Equation (9.35).
According to Equation (9.31), the  P-∆p curve follows a power law, where the exponent is the
same as in the material’s true stress–true strain curve. The plastic energy absorbed by the specimen
is as follows:
(9.36)
Thus the plastic  J is given by
(9.37)
Comparing Equation (9.29) and Equation (9.37) and solving for hp gives
(9.38a)
Alternatively, if Jpl is given by Equation (9.34)
(9.38b)
Consider an edge-cracked bend specimen in plane strain. The EPRI fully plastic J solution for
this conﬁguration is tabulated in Table A9.8. The reference load, assuming unit thickness and thestandard span of 4 W, is given by
(9.39)
Substituting Equation (9.39) into Equation (9.38a) gives
(9.40)
Equation (9.40) is plotted in Figure 9.10 for n = 5 and n = 10. According to the equation that was
derived in Section 3.2.5, h
p = 2. This derivation, however, is valid only for deep cracks, since it
assumes that the ligament length b is the only relevant length dimension. Figure 9.10 indicates that
Equation (9.40) approaches the deep crack limit with increasing a/W. For n = 10, the deep crack
formula appears to be reasonably accurate beyond a/W~0.3. Note that the hp values computed from
Equation (9.40) for deep cracks ﬂuctuate about an average of ~1.9, rather than the theoretical valueof 2.0. The deviations from the theoretical value for deep cracks may be indicative of numericalerrors in the h
1 and h3 values. Pdn

Equation (3.32) was derived for a double-edge-notched tension panel, but also applies to a
deeply notched center-cracked panel. A comparison of Equation (9.32) with the second term of
Equation (3.32) leads to the following relationship for a center-cracked panel in plane stress:
(9.41)
where JEPRI is the plastic  J computed from Equation (9.32) and JDC is the plastic  J from the deep
crack formula. Figure 9.11 is a plot of Equation (9.41). The deep crack formula underestimates  J at
small a/W ratios, but coincides with JEPRI when a /W is sufﬁciently large. Note that the deep crack
formula applies to a wider range of a/W for n = 10. The deep crack formula assumes that all plasticity
is conﬁned to the ligament, a condition that is easier to achieve in low-hardening materials.
9.3.2 T HE REFERENCE  STRESS APPROACH
Prior to the publication of the EPRI J solutions, Ainsworth [28]3 developed a methodology to
estimate the C* parameter for creep crack growth, which is a J-like parameter that accounts forFIGURE 9.10 Comparison of the plastic h factor inferred from the EPRI handbook with the deep crack value
of 2.0 derived in Chapter 3.
3 The actual publication date of Ainsworth’s work on creep crack growth was 1982, which was after the ﬁrst EPRI handbook
had been published. However, Ainsworth actually began his work in the late 1970s, before tabulated fully plastic J solutions
were available.

time-dependent creep deformation (Chapter 4). He expressed the creep crack driving force C* as
a function of a parameter that he called reference stress . Several years later, Ainsworth [29]
combined the reference stress concept with the EPRI J estimation procedure to introduce a new
fracture assessment methodology that is more versatile than the original EPRI approach. 
The EPRI equations for fully plastic J, Equation (9.29) and Equation (9.32), assume that the
material’s stress-plastic strain curve follows a simple power law. Many materials, however, have ﬂow
behavior that deviates considerably from a power law. For example, most low carbon steels exhibita plateau in the ﬂow curve immediately after yielding. Applying Equation (9.29) or Equation (9.32)to such a material, results in signiﬁcant errors. Ainsworth [29] modiﬁed the EPRI relationships toreﬂect more closely the ﬂow behavior of real materials. He deﬁned a reference stress as follows:
(9.42)
He further deﬁned the reference strain as the total axial strain when the material is loaded to auniaxial stress of s
ref. Substituting these deﬁnitions into Equation (9.29) gives
(9.43)
For materials that obey a power law, Equation (9.43) agrees precisely with Equation (9.29), butthe former is more general, in that it is applicable to all types of stress-strain behavior.
Equation (9.43) still contains h
1, the geometry factor that depends on the power-law-hardening
exponent n. Ainsworth proposed redeﬁning Po for a given conﬁguration to produce another constant
h1′ that is insensitive to n. He noticed, however, that even without the modiﬁcation of Po, h1 was
relatively insensitive to n except at high n values (low-hardening materials). Ainsworth believed
that accurate estimates of h1 were less crucial for high n values because at that time, the strip-yield
failure assessment diagram (Section 9.4.1) was considered adequate for low-hardening materials.FIGURE 9.11 Comparison of J estimates from the EPRI handbook with the deep crack formula for a center-

He proposed the following approximation.
(9.44)
where h1(n) is the geometry constant for a material with a strain hardening exponent of n and h1(1)
is the corresponding constant for a linear material. By substituting h1(1) into Equation (9.29) or
Equation (9.32), Ainsworth was able to relate the plastic  J to the linear elastic stress-intensity factor:
(9.45)
where m = 0.75 for plane strain and m = 1.0 for plane stress. 
Ainsworth’s work has important ramiﬁcations. When applying the EPRI approach, one must
obtain a stress-intensity factor solution to compute the elastic J, and a separate solution for h1 in
order to compute the plastic term. The h1 constant is a plastic geometry correction factor. However,
Equation (9.45) makes it possible to estimate Jpl from an elastic geometry correction factor. The
original EPRI handbook [23] and subsequent additions [24–26] contain h1 solutions for a relatively
small number of conﬁgurations, but there are thousands of stress-intensity factor solutions in
handbooks and the literature. Thus Equation (9.45) is not only simpler than Equation (9.29), butalso more widely applicable.
Ainsworth made additional simpliﬁcations and modiﬁcations to the reference stress model in
order to express it in terms of a FAD. The expression for the FAD based on the reference stressconcept is given in Section 9.4.3.
9.3.3 D UCTILE  INSTABILITY  ANALYSIS
Section 3.4.1 outlined the theory of stability of  J-controlled crack growth. Crack growth is stable as
long as the rate of change in the driving force ( J) is less than or equal to the rate of change of the
material resistance ( JR). Equation (3.49) and Equation (3.50) deﬁned the tearing modulus, which is
a nondimensional representation of the derivatives of both the driving force and the resistance:
(9.46)
where ∆T is the remote displacement:
(9.47)
where CM is the system compliance (Figure 2.12). Recall that the value of CM inﬂuences the relative
stability of the structure; CM = ∞ corresponds to dead loading, which tends to be unstable, while
CM = 0 represents the other extreme of displacement control, which tends to be more stable. Crack
growth is unstable when
(9.48)
The rate of change in driving force at a ﬁxed remote displacement is given by4
(9.49)
4  The distinction between local and remote displacements ( ∆ and CM P, respectively) is arbitrary as long as all displacements
due to the crack are included in ∆. The local displacement ∆ can contain any portion of the “no crack” elastic displacements
without affecting the term in square brackets in Equation (9.49).hn h111 () ( )≈

406 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Methods for assessing structural stability include crack driving force diagrams and stability
assessment diagrams. The former is a plot of  J and JR vs. crack length, while a stability assessment
diagram is a plot of tearing modulus vs. J. These diagrams are merely alternative methods for
plotting the same information.
Figure 9.12 shows a schematic driving force diagram for both load control and displacement
control. In this example, the structure is unstable at P3 and ∆3 in load control, but the structure is
stable in displacement control. Figure 9.13 illustrates driving force curves for this same structure,
but with ﬁxed remote displacement ∆T and ﬁnite system compliance CM. The structure is unstable
at ∆T(4) in this case.FIGURE 9.12 Schematic driving force diagram for load control and displacement control.

Application to Structures 407
Figure 9.14 illustrates the load-displacement curve for this hypothetical structure. A maximum
load plateau occurs at P3 and ∆3, and the load decreases with further displacement. In load control,
the structure is unstable at P3, because the load cannot increase further. The structure is always
stable in pure displacement control ( CM = 0), but is unstable at ∆4 (and ∆T(4) = ∆4 + CM P4) for the
ﬁnite compliance case.
Figure 9.15 is a schematic stability assessment diagram. The applied and material tearing moduli
are plotted against  J and JR, respectively. Instability occurs when the Tapp-J curve crosses the  TR-JR curve.
The latter curve is relatively easy to obtain, since  JR depends only on the amount of crack growth:

408 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Thus, there is a unique relationship between TR and JR, and the TR-JR curve can be deﬁned
unambiguously. Suppose, for example, that the J-R curve is ﬁt to a power law:
(9.51)
The material tearing modulus is given by
(9.52)
The applied tearing modulus curve is less clearly deﬁned, however. There are a number of
approaches for deﬁning the Tapp-J curve, depending on the application. Figure 9.15 illustrates two
possible approaches, which are discussed next.
Suppose that the initial crack size ao is known, and one wishes to determine the loading
conditions (P , ∆, and ∆T) at failure. In this case, the Tapp should be computed at various points on
the R curve. Since  J = JR during stable crack growth, the applied  J at a given crack size can be
inferred from the J-R curve (Equation (9.50)). The remote displacement ∆T increases as the loading
progresses up the J-R curve (Figure 9.13); instability occurs at ∆T(4). The ﬁnal load, local displace-
ment, crack size, and stable crack extension can be readily computed, once the critical point on
the J-R curve has been identiﬁed.
The Tapp-J curve can also be constructed by ﬁxing one of the loading conditions ( P, ∆, or ∆T),
and determining the critical crack size at failure, as well as ao. For example, if we ﬁx ∆T at ∆T(4)
in the structure, we would predict the same failure point as the previous analysis but the Tapp-J
curve would follow a different path (Figure 9.15). If, however, we ﬁx the remote displacement ata different value, we would predict failure at another point on the T
R-JR curve; the critical crack
size, stable crack extension, and ao would be different from the previous example.
9.3.4 S OME PRACTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS
If the material is sufﬁciently tough or if crack-like ﬂaws in the structure are small, the structurewill not fail unless it is loaded into the fully plastic regime. When performing fracture analyses inthis regime, there are a number of important considerations that many practitioners overlook.
In the fully plastic regime, the  J integral varies with P
n+1 for a power-law material; a slight
increase in load leads to a large increase in the applied J. The J vs. the crack-length driving force
curves are also very steep in this regime. Consequently, the failure stress and critical crack size areinsensitive to toughness in the fully plastic regime; rather, failure is governed primarily by the ﬂowproperties of the material. The problem is reduced to a limit load situation, where the main effectof the crack is to reduce the net cross section of the structure.
Predicting the failure stress or critical crack size under fully plastic conditions need not be
complicated. A detailed tearing instability analysis and a simple limit load analysis should lead tosimilar estimates of failure conditions.
Problems arise, however, when one tries to compute the applied  J at a given load and crack
size. Since  J is very sensitive to load in the fully plastic regime, a slight error in P produces a
signiﬁcant error in the estimated J. For example, a 10% overestimate in the yield strength s
o will
produce a corresponding error in  Po, which will lead to an underestimate of  J by a factor of 3.2
for n = 10. Since ﬂow properties typically vary by several percent in different regions of a plate,
and heat-to-heat variations can be much larger, accurate estimates of the applied  J at a ﬁxed load
are extremely difﬁcult.
If estimates of the applied  J are required in the fully plastic regime, the displacement , not the
load, should characterize conditions in the structure. While the plastic  J is proportional to Pn+1, Jpl
scales with  according to Equation (9.29) and Equation (9.31). Thus a J-∆ plot is nearly linear
in the fully plastic regime, and displacement is a much more sensitive indicator of the appliedJC a aRoC=−12()

Recall Section 9.2, where the empirical correlation of  CTOD and wide plate data that resulted
in the CTOD design curve was plotted in terms of strain (i.e., displacement over a ﬁxed gage
length) rather than stress [17,19]. A correlation based on stress would not have worked, becausethe failure stresses in the wide plate specimens were clustered around the ﬂow stress of the material.(a)

9.4 F AILURE ASSESSMENT DIAGRAMS
The Failure Assessment Diagrams (FAD) is probably the most widely used methodology for elastic-
plastic fracture mechanics analysis of structural components. The original FAD was derived fromthe strip-yield plastic zone correction, as described in Section 9.4.1. The strip-yield model haslimitations, however. For example, it does not account for strain hardening. A more accurate FADcan be derived from an elastic-plastic J-integral solution (Section 9.4.2). In addition, there are
simpliﬁed versions of the FAD that account for strain hardening but do not require a rigorous J
integral solution (Section 9.4.3).
The FAD approach is easy to implement. A highly nonlinear problem (elastic-plastic fracture)
is solved in terms of two parameters that vary linearly with applied load.
The FAD approach is also very versatile. It spans a wide range of material behavior, from
brittle fracture under linear elastic conditions to ductile overload in the fully plastic regime. TheFAD method is appropriate for welded components because it can account for residual stresses(Section 9.4.5). The FAD can also be used for ductile tearing analysis (Section 9.4.7).
9.4.1 O RIGINAL  CONCEPT
Dowling and Townley [30] and Harrison et al. [31] introduced the concept of a two-criterion FADto describe the interaction between brittle fracture and fully ductile rupture. The ﬁrst FAD wasderived from a modiﬁed version of the strip-yield model, as described next.
The effective stress intensity factor for a through crack in an inﬁnite plate, according to the
strip-yield model, is given by 
(9.53)
As discussed in Chapter 2, this relationship is asymptotic to the yield strength. Equation (9.53) canbe modiﬁed for real structures by replacing s
YS with the collapse stress sc for the structure. This
would ensure that the strip-yield model predicts failure as the applied stress approaches the collapsestress. For a structure loaded in tension, collapse occurs when the stress on the net cross-sectionreaches the ﬂow stress of the material. Thus s
c depends on the tensile properties of the material
and the ﬂaw size relative to the total cross section of the structure. The next step in deriving afailure assessment diagram from the strip-yield model entails dividing the effective stress intensityby the linear elastic K:
(9.54)
This modiﬁcation not only expresses the driving force in a dimensionless form but also eliminatesthe square root term that contains the half-length of the through crack. Thus Equation (9.54) removesthe geometry dependence of the strip-yield model.
5 This is analogous to the PD 6493:1980 approach,
where the driving force relationship was generalized by deﬁning an equivalent through thicknessﬂaw . As a ﬁnal step, we can deﬁne the stress ratio S
r and the K ratio Kr as follows:
(9.55)
5 This generalization of the strip-yield model is not rigorously correct for all conﬁgurations, but it is a good approximation.Kaeff YS

The failure assessment diagram is then obtained by inserting the above deﬁnitions into Equation (9.54)
and taking the reciprocal:
(9.57)
Equation (9.57) is plotted in Figure 9.17. The curve represents the locus of predicted failure points.Fracture is predicted when K
eff = Kmat, where Kmat is the fracture toughness in terms of stress-
intensity units.6 If the toughness is very large, the structure fails by collapse when Sr = 1.0. A brittle
material will fail when Kr = 1.0. In intermediate cases, collapse and fracture interact, and both Kr
and Sr are less than 1.0 at failure. All points inside of the FAD are considered safe; points outside
of the diagram are unsafe.
In order to assess the signiﬁcance of a particular ﬂaw in a structure, one must determine the
toughness ratio as follows:

The stress ratio for the component of interest can be deﬁned as the ratio of the applied stress to
the collapse stress. Alternatively, the applied Sr can be deﬁned in terms of axial forces or moments.
If the assessment point with coordinates ( Sr, Kr) falls inside of the FAD curve, the analysis predicts
that the component is safe.
EXAMPLE 9.2
A middle tension (MT) panel (Figure 7.1(e)) 1 m wide and 25 mm thick with a 200 mm crack must
carry a 7.00 MN load. For the material Kmat = 200 MPa, sYS = 350 MPa, and sTS = 450 MPa. Use
the strip-yield FAD to determine whether or not this panel will fail.
Solution : We can take account of work hardening by assuming a ﬂow stress that is the average of yield
and tensile strength. Thus sﬂow = 400 MPa. The collapse load is then deﬁned when the stress on the
remaining cross section reaches 400 MPa:
Therefore
The applied stress intensity can be estimated from Equation (2.46) (without the polynomial term):
Thus
The point (0.875, 0.805) is plotted in Figure 9.17. Since this point falls outside of the failure assessment
diagram, the panel will fail before reaching 7 MN. Note that a collapse analysis or brittle fractureanalysis alone would have predicted a “safe” condition. The interaction of fracture and plastic collapse
causes failure in this case.
In 1976, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in Great Britain incorporated the
strip-yield failure assessment into a fracture analysis methodology, which became known as the
R6 approach [31]. There have been several revisions of the R6 procedure over the years. The R6approach is still based on the FAD methodology, but Equation (9.57) is no longer used. Section 9.4.2and Section 9.4.3 describe the modern formulation of the FAD approach.
9.4.2J-BASED FAD
Bloom [32] and Shih et al. [33] showed that a J-integral solution from the EPRI handbook could
be plotted in terms of a FAD. Of course, a more rigorous J solution based on elastic-plastic ﬁnite
element analysis can also be plotted as a FAD.
The failure assessment diagram is nothing more than an alternative method for plotting the
fracture driving force. The shape of the FAD curve is a function of plasticity effects. As describedabove, the ﬁrst FAD was derived from the strip-yield plastic zone correction, which assumes anonhardening material. A J solution merely provides a more accurate description of the FAD curve.m

Figure 9.18 is a schematic plot of the fracture driving force vs. the applied stress. The applied
J can be converted to an equivalent K through the following relationship:
(9.59)
In the linear elastic range, KJ = KI and stresses near the crack tip are characterized by a
singularity (Chapter 2). In the elastic-plastic range, the plot of KJ vs. stress deviates from linearity
and a stress singularity no longer exists. Note that KJ is a special case of Keff, the stress-
intensity factor adjusted for plasticity effects (Section 2.8). However, KJ has a sounder theoretical
basis than Keff values estimated from the Irwin plastic zone correction or the strip-yield model.
Following the approach of the original derivation of the FAD from the strip-yield model, let
us deﬁne a K ratio as follows:
(9.60)
Figure 9.19 is a schematic plot of Kr vs. applied stress. In the limit of small applied stresses, linear
elastic conditions prevail and Kr = 1. This ratio decreases as the applied stress increases.
Next, we normalize the horizontal axis by introducing a load ratio:
(9.61)
where sref is the reference stress, which was introduced in Section 9.3.2. Traditionally, the reference stress
has been based on yield load or limit load solutions for the conﬁguration of interest (Equation (9.42)).
However, this approach introduces geometry dependence into the FAD curve. Section 9.4.4 presentsan alternative deﬁnition of s
ref.
The ﬁnal step in creating the FAD is introducing a cut-off value Lr(max) on the horizontal axis.
This cutoff represents a limit load criterion.FIGURE 9.18 Schematic plot of crack driving force vs. applied stress.

414 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The FAD curve is a representation of the driving force. In order to assess the likelihood of
failure, we need to incorporate the fracture toughness into the analysis. This is accomplished by
plotting an assessment point on the FAD. The y coordinate of this point is deﬁned as follows:
(9.62)
where Kmat is the material’s fracture toughness in stress-intensity units. The x coordinate of the
assessment point is computed from Equation (9.61).
In most low- and medium-strength structural alloys, it is not practical to obtain a KIc value that
is valid according to the ASTM 399 procedure (Section 7.2). Consequently, fracture toughness isusually characterized by either J or CTOD. The conversions to K
mat for these two parameters are
as follows:
(9.63a)
or
(9.63b)
where χ is a constraint factor, which typically ranges from 1.5 to 2 for most geometries and
materials.
Figure 9.20 illustrates a hypothetical assessment point plotted on the FAD. If the assessment point
falls inside the FAD, the structure is considered safe. Failure is predicted when the point falls outsideof the FAD. The nature of the failure is a function of where the point falls. When both the toughnessand applied stress are low (small L
r and large Kr), the failure occurs in the linear elastic range and
usually is brittle. At the other extreme (large Lr and small Kr), the failure mechanism is ductile overload.
For cases that fall between these extremes, fracture is preceded by plastic deformation.FIGURE 9.19 Driving force curve from Figure 9.18, replotted in terms of Kr vs. applied stress.

Provided Lr < Lr(max), the failure criterion in the FAD method can be inferred from a comparison
of Equation (9.60) and Equation (9.62):
(9.64)
which is equivalent to
(9.65)
Therefore, there is no substantive difference between the FAD method and a conventional J analysis.
The only difference, which is purely cosmetic, is the way in which the driving force and material
resistance are presented graphically.
In the original formulation of the J-based FAD, the y axis was actually deﬁned as the square
root of the ratio of the elastic J to the total J. However, by applying Equation (9.59) to the numerator
and denominator of this ratio, it can easily be shown that such a formulation is identical toEquation (9.60):
(9.66)
The y axis of the FAD can also be expressed in terms of a CTOD ratio . This formulation is
also identical to Equation (9.62), provided the same constraint factor χ in the CTOD– K conversion
(Equation (9.63b)) is applied to both the numerator and denominator.
9.4.3 A PPROXIMATIONS  OF THE FAD C URVE
The most rigorous method to determine a FAD curve for a particular application is to perform anelastic-plastic J integral analysis and deﬁne K
r by Equation (9.60). Such an analysis can beFIGURE 9.20 Failure assessment diagram (FAD), which spans the range of fully brittle to fully ductile

complicated and time consuming, however. Simpliﬁed approximations of the FAD curve are
available. Two such approaches are outlined below.
In general, the shape of the FAD curve depends on material properties and geometry. However,
the geometry dependence can be virtually eliminated through a proper deﬁnition of Lr, as described
in Section 9.4.4. The following expression, which is based on the reference stress approachdescribed in Section 9.3.3, accounts for the material dependence in the FAD curve but assumesthat it is geometry independent [34]:
(9.67)
where L
r is given by Equation (9.60) and the reference strain eref is inferred from the true stress –
true strain curve at various sref values. The FAD curve obtained from Equation (9.67) reﬂects the
shape of the stress-strain curve. Therefore, Equation (9.67) predicts a FAD that is unique for eachmaterial.
When stress-strain data are not available for the material of interest, one of the following generic
FAD expressions may be used [34,35]:
(9.68a)
(9.68b)
Note that these expressions assume that the FAD is independent of both geometry and materialproperties. Equation (9.68a) was obtained from an empirical ﬁt of FAD curves generated withEquation (9.67) with a range of stress-strain curves [34]. This ﬁt was biased toward the lower boundof the family of FAD curves obtained with Equation (9.67). Equation (9.68b), which gives a FADcurve that is within 3% of Equation (9.68a), is a recent modiﬁcation that is intended to provide abetter ﬁt of Equation (9.67) at intermediate L
r values [35].
Figure 9.21 is a plot that compares Equation (9.67) and Equation (9.68). In the case of the
material-speciﬁc FAD (Equation (9.67)), the Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain curve was assumedwith three different hardening exponents. As strain-hardening increases (i.e., as n decreases),
there is a more gradual “tail” in the FAD curve. The FAD curves produced by Equation (9.68a)and Equation (9.68b) are very close to one another, although the new expression does indeedprovide better agreement with Equation (9.67) than the original expression. Note that thematerial dependence in the FAD curve manifests itself primarily in the fully plastic regime(L
r > 1). For Lr < 1, the difference between the various FAD curves plotted in Figure 9.21 is
minimal. Equation (9.68a) or Equation (9.68b) should be adequate for most practical applica-tions because design stresses are usually below yield. When performing a fracture analysis inthe fully plastic regime, the material-speciﬁc FAD (Equation (9.67)) or an elastic-plastic J
analysis should be used.
9.4.4 E STIMATING  THE REFERENCE  STRESS
Currently, most FAD approaches normalize the x axis by the limit load or yield load solution.
Unfortunately, this practice can lead to apparent geometry dependence in the FAD curve.Figure 9.22 shows an example of this phenomenon. The EPRI J handbook procedure, described
in Section 9.3.1, was used to generate FAD curves for various normalized crack lengths in a middleKE

tension (MT) specimen (Figure 7.1d). When the applied load is normalized by the yield load Po
on the x axis, the resulting FAD curves depend on the relative crack length.
Recently, an alternative approach for normalizing the x axis of the FAD was proposed [36].
Consider the material-speciﬁc FAD expression (Equation (9.67)). Setting Lr = 1 in this equation
and solving for the ratio of the total J to the elastic component leads to
(9.69)
where sYS is the 0.2% offset yield strength. An elastic-plastic J solution, obtained from ﬁnite element
analysis or the EPRI J handbook, can be normalized such that the above expression is satisﬁed at
Lr = 1. The reference stress, which is used to compute Lr (Equation (9.61)), is proportional to the
nominal applied stress:
(9.70)
where F is a geometry factor. The value of snominal  at which Equation (9.69) is satisﬁed can be
inferred from the elastic-plastic J solution. The geometry factor is given by
(9.71)
Figure 9.23 shows the FAD curves from Figure 9.22 normalized by the reference stress, as
deﬁned by the above procedure. The geometry dependence disappears when the x axis is deﬁned
by this procedure. This method forces all curves to pass through the same point at Lr = 1. Since
the curves have a nearly identical shape, they are in close agreement at other Lr values.
Figure 9.24 compares J-based FAD curves for two geometries with Equation (9.67), the
material-speciﬁc and geometry-independent FAD expression. The three curves are in precise agree-
ment at Lr = 1 because Equation (9.69) was derived from Equation (9.67). At other Lr values, there
is good agreement. Therefore, the shape of the FAD curve is relatively insensitive to geometry, andthe material-speciﬁc FAD expression agrees reasonably well with a rigorous J solution, provided
the reference stress is deﬁned by Equation (9.69) to Equation (9.71).
Figure 9.25 is a plot of the reference stress geometry factor F for a surface crack as a function
of crack front position and strain hardening. The reference stress solution is relatively insensitiveto the location on the crack front angle f (Figure 9.2), but F is a strong function of the hardening
exponent. Fortunately, the hardening dependence of F follows a predictable trend. The following
empirical expression relates F values at two hardening exponents:
(9.72)
The above expression was developed speciﬁcally for this chapter, and has not been publishedelsewhere as of this writing. Figure 9.26 is a plot of F vs. n for a surface crack in a plate subject
to membrane loading. The predicted curve was computed from Equation (9.72) using a reference-hardening exponent n
1 of 10. Note that F is insensitive to the ratio so/E for n > 3. Equation (9.72)
is less accurate for very high hardening materials, but most engineering alloys have hardeningexponents in the range .J

Figure 9.27 shows that Equation (9.72) also works for a plate in bending. Therefore, given a
reference stress solution for a speciﬁc geometry and hardening exponent, Equation (9.72) can be
used to estimate F for that same geometry with a different hardening exponent.
The above approach for deﬁning the reference stress also applies to cases where the loading
is more complex. For example, if the component is subject to both membrane and bending stress,Equation (9.70) can be written in terms of the membrane stress, and F would depend on the s
b/sm
ratio. Alternatively, separate estimates of reference stress can be made for the membrane andbending components and the effects can be combined to give the total reference stress. Unfortu-nately, linear superposition does not apply to reference stress because it is derived from elastic-plastic analysis. A method for inferring a reference stress for combined loading is outlined next.
Suppose that reference stress geometry factors for a given conﬁguration are available for both
pure membrane loading and pure bending:
(9.73a)
(9.73b)
If linear superposition were applicable, the reference stress for combined membrane and bendingloads could be inferred simply by summing the contributions from each. In reality, such an approachwill usually lead to an overestimate of the true reference stress. Figure 9.28 illustrates a moreaccurate approach, in which the two contributions to reference stress are treated as vectors orientedFIGURE 9.27 Correlation between the reference stress geometry factor and the hardening exponent for a

at an angle b from one another. The total reference stress for combined loading is equal to the sum
of these vectors. That is 
(9.74)
In order to determine the phase angle b, it is necessary to perform at least one elastic-plastic analysis
for combined loading at a ﬁxed sb/sm ratio. Once the phase angle is established for the geometry
of interest, Equation (9.74) can be used to compute reference stress for other sb/sm ratios.
The above methodology can be validated by performing a series of elastic-plastic ﬁnite element
analyses with a range of sb/sm ratios and inferring the angle b from Equation (9.74). Figure 9.29FIGURE 9.28 Vector summation method for combining reference stress solutions for two load cases. The

shows the results of such an exercise. The inferred phase angle is insensitive to the sb/sm ratio,
indicating that the vector summation method is appropriate for superimposing reference stress
solutions for two load cases.
When combined loading is present, such as membrane and bending stresses, the loading must
be proportional in order to apply the methodology outlined above. That is, the sb/sm ratio must be
constant as load is applied. In the plastic range, the sequence of loading is important. If, for example,the membrane stress is applied ﬁrst, followed by the bending, a different J might result than if the
two stress components were applied at a ﬁxed s
b/sm ratio. The FAD method and the reference
stress concept assume proportional loading, and may not be suitable for nonproportional elastic-plasticloading. The only accurate way to model nonproportional loading in the plastic range is throughﬁnite element analysis.
Welded components that include residual stresses represent a special case of nonproportional
loading where the FAD method is routinely applied. Residual stresses occur at the time of weldingand applied stresses are imposed in service, so the loading sequence is obviously not proportional.Procedures for applying the FAD method to welded components are described next.
9.4.5 A PPLICATION  TO WELDED  STRUCTURES
Welds introduce a number of complexities into a fracture analysis. The welding process invari-ably creates residual stresses in and around the weld. Geometric anomalies such as weldmisalignment create additional local stresses. The weld metal and heat-affected zone (HAZ)typically have different material properties than the base metal. The toughness properties of theweld must, of course, be taken into account in the material resistance. In addition, the differentstress-strain responses of the weld metal and base metal can have a signiﬁcant effect on thecrack driving force. The FAD method can be modiﬁed to consider each of these complexities,as described next.
9.4.5.1 Incorporating Weld Residual Stresses
Conventional welding processes entail fusing two parts together with molten metal. Welding is
similar to soldering and brazing in that respect. Unlike soldering and brazing, however, the weldmetal has a chemical composition that is close to that of the base metal. When weld metal coolsto the ambient temperature, the resulting thermal contraction is restrained by the surrounding basemetal. This restraint leads to residual stresses. In multi-pass welds the residual stress pattern reﬂectsthe complex thermal history of the weld region. In recent years, ﬁnite element simulation of weldinghas advanced to the point where realistic estimates of residual stress are possible [37].
Section 9.1.4 introduced the concept of primary, secondary, and residual stresses. Weld residual
stress is usually not considered in most design codes because it does not have a signiﬁcant effecton the tensile strength of the welded joint, provided the material is ductile. When a crack is present,however, residual stresses must be included in the crack driving force. Under linear elastic condi-tions, residual stresses are treated the same as any other stress, as Equation (9.21) indicates. Whenthere is local or global plastic deformation, residual stresses may relax or redistribute. The FADmethod can be modiﬁed to account for residual stresses, as outlined next.
Figure 9.30 is a schematic plot of crack driving force, in terms of K
J, vs. the applied primary stress.
The two curves compare the driving force for primary stresses only with a case where both primaryand tensile residual stresses are present. In the latter case, K
J > 0 when the applied primary stress is
zero because the residual stresses contribute to the crack driving force. At intermediate applied stresses,the K
J vs. stress curve is nonlinear because the combination of primary and residual stresses result in
crack-tip plasticity. At higher applied stresses, global plasticity results in relaxation of residual stresses.This phenomenon is known as mechanical stress relief . The two driving force curves in Figure 9.30
coincide in the fully plastic range because residual stresses have relaxed completely.1656_C009.fm  Page 423  Monday, May 23, 2005  3:58 PM
424 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The crack driving force can be plotted in FAD coordinates, as described in Section 9.4.2. The
FAD curves for the two cases described above are illustrated in Figure 9.31. For primary stresses
alone, the FAD curve is  deﬁned as before:
(9.75)
When residual stresses are present, the shape of the FAD curve is a function of the magnitude ofthe residual stresses:
(9.76)
Note that only primary stresses are included in L
r. The unusual shape of the FAD curve for the
weld with residual stress is due to crack-tip plasticity at intermediate Lr values and mechanicalFIGURE 9.30 Schematic plot of crack driving force vs. applied primary stress, with and without an imposed

stress relief at high Lr values. The FAD curve where residual stresses are present crosses the FAD
curve for primary stresses only, because Kr* is computed based on the original  elastic  values of
KIP and KIR. When residual stresses have relaxed, Kr* > Kr for a given Lr.
It is not particularly convenient to apply a FAD curve whose shape is a function of residual
stress. An alternative formulation, where the residual stress effects are decoupled from the FAD
curve, is preferable. Let us deﬁne the FAD curve as f1(Lr), which corresponds to the FAD in the
absence of residual stress (Equation (9.75)). When residual stresses are present, the K ratio can be
redeﬁned such that the resulting FAD curve exhibits the desired shape. This can be accomplishedby multiplying K
IR by an adjustment factor:
(9.77)
Solving for Φ gives
(9.78)
The Φ factor can be viewed as a plasticity adjustment. Figure 9.32 schematically illustrates the
relationship between Φ and applied stress. As Lr increases, the crack-tip plasticity magniﬁes the
total driving force, so Φ > 1. Eventually Φ reaches a peak and then decreases due to mechanical
stress relief. Figure 9.33 compares FAD curves deﬁned by Equation (9.76) and Equation (9.77).The two curves cross when Φ = 1.
The Φ factor can be derived from elastic-plastic ﬁnite element analysis. Various initial residual
stress distributions are imposed on a ﬁnite element model that contains a crack, and then primaryloads are applied. The J-integral results are plotted in terms of FAD curves (Figure 9.31) and Φ is
inferred from Equation (9.78). Ainsworth et al. [38] have developed expressions for Φ based on
earlier work by Hooton and Budden [39].

and Lr is computed from Equation (9.61). Comparing Equation (9.77) and Equation (9.79), we see
that the failure criterion is as is the case for the J-based FAD for primary stresses only
(Section 9.4.2).
9.4.5.2 Weld Misalignment
When plates or shells are welded, there is invariably some degree of misalignment. Figure 9.34
illustrates two common types of misalignment: centerline offset and angular misalignment. In bothinstances, the misalignment creates a local bending stress. This local stress usually does not make asigniﬁcant contribution to static overload failure, provided the material is ductile. Misalignmentstresses can, however, increase the risk of brittle fracture and shorten the fatigue life of a welded joint.
Equations for misalignment stresses have been developed for various weld geometries and types
of misalignment [12, 40, 41]. For example, consider a weld between two plates of equal thicknesswith a centerline offset e (Figure 9.34(a)). Applying standard beam equations leads to the following
relationship between the local bending stress and the remotely applied membrane stress:

Application to Structures 427
When applying the FAD method, it is customary to treat misalignment stresses in the same
way as weld residual stresses. That is, they are not included in the calculation of Lr, and the applied
stress-intensity factor due to misalignment stresses is multiplied by Φ.
In some respects, misalignment stresses are similar to residual stresses in the way they inﬂuence
structural behavior. They are normally not considered in design but should be included in crack
driving force calculations. As is the case with residual stress, misalignment stresses may relax withplastic deformation. With angular misalignment in welded plates, for example, applied stresses ator above the yield strength tend to straighten the weldment, thereby reducing the bending moment.
There is, however, a key difference between misalignment stress and weld residual stress. The
former is directly proportional to the applied stress, but residual stresses can exist in the absenceof applied loads. Therefore, misalignment stresses do not behave in exactly the same manner asresidual stresses, so the plasticity correction factor Φ in Equation (9.79) may not be rigorously
correct when applied to misalignment stresses.
9.4.5.3 Weld Strength Mismatch
In most welded structures, the base metal and weld metal have different tensile properties. The
weld metal is typically stronger than the base metal, but there are instances where the weld metalhas lower strength. A weldment is said to be overmatched  when the weld metal has higher strength
than the base metal. The reverse situation is known as an undermatched  weldment.
The mismatch in strength properties affects the crack driving force in the elastic-plastic and
fully plastic regimes. Mismatch in properties is normally not a signiﬁcant issue in the elastic rangebecause the weld metal and base metal typically have similar elastic constants. Figure 9.35 is aschematic plot of the crack driving force for a crack in a base metal as well as for a crack of thesame size in an overmatched weld. For the purpose of this illustration, the effect of residual stresson crack driving force is ignored, and the base metal and weld metal are assumed to have the same
FIGURE 9.35 Effect of weld strength mismatch on crack driving force. Strength mismatch effects can be taken
into account in the FAD method through the reference stress solution for the weldment. In this schematic, weld
residual stress is neglected, and the weld and base metal are assumed to have similar hardening characteristics.
1656_C009.fm  Page 427  Monday, May 23, 2005  3:58 PM
428 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
strain-hardening characteristics. Because the weld metal has higher yield strength than the base
metal, the upswing in the driving force curve occurs at a higher load in the weldment. At a ﬁxedload in the elastic-plastic regime, the driving force in the cracked weldment is signiﬁcantly lowerthan in the cracked base plate.
The effect of weld strength mismatch can be taken into account in the FAD method through
an appropriate deﬁnition of L
r [42], as Figure 9.35 illustrates. The reference stress for a weldment
should be deﬁned from the elastic-plastic J solution using the approach in Section 9.4.4 or another
self-consistent approach.
9.4.6 P RIMARY  VS. SECONDARY  STRESSES  IN THE FAD M ETHOD
The term secondary stress  was introduced in Section 9.1.4. Stresses that are typically classiﬁed as
secondary may include displacement-controlled loads such as thermal expansion as well as weldmisalignment stresses. In the FAD method, it is customary to treat secondary stresses the same asresidual stresses. Equation (9.79) can be modiﬁed to include secondary stresses:
(9.81)
where is the stress-intensity factor due to the combined effects of secondary and residualstresses. Only primary stresses are used in the calculation of L
r.
The classiﬁcation of stresses as primary and secondary is somewhat arbitrary, and it is not
always clear what the “correct” classiﬁcation should be. In some cases, loads that are categorizedas secondary by design codes are indistinguishable from primary loads as far as a crack is concerned.Thermal expansion stresses in piping, for example, normally should be treated as primary in a FADanalysis despite being categorized as secondary in the governing design code. Recall Section 9.3.3,which considered the stability of a cracked structure subject to a ﬁxed remote displacement. Thisconﬁguration was represented by a spring in series with a compliance of C
M. If CM is large, there
is a signiﬁcant amount of stored elastic energy in the system, and the behavior approaches that ofload control. In a large piping system, the system compliance and stored elastic energy are typicallyvery large, so thermal expansion behaves as a load-controlled stress for all practical purposes. Load-controlled stresses should always be treated as primary.
One of the traditional criteria for determining whether a stress should be treated as primary or
secondary in a FAD analysis is the degree to which the load might contribute to ductile overload(plastic collapse). The aforementioned piping example is a case in point. An improperly designedpiping system could experience buckling or ductile rupture due to thermal loads. Weld residualstress and misalignment stress, however, do not contribute signiﬁcantly to plastic collapse, so theyhave traditionally not been treated as primary in a FAD analysis.
The above criterion for stress classiﬁcation in the FAD method originally stems from the view
that K
r is the “fracture axis” and Lr is the “collapse axis.” All stresses potentially contribute to
brittle fracture, but only primary loads need be included in a plastic collapse or limit load analysis.The traditional deﬁnition of L
r in terms of the limit load solution for the cracked body has contributed
to the perception that the x and y coordinates of the FAD entail independent assessments of collapse
and fracture, respectively. This two-criterion viewpoint may have been appropriate for the originalFAD based on the strip-yield model (Section 9.4.1), but is less valid for a J-based FAD.
As Figure 9.19 illustrates, the shape of the FAD curve is a measure of the deviation from linear
elasticity. Therefore, the downward trend of K
r with increasing Lr represents a plasticity correction
on the crack driving force. When reference stress is deﬁned according to the procedure in Section 9.4.4rather than from a limit load solution, it is not appropriate to view L
r as a collapse parameter.
Rather, Lr is an indication of the degree of crack-tip plasticity.KKK

Application to Structures 429
The Φ factor that is applied to secondary and residual stress in Equation (9.79) is also a plasticity
correction. Unlike the FAD curve, however, there is not a simple monotonic relationship between
Φ and Lr , as Figure 9.32 illustrates. At low to intermediate values of Lr, where Φ > 1, it may make
little difference whether a given stress is included in KIP or KISR, as the example given below
illustrates.
Consider a case where a cracked structural component is subject to two types of load. Assume
that load A is deﬁnitely primary and is treated as such, but that it is unclear whether to treat load
B as primary or secondary. The FAD in Figure 9.36 illustrates the effect of the stress classiﬁcationon the assessment point. The solid point represents a baseline case, where both loads A and B are
included in K
r but no plasticity correction has applied to load B yet. If load B is treated as secondary,
the corresponding stress intensity must be multiplied by Φ, which results in an upward shift in Kr.
On the other hand, if load B is treated as primary, it must be included in Lr, resulting in a shift of
the assessment point to the right. In this hypothetical example, the end result of both assumptionswas the same. Namely, the assessment point falls on the FAD in either case. In general, the choiceof stress classiﬁcation will make some difference on the outcome of the assessment, but the effectmay be small in many instances.
One key difference between the Φ factor and the plasticity correction inherent in the FAD curve
is that the magnitude of the former decreases  at large L
r values due to mechanical stress relief.
Perhaps then the key question should be: Does the stress in question relax with plastic deformation
in a matter similar to r esidual stress ? If the answer is no, then the stress should be treated as
primary for the purpose of a FAD analysis. By this criterion, many instances of thermal stresswould be considered primary. In some instances, it may be appropriate to include weld misalignmentstress in K
ISR, but it is not clear that such a classiﬁcation is universally correct for all cases of weld
misalignment. Even if a stress does relax with plastic ﬂow, the rate at which this relaxation occursis a consideration. If large plastic strains are required to achieve signiﬁcant stress relaxation, thenit might be appropriate to classify the stress as primary.
Probably the best advice is: When in doubt, treat stresses as primary in a F AD analysis . This
is generally the most conservative approach.FIGURE 9.36 Schematic illustration of the effect of stress classiﬁcation on the location of the assessment
point. Load A is treated as primary but the correct classiﬁcation of load B is unclear. In this hypothetical
example, the net outcome of the analysis is the same irrespective of the classiﬁcation of load B.

9.4.7 D UCTILE-TEARING  ANALYSIS  WITH THE FAD
A ductile-tearing analysis can be performed with the FAD method. The approach is essentially identical
to that described in Section 9.3.3, except that the driving force and material resistance are plotted interms of K
r and Lr. Recall from Section 9.4.2 that the FAD curve is a dimensionless representation of
the driving force and that the assessment point represents the fracture toughness. When toughness isgiven in terms of a resistance curve, such data are plotted as a locus of assessment points on the FAD.
Figure 9.37 illustrates the construction of the assessment points from the resistance curve [43].
Note that both the crack size and fracture toughness are updated with crack growth. The assessmentpoints form a curve that moves downward and to the right initially. The curve may reach a minimumand then decrease, depending on the amount of crack growth.
Figure 9.38 illustrates three possible outcomes of a ductile-tearing analysis. If all assessment
points lie inside the FAD, no crack growth occurs. The case where the ﬁrst few assessment pointsfall outside of the FAD, but others lie inside the FAD, corresponds to a ﬁnite amount of stablecrack growth. If all assessment points fall outside of the FAD, the structure is unstable. The onsetof unstable crack growth occurs where the locus of assessment points is tangent to the FAD [43].
One limitation of the FAD method is that it implicitly assumes load control for all analyses.
Consequently, a ductile instability analysis would be conservative if the loading conditions wereactually closer to displacement control.
9.4.8 S TANDARDIZED  FAD-B ASED PROCEDURES
In 1976, the original FAD derived from the strip-yield model (Section 9.4.1) was incorporated intoa ﬂaw assessment procedure for the British electric power industry [31]. This procedure becameknown as the R6 method, which has subsequently undergone several revisions. The latest versionof R6, as of this writing, was published in 2001 and is the 4th revision [40]. The most recent versionof the R6 method no longer uses the strip-yield FAD. Rather, it reﬂects various improvements inthe FAD approach that have taken place over the past few decades. The R6 method offers a choicebetween simple, closed-form FAD expressions (Section 9.4.3) and more rigorous FAD descriptionsbased on elastic-plastic J-integral results. It addresses both fracture instability with a single tough-
ness value (Figure 9.20) and ductile-tearing analysis with a resistance curve (Figure 9.38).FIGURE 9.37 Ductile-tearing analysis with the FAD. A locus of assessment points is generated from the
resistance curve for the material of interest. Taken from Chell, G.G. and Milne, I., “Ductile Tearing Instability

Application to Structures 431
There are a number of other internationally recognized codiﬁed ﬂaw assessment procedures that
implement the FAD method. For example, the British Standards Institute (BSI) has published BS
7910:1999 [41],7 and the European Union conducted a cooperative research program that culminated
in the publication of the SINTAP document [35], which is an abbreviation for “structural integrityassessment procedures for European industry.” The R6, BS 7910, and SINTAP methods are verysimilar to one another, probably because many of the same individuals were involved in creating allthe three documents. A fourth European FAD-based approach was developed in Sweden [44].
In the U.S., the American Petroleum Institute has published API 579 [12], which is a compre-
hensive ﬁtness-for-service guide that addresses various types of ﬂaws and damage, including cracks,general corrosion, local corrosion, pitting, bulging, and weld misalignment. The API 579 assessmentof cracks implements the FAD method, and is similar in many respects to R6, BS 7910, and SINTAP.The API document, however, has a more extensive library of K
I solutions than the other documents.
Reference stress solutions in the current standardized FAD methods are based on limit load
and yield load solutions. Section 9.4.4 discusses the disadvantages of such an approach andintroduces a more rational deﬁnition of s
ref. This alternative procedure for deﬁning sref from
an elastic-plastic J solution (Equation (9.69) to Equation (9.71)) is described in Appendix B of
API 579. The API Fitness-for-Service Task Group has recently commissioned a ﬁnite elementstudy in which new reference stress solutions are being generated using the approach outlinedin Section 9.4.4. These new solutions will incorporate the effect of weld strength mismatch.
Another area of active research among the various committees charged with developing and
maintaining the FAD-based standards is the estimation of residual stress for common welded joints.In early ﬂaw assessment methods for welded structures, the weld residual stress was typicallyassumed to be uniform through the cross section with a magnitude equal to the yield strength ofthe material. This assumption was very conservative and has resulted in many unnecessary weldrepairs. In recent years, ﬁnite element methods have been used to simulate the welding processand compute weld residual stress. Most of the FAD-based standards include compendia of residualFIGURE 9.38 Examples of possible outcomes of a ductile-tearing assessment. Instability occurs when the
locus of assessment points is tangent to the FAD curve. Taken from Chell, G.G. and Milne, I., “Ductile

stress distributions that were inferred from ﬁnite element analysis. These compendia are continually
being updated as new residual stress solutions become available.
The latest version of the R6 document [40] includes a procedure to modify the FAD based on
a loss of crack-tip triaxiality. This constraint adjustment is based on some of the models and theoriespresented in Chapter 3 (e.g., the Q parameter and the T stress). However, most of the research into
constraint effects on fracture toughness has focused on base metals and relatively simple conﬁgu-rations. There does not yet appear to be a sufﬁcient technical basis to apply these models to cracksin complex welded components. The traditional approach, where similitude between standardlaboratory toughness specimens and structural components is assumed, is conservative.
9.5 PROB ABILISTIC FRA CTURE MECHANICS
Most fracture mechanics analyses are deterministic, i.e., a single value of fracture toughness isused to estimate the failure stress or critical crack size. Much of what happens in the real world,however, is not predictable. Since fracture toughness data in the ductile-brittle transition region arewidely scattered, it is not appropriate to view fracture toughness as a single-valued material constant.Other factors also introduce uncertainty into fracture analyses. A structure may contain a numberof ﬂaws of various sizes, orientations, and locations. Extraordinary events such as hurricanes, tidalwaves, and accidents can result in stresses signiﬁcantly above the intended design level. Advancesin ﬁnite element modeling of welding has led to improved estimates of residual stress, but thereare uncertainties associated with such estimates. Because of these complexities, fracture should beviewed probabilistically rather than deterministically.
Figure 9.39 is a schematic probabilistic fracture analysis. The curve on the left represents
the distribution of driving force in the structure K
J, while the curve on the right is the toughness
distribution Kmat. The former distribution depends on the uncertainties in stress and ﬂaw size.
When the distributions of the applied KJ and Kmat overlap, there is a ﬁnite probability of failure,
indicated by the shaded area. For example, suppose the cumulative distribution of the driving
FIGURE 9.39 Schematic probabilistic fracture analysis.
1656_C009.fm  Page 432  Monday, May 23, 2005  3:58 PM
Application to Structures 433
force is F1(KJ) and the cumulative toughness distribution is F2(Kmat). The failure probability Pf
is given by
(9.82)
Time-dependent crack growth, such as fatigue and stress corrosion cracking, can be taken into
account by applying the appropriate growth law to the ﬂaw distribution. Flaw growth would causethe applied K
J distribution to shift to the right with time, thereby increasing failure probability.
The overlap of two probability distributions (Figure 9.39) represents a fairly simple case. In
most practical situations, there is randomness or uncertainty associated with several variables, anda simple numerical integration to solve for P
f (Equation (9.82)) is not possible. Monte Carlo
simulation can estimate failure probability when there are multiple random variables. Such ananalysis is relatively easy to perform, since it merely involves incorporating a random numbergenerator into a deterministic model. Monte Carlo analysis is very inefﬁcient, however, as numerous“trials” are required for convergence. There are other more efﬁcient numerical algorithms forprobabilistic analysis, but they are more complex and more difﬁcult to implement than Monte Carloanalysis. The relative inefﬁciency of Monte Carlo analysis is no longer a signiﬁcant hindrance inmost instances because of the speed of modern-day computers.
The Monte Carlo and FAD methods are well suited to one another. Figure 9.40 shows the
results of a Monte Carlo FAD analysis. Each Monte Carlo trial results in a single assessment point.Uncertainties in the input parameters (e.g., toughness, ﬂaw size, applied stress, residual stress, andtensile properties) lead to uncertainties in K
r and Lr. The FAD in Figure 9.40 presents a compelling
visual presentation of this uncertainty. The failure probability is deﬁned as the number of pointsthat fall outside of the FAD curve divided by the total number of trials:

Fatigue Crack Propagation 
Most of the material in the preceding chapters dealt with static or monotonic loading of cracked
bodies. This chapter considers crack growth in the presence of cyclic stresses. The focus is onfatigue of metals, but many of the concepts presented in this chapter apply to other materialsas well.
In the early 1960s, Paris et al. [1,2] demonstrated that fracture mechanics is a useful tool for
characterizing crack growth by fatigue. Since that time, the application of fracture mechanics tofatigue problems has become fairly routine. There are, however, a number of controversial issuesand unanswered questions in this ﬁeld.
The procedures for analyzing constant amplitude fatigue 
1 
 under small-scale yielding condi-
tions are fairly well established, although a number of uncertainties remain. Variable amplitudeloading, large-scale plasticity, and short cracks introduce additional complications that are notfully understood.
This chapter summarizes the fundamental concepts and practical applications of the fracture
mechanics approach to fatigue crack propagation. Section 10.1 outlines the similitude concept,which provides the theoretical justiﬁcation for applying fracture mechanics to fatigue problems.This is followed by a summary of the more common empirical and semiempirical equationsfor characterizing fatigue crack growth. Subsequent sections discuss crack closure, the fatiguethreshold, variable amplitude loading, retardation, and growth of short cracks. The micromech-anisms of fatigue are also discussed brieﬂy. The ﬁnal two sections are geared to practicalapplications: Section 10.8 outlines procedures for experimental measurements of fatigue crackgrowth and Section 10.9 summarizes the damage tolerance approach to fatigue safe design.Appendix 10 at the end of this chapter addresses the applicability of the  
J 
 integral to cyclic
loading. 
10.1SIMILITUDE IN FATIGUE 
The concept of similitude, when it applies, provides the theoretical basis for fracture mechanics.Similitude implies that the crack-tip conditions are uniquely deﬁned by a single loading parametersuch as the stress-intensity factor. In the case of a stationary crack, two conﬁgurations will fail at thesame critical  
K 
 value, provided an elastic singularity zone exists at the crack tip (Section 2.9). Under
certain conditions, fatigue crack growth can also be characterized by the stress-intensity factor, asdiscussed next.
Consider a growing crack in the presence of a constant amplitude cyclic stress intensity (Figure 10.1).
A cyclic plastic zone forms at the crack tip, and the growing crack leaves behind a plastic wake.If the plastic zone is sufﬁciently small that it is embedded within an elastic singularity zone, theconditions at the crack tip are uniquely deﬁned by the current  
K 
 value, 
2 
 and the crack growth rate 
1  
In this chapter, constant amplitude loading is deﬁned as a constant  
stress-intensity 
 amplitude rather than constant stress
amplitude.

The justiﬁcation for the similitude assumption in fatigue is essentially identical to the dimensional argument for steady-
state crack growth (Section 3.5.2 and Appendix 3.5.2). If the tip of the growing crack is sufﬁciently far from its initial
position, and external boundaries are remote, the plastic zone size and width of the plastic wake will reach steady-state values.10

The inﬂuence of the plastic zone and plastic wake on crack growth is implicit in Equation (10.1),
since the size of the plastic zone depends only on  
K

 and  
K 
max 
.
A number of expressions for  
f

 have been proposed, most of which are empirical. Section 10.2
outlines some of the more common fatigue crack growth relationships. Equation (10.1) can beintegrated to estimate fatigue life. The number of cycles required to propagate a crack from aninitial length

Equation (10.3) violates the similitude assumption; two conﬁgurations cyclically loaded at the same 
∆ 
K 
 and 
 R 
 will not exhibit the same crack growth rate unless both conﬁgurations are subject to the
same prior history.
The similitude assumption may not be valid in certain instances of variable amplitude loading,
particularly when there are occasional overloads and underloads during the loading history.Section 10.5 discusses the reasons for history-dependent fatigue. Fatigue crack growth analysesbecome considerably more complicated when prior loading history is taken into account. Conse-quently, equations of the form of Equation (10.1) are applied whenever possible. It must be recognized,however, that such analyses are potentially subject to error in the case of variable amplitude loading.

Excessive plasticity during fatigue can violate similitude, since 
 K 
 no longer characterizes the
crack-tip conditions in such cases. A number of researchers [3, 4] have applied the  
J 
 integral to
fatigue accompanied by large-scale yielding; they have assumed a growth law of the form
(10.4)
where  
∆ 
J 
 is a contour integral for cyclic loading, analogous to the  
J 
 integral for monotonic loading
(see Appendix 10). Equation (10.4) is valid in the case of constant amplitude fatigue in small-scale
yielding because of the relationship between  
J 
 and 
 K 
 under linear elastic conditions. 
3 
 The validity
of Equation (10.4) in the presence of signiﬁcant plasticity is less clear, however.
Recall from Chapter 3 that deformation plasticity (i.e., nonlinear elasticity) is an essential
component of  
J 
 integral theory. When unloading occurs in an elastic-plastic material, deformation
plasticity theory no longer models the actual material response (see Figure 3.7). Consequently, theability of the  
J 
 integral to characterize fatigue crack growth in the presence of large-scale cyclic
plasticity is questionable, to say the least.
There is, however, some theoretical and experimental evidence in support of Equation (10.4).
If certain assumptions are made with respect to the loading and unloading branches of a cyclicstress-strain curve, it can be shown that  
∆ 
J 
 is path independent, and it uniquely characterizes the
change in stresses and strains in a given cycle [5, 6]. Appendix 10 summarizes this analysis.Experimental data [3, 4] indicate that  
∆ 
J 
 correlates crack growth data reasonably well in certain
cases. Several researchers have found that crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) may also be asuitable parameter for fatigue under elastic-plastic conditions [7].
The validity of Equation (10.4) has not been proven conclusively, but this approach appears to
be useful for many engineering problems. Of course, Equation (10.4) is subject to the samerestrictions on prior history as Equation (10.1). The crack growth rate may exhibit a history effectif

Figure 10.2 is a schematic log-log plot of

dN 
 vs. 
 ∆ 
K 
, which illustrates typical fatigue crack
growth behavior in metals. The sigmoidal curve contains three distinct regions. At intermediate  
∆ 
K 
values, the curve is linear, but the crack growth rate deviates from the linear trend at high and low 
∆ 
K 
 levels. At the low end,  
da 
/ 
dN 
 approaches zero at a threshold  
∆ 
K 
, below which the crack will
not grow. Section 10.4 explores the causes of this threshold. In some materials, the observed growthrate increases rapidly at high  
∆ 
K 
 values. There are two possible explanations for the Region III
behavior. Some researchers have hypothesized that the crack growth rate accelerates as  
K 
max 
approaches  
K 
c 
, the fracture toughness of the material. According to this hypothesis, microscopic
fracture events (e.g., pop-ins) contribute to crack growth, resulting in a higher overall growth rate.An alternative hypothesis is that the apparent acceleration in  
da 
/ 
dN 
 is not real but is due to the
inﬂuence of crack-tip plasticity on the true driving force for fatigue. At high  
K 
max 
values, linear
elastic fracture mechanics is no longer valid, and a parameter like  
∆ 
J 
 might be more appropriate
to characterize fatigue.

Paris and Erdogan [2] were apparently the ﬁrst to discover the power-law relationship for fatigue
crack growth in Region II. They proposed an exponent of 4, which was in line with their experi-
mental data. Subsequent studies over the past three decades, however, have shown that  
m 
 can range
from 2 to 4 for most metals in the absence of a corrosive environment. Equation (10.5) has becomewidely known as the  
Paris Law 
.
A number of researchers have developed equations that model all or part of the sigmoidal

and

 relationship [8–14]. Most of these equations are empirical, although some are based on
physical considerations. Forman [8] proposed the following relationship for Region II and Region III:
(10.6)
This equation can be rewritten in the following form:
(10.7)
Thus the crack growth rate becomes inﬁnite as  
K

K 
c 
. Of course, this equation is
based on the assumption that Region III behavior is caused by a superposition of fracture andfatigue rather than plastic zone effects. Note that the above relationship contains an

dependence, while Equation (10.5) assumes that

point is that the material constants C and m in the Forman equation do not have the same numerical
values or units as in the Paris-Erdogan equation (Equation (10.5)).
Klesnil and Lukas [10] modiﬁed Equation (10.5) to account for the threshold:
(10.8)
Donahue [11] suggested a similar equation, but with the exponent m applied to the quantity ( ∆K − ∆Kth).
In both cases, the threshold is a ﬁtting parameter to be determined experimentally. One problem
with these equations is that ∆Kth often depends on the  R ratio (see Section 10.4).
A number of equations attempt to describe the entire crack growth curve, taking account of
both the threshold and Stage III behavior. Most such relationships assume that Stage III occurswhen K
max approaches Kc, although this assumption does not appear to have been based on solid
experimental evidence.
The most common expression to describe fatigue crack growth in all three regions was devel-
oped at NASA and was ﬁrst published by Forman and Mettu [14]. This equation, in a slightlyFIGURE 10.3 Crack closure during fatigue crack growth. The crack faces contact at a positive load (a),

simpliﬁed form,4 is given by
(10.9)
where C, m, p, and q are material constants. At intermediate  ∆K values were ∆K >> ∆Kth and Kmax
<< Kc, Equation (10.9) reduces to Equation (10.5). Therefore, the C and m values for Equation
(10.5) and Equation (10.9) are equivalent.
Equation (10.5) to Equation (10.9) all have the form of Equation (10.1). Each of these equations
can be integrated to infer fatigue life (Equation (10.2)). The most general of these expressions
contains six material constants:5 C, m, p, q, Kcrit, and ∆ Kth. For a given material, the fatigue crack
growth rate depends only on the loading parameters ∆K and R , at least according to Equation (10.5)
to Equation (10.9). Therefore, all of the preceding expressions assume elastic similitude of thegrowing crack; none of these equations incorporate a history dependence, and, thus, are strictlyvalid only for constant (stress intensity) amplitude loading. Many of these formulas, however,were developed with variable amplitude loading in mind. Although there are many situationswhere similitude is a good assumption for variable amplitude loading, one must always bear inmind the potential for history effects. See Section 10.5 for additional discussion of this issue.
Dowling and Begley [3] applied the J integral to fatigue crack growth under large-scale yielding
conditions where  K is no longer valid. They ﬁt the growth rate data to a power-law expression in ∆J:

Appendix 10 outlines the theoretical justiﬁcation and limitations of J-based approaches for fatigue.

which can be integrated to determine fatigue life:
Closed-form integration is possible in this case because the K expression is relatively simple. In most
instances, numerical integration is required.
10.3 CRA CK CLOSURE
An accidental discovery by Elber [15] in 1970 resulted in several decades of research into a
phenomenon known as crack closure . He noticed an anomaly in the elastic compliance of several
fatigue specimens, which Figure 10.3(a) schematically illustrates. At high loads, the compliance(d∆/dP) agreed with standard formulas for fracture mechanics specimens (Appendix 7), but at low
loads, the compliance was close to that of an uncracked specimen. Elber believed that this changein compliance was due to the contact between crack surfaces (i.e., crack closure) at loads that werelow but greater than zero.
Elber postulated that crack closure decreased the fatigue crack growth rate by reducing the
effective stress-intensity range. Figure 10.3(b) illustrates the closure concept. When a specimen iscyclically loaded at K
max and Kmin, the crack faces are in contact below Kop, the stress intensity at
which the crack opens. Elber assumed that the portion of the cycle that is below Kop does not contribute
to fatigue crack growth because there is no change in crack-tip strain during cyclic loading of a closedcrack. He deﬁned an effective stress-intensity range as follows:
(10.11)
He also introduced an effective stress-intensity ratio:
(10.12)
Elber then proposed a modiﬁed Paris-Erdogan equation:
(10.13)
Equation (10.13) has been reasonably successful in correlating fatigue crack growth data at variousR ratios. The numerical value of the material constant C is different in Equation (10.5) and Equation
(10.13) if closure occurs in Region II, such that ∆K
eff < ∆K.
Since Elber’s original study, numerous researchers have conﬁrmed that crack closure does in
fact occur during fatigue crack propagation. Suresh and Ritchie [16] identiﬁed ﬁve mechanismsfor fatigue crack closure, which are illustrated in Figure 10.4.
Plasticity-induced closure, Figure 10.4(a), results from residual stresses in the plastic wake.
Budiansky and Hutchinson [17] applied the Dugdale-Barenblatt strip-yield model to this problemand showed that residual stretch in the plastic wake causes the crack faces to close at a positiveremote stress. Although quantitative predictions from the Budiansky and Hutchinson model do notagree with experimental data [18], this model is useful for demonstrating qualitatively the effectN

of plasticity on crack closure. A number of investigators [19–24] have studied plasticity-induced
closure with ﬁnite element analysis. James and Knott [25] performed an experiment that providedcompelling evidence for plasticity-induced closure. They grew a fatigue crack in a standard spec-imen and then used electron discharge machining to remove a small amount of material from thecrack faces up to 0.5 mm from the crack tip. When they placed the sample back into the testmachine, the crack growth rate increased by an order of magnitude compared to prior measurements.(a) (b)

Fatigue Crack Propagation 459
They concluded that the plastic wake behind the crack was causing closure and a reduced crack
growth rate, and that crack growth rate accelerated because the zone of compressive residual stressesin the plastic wake was removed by machining.
Roughness-induced closure, which is illustrated in Figure 10.4(b), is inﬂuenced by the micro-
structure. Although fatigue cracks propagate in pure Mode I conditions on a global scale, crackdeﬂections due to microstructural heterogeneity can lead to mixed mode conditions on the micro-scopic level. When the crack path deviates from the Mode I symmetry plane, the crack is subjectto Mode II displacements, as Figure 10.4(b) illustrates. These displacements cause mismatchbetween upper and lower crack faces, which in turn results in contact of crack faces at a positiveload. Coarse-grained materials usually produce a higher degree of surface roughness in fatigue,and correspondingly higher closure loads [26]. Figure 10.5 illustrates the effect of grain size onfatigue crack propagation in 1018 steel. At the lower  R ratio, where closure effects are most
pronounced, the coarse-grained material has a higher ∆K
th, due to a higher closure load that is
caused by greater surface roughness (Figure 10.5(b)). Note that grain size effects disappear whenthe data are characterized by ∆K
eff (Figure (10.5(c)).
Oxide-induced closure, Figure 10.4(c), is usually associated with an aggressive environment.
Oxide debris or other corrosion products become wedged between crack faces. Crack closure canalso be introduced by a viscous ﬂuid, as Figure 10.4(d) illustrates. The ﬂuid acts as a wedge betweencrack faces, somewhat like the oxide mechanism. A stress-induced martensitic transformation atthe tip of the growing crack can result in a process zone wake,
6 as Figure 10.4(e) illustrates.FIGURE 10.5 Effect of grain size on fatigue crack growth in mild steel. Taken from Gray, G.T., Williams,

460 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Residual stresses in the transformed zone can lead to crack closure. The relative importance of the
various closure mechanisms depends on microstructure, yield strength, and environment.
Three of the closure mechanisms illustrated in Figure 10.4 (roughness, corrosion product, and
viscous ﬂuid) involve crack wedging. That is, the crack is prevented from closing completely byan obstruction of some type. Strictly speaking, these mechanisms might be described more appro-priately by the term residual crack opening  rather than crack closure. The plasticity and phase
transformation mechanisms can be regarded as true crack closure because residual stress applies aclosure force to the crack faces. Both types of mechanisms can result in a diminished ∆K
eff, either
through premature closure or residual opening of the crack. Since the wedging mechanisms havetraditionally been referred to as “crack closure,” that convention will be adopted here despite itsshortcomings. Wedging mechanisms are discussed in greater detail in Section 10.3.1.
In principle, it should be possible to distinguish between plasticity-induced closure and wedging
mechanisms by observing the load-displacement curve. (Transformation-induced closure is rareand will be excluded from the present discussion.) Figure 10.6 schematically compares threescenarios: plasticity-induced closure, crack wedging, and mixed behavior. Load is plotted vs. crack-mouth-opening displacement (CMOD). Because the crack is actually closing as a result of theplasticity mechanism, the load-CMOD curve should pass through the origin. In the case of awedging mechanism, there will be a residual displacement at zero load, but the load-CMOD curveat high loads (when the crack is fully open) should extrapolate to the origin. When both mechanismsare present, there will be a positive residual displacement and the load-CMOD curve at high loadswill extrapolate to a negative displacement, as the third schematic in Figure 10.6 illustrates.
In an actual experiment, it would be possible to distinguish between the various behaviors
illustrated in Figure 10.6 only if the clip ga ge is zeroed before the start of cr acking . In many
experiments, the specimen is precracked without a clip gage, and the clip gage is inserted andzeroed later, after closure has had a chance to develop in the initial fatigue crack. In that case,it would not be possible to determine a true zero CMOD reference from the load-clip gage record.
10.3.1 A CLOSER LOOK AT CRACK-WEDGING  MECHANISMS
Consider an idealized scenario where a rigid wedge is inserted into an open crack, as Figure 10.7illustrates. Suppose that the shape of this wedge is such that the crack perfectly conforms to it whenthe load is removed. That is, assume that the crack faces contact the wedge at all points simultaneouslywhen the load is removed. As the applied load decreases to zero, the crack is held open at a ﬁxeddisplacement. An applied stress intensity of K
wedge exists at the crack tip despite the lack of an externallyFIGURE 10.6 Expected load-displacement behavior for: (a) plasticity-induced closure, (b) wedging mecha-
nisms, and (c) mixed behavior. In order to observe these trends, however, the clip gage must be zeroed prior
to the start of fatigue cracking.
1656_C010.fm  Page 460  Monday, May 23, 2005  6:02 PM
Fatigue Crack Propagation 461
applied load. When load is reapplied, K does not change until load is a sufﬁcient cause for a
crack-opening displacement greater than the width of the wedge. If this conﬁguration were loaded
cyclically, such that the crack faces were in contact with the wedge during the portion of each cycle,∆K
eff would equal the difference between Kmax and Kwedge, as Figure 10.7 illustrates.
Now assume that the crack contains a single rigid particle, as Figure 10.8 illustrates. As the
load is removed and the crack faces close, they eventually contact the particle. When this initialcontact occurs, the slope of the load-CMOD curve becomes steeper. As load is reduced further,portions of the crack face not in contact with the particle continue to close, resulting in a continualdecrease in the applied K. There is a small residual K when the load is removed completely. Unlike
the ideal wedge in Figure 10.7, however, ∆K
eff for cyclic loading is greater than that would be
inferred by deﬁning Kop at the point where the compliance changes. That is, one would overestimate
closure effects (and underestimate fatigue driving force) if he or she deﬁned the opening load wherethe slope changes.
Figure 10.7 and Figure 10.8 depict two extremes of crack-wedging behavior. Figure 10.9
illustrates a more realistic case, where the crack is ﬁlled with particles of various sizes. As the loadis relaxed, the slope of the load-CMOD curve gradually changes as more particles make contactwith the crack. Eventually, no further contact occurs and the CMOD attains a constant value,assuming the particles are rigid. In the real world, the ﬁnal slope of the load-CMOD curve wouldFIGURE 10.7 Load-displacement behavior and ∆Keff for an ideal wedge, which is rigid and conforms perfectly
to the crack-opening proﬁle.

462 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
reﬂect the elastic properties of the objects that ﬁll the crack.7 As was the case for the single-particle
scenario, deﬁning Kop at the point of initial slope change could lead to errors.
The important factor to keep in mind is how the wedging action (or plasticity-induced closure,
for that matter) affects the true driving force for fatigue. Deﬁning ∆Keff for an ideal wedge is
unambiguous and straightforward. More realistic cases are not quite so simple. Traditionally, the
measurement of Kop has been highly subjective, and different individuals and laboratories have
obtained widely varying results for a given material under the same test conditions. Section 10.8.3proposes a K
op deﬁnition that removes the subjectivity and provides a more accurate indication
of the effective ∆K. This new deﬁnition is based on the relationship between the applied load and
the true applied K. Figure 10.7 to Figure 10.9 show simpliﬁed examples of the proposed deﬁnition
of ∆Keff.FIGURE 10.8 Load-displacement behavior and ∆Keff for a single particle or asperity.
7 For laboratory specimens, there is an additional contribution from compliance of the machined notch. Even if the fatigue
crack is fully closed or wedged open, the faces of the notch are not in contact. The slope of the load vs. clip gage displacement
curve reﬂect the compliance of a notched but uncracked specimen, as Figure 10.3 illustrates.

10.3.2 E FFECTS  OF LOADING  VARIABLES  ON CLOSURE
Most experts believe that the stress intensity for crack closure is not actually a material constant,
but depends on a number of factors. Over the years, a number of investigators have attempted tocorrelate K
op to loading variables such as R ratio, but with limited success. Part of the problem lies
in the subjective nature of closure measurements, as discussed above. Another problem is thatdifferent closure behavior occurs in different alloys and in different loading regimes for a givenalloy. No single empirical correlation works for all situations. What follows is an overview of someof the attempts to correlate closure to loading variables.
Elber [15] measured the closure stress intensity in 2023-T3 aluminum at various load levels
and R  ratios, and obtained the following empirical relationship:
(10.14)
Subsequent researchers [27–29] inferred similar empirical expressions for other alloys. 
According to Equation (10.14), U depends only on R. Shih and Wei [30, 31], however, argued
that the Elber expression, as well as many of the subsequent equations, are oversimpliﬁed. Shihand Wei observed a dependence on K
max for crack closure in a Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy. They
also showed that experimental data of earlier researchers, when replotted, exhibit a deﬁnite Kmax
dependence.
There has been a great deal of confusion and controversy about the Kmax dependence of U.
Hudak and Davidson [18] cited contradictory examples from the literature where various researchersFIGURE 10.9 Load-displacement behavior and ∆Keff for a crack that is ﬁlled with multiple particles or
asperities of various sizes.

reported U to increase, decrease, or remain constant with increasing Kmax. Hudak and Davidson
performed closure measurements on a 7091 aluminum alloy and 304 stainless steel over a wide
range of loading variables. For both materials, they inferred a closure relationship of the form:
(10.15)
where Ko is a material constant. Hudak and Davidson concluded that the inconsistent results from
the literature could be attributed to a number of factors: (1) the range of ∆K values in the experiments
was too narrow; (2) the ∆K values were not sufﬁciently close to the threshold; and (3) the
measurement techniques lacked the required sensitivity.
The effect of loading variables on Kop can be inferred by substituting the relationships for U
into Equation (10.12). For example, the Elber implies the following relationship for Kop:
(10.16)
Note that the ratio  Kop/∆K depends only on the  R ratio. Equation (10.15), however, leads to a
different expression for Kop:
(10.17)
Thus Ko is the opening stress intensity for  R = 0.
Hudak and Davidson [18] attributed the confusion and controversy over the effect of loading
variables on closure to experimental factors. McClung [32] conducted an extensive review of exper-imental and analytical closure results and concluded that there are three distinct regimes of crackclosure. Near the threshold, closure levels decrease with increasing stress intensity, while U is
independent of K
max at intermediate ∆K levels. At high ∆K values, the specimen experiences a loss
in constraint, and U decreases with increasing stress intensity. McClung found that no single equation
could describe closure in all three regimes. According to McClung, most of the seemingly contradic-tory data in the literature can be reconciled by considering the regimes in which the data were collected.
Microstructural effects can also lead to differences in observed closure behavior in various
materials. Figure 10.5, for example, shows the effect of grain size on crack closure in 1018 steel.Moreover, various closure mechanisms can occur in different materials and environments, asFigure 10.4 illustrates. A correlation developed for, say, plasticity-induced closure cannot beexpected to apply to a situation where roughness-induced closure dominates.
10.4 THE FA TIGUE THRESHOLD
The fatigue threshold ∆Kth is the point below which a fatigue crack will not grow. Experimental
measurements of the threshold are usually inferred from a load-shedding procedure, where ∆K is
gradually reduced until the crack growth rate reaches a very small value. In most experiments inthe threshold range, either K
max or the R ratio is held constant, while ∆K is reduced. The way in
which the test is conducted can affect the measured ∆Kth for reasons described later. Section 10.8
describes the experimental procedures for measuring da/dN and ∆Kth.
Most experts believe that the threshold consists of two components: an intrinsic threshold that is
a material property, and an extrinsic component that is a function of loading variables such as the R
ratio. The precise mechanism for the intrinsic threshold has not been established, but several researchershave developed models based on dislocation emission from the crack tip [33] or blockage of slipUK

bands by grain boundaries [34] (see Section 10.7.2). Most experts believe that the R ratio effects on
the threshold are due to crack closure. This viewpoint is discussed in Section 10.4.1.
There is a minority opinion in the fatigue community that believes that closure plays a minor
role in fatigue behavior near the threshold. Instead, they believe that there are two intrinsic
thresholds: a ∆K threshold and a Kmax threshold. Section 10.4.2 describes this model.
Both points of view ﬁnd support in the published data. While the empirical evidence supports
a Kmax threshold, such a threshold is also consistent with the crack closure argument. The potential
proof of who is correct lies in closure measurements. That is, can closure measurements reconcilethe R ratio effect on ∆K
th? 
Unfortunately, this issue is clouded by the fact that traditional closure measurements are
notoriously subjective and inconsistent. There are examples in the literature where investigatorspurport to correct for R ratio effects in ∆K
th with closure measurements. Such measurements,
however, can potentially be biased by knowledge of the desired outcome. That is, knowing theintrinsic threshold after extrinsic effects are removed could inﬂuence the measurement of theapparent closure loads. Unless correlation comes from closure measurements that are made blindlywithout knowledge of the desired outcome, or if a completely unambiguous deﬁnition of closureis adopted, there will continue to be debates about the role of crack closure in the fatigue threshold.
10.4.1 T HE CLOSURE  MODEL FOR THE THRESHOLD
Figure 10.10 schematically illustrates the effect of crack closure on the apparent fatigue threshold.Let us assume that a given material has an intrinsic threshold ∆K
th*and that Kop is also a material
constant that is independent of the R ratio. The relationship between the apparent threshold ∆Kth
and the intrinsic threshold is given by
(10.18)
where U is deﬁned in Equation (10.12). Rewriting U in terms of ∆Kth and R gives

Substituting Equation (10.19) into Equation (10.18) and solving for ∆Kth leads to
(10.20)
where R* is the R ratio above which closure no longer exerts an inﬂuence, as Figure 10.10 illustrates;
R* is given by
(10.21)
Figure 10.11 is a schematic plot of Equation (10.20). This expression predicts that the threshold
stress intensity range varies linearly with R below R* and is constant at higher R ratios. Figure 10.12
is a plot of actual threshold data for a variety of steels. Equation (10.20) appears to provide a verygood description of the data. For most of the steels on this plot, R
* appears to be around 0.8 and
∆Kth* is between 2 and 3 MPa  The exception to the trend in Figure 10.12 is a 1590 MPa
(230 ksi) yield strength steel that does not exhibit an R ratio dependence. It turns out that Equation
(10.20) accurately describes the ratio dependence of ∆Kth in a wide range of alloys.
Figure 10.13 shows crack growth data for a mild steel in the threshold range at various R ratios
[7]. Crack growth is plotted against both ∆K and ∆Keff, where the latter quantity corresponds to
data corrected for closure by Equation (10.11). For the highest R ratios, closure was not observed,
so ∆K = ∆Keff. When data at lower R ratios are corrected for closure, the R ratio effect disappears
and all data exhibit the same threshold, which corresponds to ∆Kth* for the material. Provided the
closure measurements in Ref. [7] are accurate and unbiased, Figure 10.13 presents strong evidencein favor of the closure mechanism in the threshold range.
10.4.2 A TWO-CRITERION  MODEL
Vasudevan et al. [35–40] have proposed an alternative way of looking at threshold behavior. Theyargue that there are two intrinsic thresholds, one on ∆K and one on K
max. They believe that the latter
parameter is not associated with closure. Rather, they contend that the Kmax threshold reﬂects the
minimum stress-intensity level that must be achieved at the crack tip for fatigue damage to occur,FIGURE 10.11 Schematic illustration of the effect of R ratio on ∆Kth, as implied by Figure 10.10.

and it is an intrinsic material property. They point out that their approach is analogous to the Goodman
diagram for S-N curves, where fatigue life is a function of both stress amplitude and mean stress.
Figure 10.14 is a schematic illustration of the two-criterion threshold concept. The two thresholds
on cyclic stress intensity ∆Kth*and maximum stress intensity Kmax*form an L-shaped curve. Both
thresholds must be exceeded for crack growth to occur, according to this model. Figure 10.15 shows anL-shaped threshold plot for Ti – 6Al – V [35]. 
Referring to the right-hand side of Figure 10.14, we see that when an L-shaped threshold curve
is plotted as ∆K
th vs. R, the resulting trend is identical to Figure 10.11. This trend can be expressed
mathematically as follows:
Therefore, the existence of thresholds for both Kmax and ∆K is wholly consistent with the closure
argument. If the R ratio effects on the measured threshold are, indeed, a result of crack closure,
then the Kmax threshold is simply the sum of the opening K and the intrinsic ∆K threshold:
(10.22)
However, Vasudevan et al. [35–40] contend that Kmax*is an intrinsic material property, not the result
of crack closure. Their main arguments are threefold:FIGURE 10.12 Effect of R ratio on the threshold stress-intensity range for various steels. Taken from Tanaka,

1. A comparison of threshold data for air and vacuum environments indicates that plasticity-
induced closure is not a signiﬁcant factor in the threshold region.
2. While roughness-induced closure can occur to some degree, traditional methods that deﬁne
closure from changes in the slope of the load-displacement curve grossly overestimate Kop.
3. Closure measurements tend to be highly scattered, but the R ratio dependence of ∆Kth
is highly consistent and reproducible. If closure were responsible for the R ratio effects,
they argue, ∆Kth should exhibit scatter comparable to that of Kop.
The ﬁrst point appears to have some merit, as discussed later, but the other two arguments are
less convincing. The contention that closure measurements grossly overestimate the true closure
behavior is based largely on an analysis similar to the single-particle model illustrated inFigure 10.8. If crack wedging, either through roughness or a corrosion product, were indeedcontrolled by a single obstruction or asperity, Vasudevan and his colleagues would be correct thatdeﬁning K
op at the point at which the slope changes would lead to a gross overestimate of the effect
of closure on the fatigue driving force. Figure 10.9 illustrates a more realistic case, where thereare multiple obstructions or asperities along the entire crack face. Although there is a ﬁnite loadrange where the compliance is continually changing due to an increasing number of obstructionscoming into contact with the crack face, the true K
op, as deﬁned in Figure 10.9, generally occurs
relatively close to the initial contact point. The region of nonlinearity in the load-displacementcurve has led to somewhat subjective deﬁnitions of closure. The ambiguity in closure measurementsis undoubtedly partially responsible for the observed scatter. If a self-consistent and physicallybased deﬁnition of K
op is adopted (Section 10.8.3), the scatter in closure measurements may well
reduce to a level of scatter comparable to that observed in ∆Kth measurements.FIGURE 10.15 Threshold ∆K vs. Kmax for Ti – 6Al – 4V . These threshold data were generated using the

10.4.3 T HRESHOLD  BEHAVIOR  IN INERT ENVIRONMENTS
When fatigue crack growth experiments are performed in a vacuum environment, the data can be
signiﬁcantly different from that in air. One does not normally think of air as a corrosive environment,but there is deﬁnitely an environmental interaction when air is present at the tip of a fatigue crack. Theseeffects can be particularly pronounced in the threshold region. The primary corrosive agents in air areapparently moisture combined with oxygen, because the environmental interaction increases withrelative humidity. By comparing the threshold behavior for a given material in air and vacuum environ-ments, it is possible to infer information about the role, if any, of plasticity-induced closure on ∆K
th.
Figure 10.16 compares air and vacuum threshold values for a 7075 aluminum alloy [40]. The
threshold in air is signiﬁcantly less than in a purely inert environment, especially at high R ratios.
Moreover, the vacuum data do not exhibit an R ratio dependence for positive values of R. It appears
that signiﬁcant crack closure is deﬁnitely not occurring in the vacuum. Most fatigue experts viewthe existence of an R ratio dependence on ∆K
th as an indication of closure effects. The reverse
argument is that the absence  of an R ratio dependence on ∆Kth in a speciﬁc data set would imply
the lack of signiﬁcant closure.8 The formation of a plastic zone in front of the crack and the plasticFIGURE 10.16 Comparison of ∆Kth for an aluminum alloy in air and vacuum environments. Taken from

Journal of Fatigue , V ol. 23, 2001, pp. S39–S53.
8 The lack of an R ratio effect on the threshold is not absolute proof of the absence of closure. It is theoretically possible for
∆Kth to be independent of the R ratio in the presence of closure if Kop exhibits an R ratio dependence that exactly cancels the
effect indicated by Equation (10.20). Such a coincidence appears unlikely, however. If Kop did have such an R ratio dependence
in a vacuum environment, one would expect the same dependence to occur in air if Kop was driven by plasticity-induced closure.

wake behind the crack tip should not be affected by the presence or absence of air in the crack. If
signiﬁcant closure is not occurring in the vacuum data, the R ratio dependence of ∆Kth for the air
data cannot be due to plasticity-induced closure.
Even if plasticity-induced closure does not play a signiﬁcant role near the threshold, there is
compelling evidence that other closure mechanisms are important in this regime. The published literaturecontains multiple data sets like Figure10.5 and Figure 10.13, where the R ratio dependence of ∆K
th has
been correlated with closure measurements. There are many sets of corrosion fatigue data where themeasured ∆K
th is elevated (relative to the value in air) due to corrosion product wedging in the crack.
The most likely explanation for the different closure behavior in air and vacuum is associated
with surface morphology. Fatigue crack growth in moist air is typically transgranular in the thresholdregime, as discussed in Section 10.7. This cleavage-like crack path is apparently due to environmentalinteractions, and it apparently results in roughness-induced closure. Fatigue crack growth in an inertenvironment is relatively planar, so the roughness-induced closure is not as signiﬁcant.
The differing behavior between air and inert environments in Figure 10.16 is fairly typical for
a range of alloys. Vasudevan et al. [35] have compiled published threshold data for a variety ofalloy systems and plotted ∆K
th vs. Kmax to obtain L-shaped threshold curves like Figure 10.14 and
Figure 10.15. The dual thresholds inferred from such plots, ∆Kth*and Kmax*,were then correlated to
each other for both air and vacuum environments. Figure 10.17 shows the results of this exercise.There is approximately a 1:1 correlation between the two thresholds in a vacuum environment.Referring to Equation (10.22), this implies that in a vacuum environment near the threshold.The trend for the air data has a slope of 0.4, which implies that , assuming closure isresponsible for the observed R ratio effects.

Figure 10.18 is a replot of the data from Figure 10.17 in terms of the apparent Kop, which was
inferred from Equation (10.22). The authors who originally created the ∆Kth*– Kmax*plot would
probably object to having their data re-plotted in this manner because they contend that the Kmax
threshold is not driven by closure. Nevertheless, Figure 10.18 supports their opinion that plasticity-
induced closure does not play a signiﬁcant role near the threshold. The apparent Kop for the vacuum
data is approximately zero, which would not be the case if plasticity-induced closure was occurringto any signiﬁcant degree.
The fatigue threshold in a vacuum environment exhibits an R ratio dependence at negative R
values. Figure 10.19 schematically illustrates the typical threshold behavior at positive and negativeR ratios for both air and vacuum environments. It is intuitively obvious that closure would play arole when the R ratio is negative, because compressive loads would force the crack faces together.
For the special case where R < 0 and K
op = 0, ∆Keff = Kmax, and only the tensile part of the cycle
contributes to fatigue damage.
Finally, it should be noted that the role of plasticity-induced closure in the threshold regime is
a controversial topic, and is the subject of ongoing studies. Proponents of plasticity-induced closurecite more recent data (unpublished as of this writing) where tests in vacuum do exhibit an R ratio
dependence.
There are certain instances where plasticity does appear to inﬂuence the threshold measurement,
whether in air or vacuum environments. In the load-shedding test procedure, for example, where ∆K
is reduced at a constant K
max or constant R ratio, the measured threshold can be artiﬁcially elevated
if ∆K decreases too abruptly. Such results imply that the plastic wake produced at higher ∆K levelsFIGURE 10.18 Data from Figure 10.17, replotted in terms of the apparent Kop, as estimated from
Equation  (10.22).

affects the threshold measurement unless the decrease in ∆K is sufﬁciently gradual that the crack tip
can grow beyond the inﬂuence of the earlier plasticity. New test procedures are being developed for
the threshold regime to avoid the potential pitfalls of the load-shedding method. One such techniqueinvolves testing at constant load amplitude following precracking in compression [41].
10.5 V ARIABLE AMPLITUDE LOADING AND RETARDATION
Similitude of crack-tip conditions, which implies a unique relationship between da/dN, ∆K, and R,
is rigorously valid only for constant amplitude loading (i.e., dK/da = 0). Real structures, however,
seldom conform to this ideal. A typical structure experiences a spectrum of stresses over its lifetime.In such cases, the crack growth rate at any moment in time may depend on the prior history aswell as current loading conditions. Equation (10.3) is a general mathematical representation of thedependence on past and present conditions.
Variable amplitude fatigue analyses that account for prior loading history are considerably
more cumbersome than analyses that assume similitude. Therefore, the latter type of analysis isdesirable if the similitude assumption is justiﬁed. There are many practical situations where suchan assumption is reasonable. Such cases normally involve cyclic loading at high R ratios, where
crack closure effects are negligible. Steel bridges, for example, have high dead loads due to theirown weight, which translates into high R ratios. Fatigue of welds that have not been stress relieved
often obey similitude because tensile residual stresses, which are static, increase the effectiveR ratio.
When similitude applies, at least approximately, the linear damage model  is suitable for variable
amplitude loading. There are a variety of other variable amplitude fatigue models that account forhistory effects. The linear damage model is described in the next section. This is followed by adiscussion of the mechanisms for history dependence, as well as an overview of existing modelsthat attempt to include history effects.FIGURE 10.19 Schematic illustration of the threshold behavior in air and vacuum environments, at both
positive and negative R ratios.

10.5.1 L INEAR DAMAGE  MODEL FOR VARIABLE  AMPLITUDE  FATIGUE
Consider a case where a cracked component experiences N1 cycles at a cyclic stress of ∆s1, N2
cycles at ∆s2, and so on. The total crack growth during this load history is ∆a. If we assume that
, such that da/dN for a given cyclic stress does not change signiﬁcantly during the loading
history,9 the crack growth can be estimated as follows:
(10.23)
If the crack growth is described by the Paris equation (Equation (10.5)), the above expression
becomes:
(10.24)
where Y is a geometry factor in the stress-intensity solution. It is possible to deﬁne an equivalent
constant amplitude stress range from Equation (10.24):
(10.25)
This weighted average cyclic stress corresponds to an average growth rate for the loading spectrumat a given crack size:
(10.26)
Life prediction is performed as if the loading were constant amplitude, with  outside of the integral:
(10.27)
The above procedure for handling variable amplitude loading must be modiﬁed when account-
ing for a threshold. Consider the following simpliﬁed growth law:
(10.28)
In this case, an equivalent constant amplitude stress can still be computed from Equation (10.25).However, only cyclic stresses that contribute to fatigue should be included in the summation. Thisconcept is illustrated in Figure 10.20. The threshold cyclic stress is given by
(10.29)
Stresses below ∆s
th do not contribute to fatigue damage, and thus should not be included in the
numerator in Equation (10.25). However, Ntot in the denominator should include all cycles, even
9 The assumption of small crack growth during the load history is not actually necessary, but such an assumption makes
the derivation easier to follow. A more rigorous derivation would consider the integrated average growth rate over the
interval a to a + ∆a. The ﬁnal result would not change, however.∆aa<<

those that do not contribute to fatigue damage. One complication of introducing a threshold is that
∆sth is a function of crack size. As the crack grows, ∆sth decreases and a larger fraction of the loading
spectrum contributes to fatigue. Consequently, must remain inside of the integral (Equation(10.27)) because it is a function of crack size.
We can generalize the linear damage model for an arbitrary growth law by computing an average
crack growth rate for the loading spectrum:
(10.30)
Figure 10.21 illustrates the construction of a da/dN histogram from a cyclic stress histogram and
the crack growth law. Note that the unshaded histogram bar on the left-hand side of the diagramrepresents cyclic stress levels where da/dN = 0. The total number of cycles in the above expression,
N
tot, must include all cycles, including those where da/dN = 0.10 Life prediction is achieved through
integration of the average growth rate:
(10.31)
Of course, the da/dN histogram and the average crack growth rate are a function of crack size, so
they must be continually recomputed during the life calculation.
10.5.2 R EVERSE  PLASTICITY  AT THE CRACK TIP
History effects in fatigue are a direct result of the history dependence of plastic deformation.Figure 10.22 schematically illustrates the cyclic stress-strain response of an elastic-plastic materialwhich is loaded beyond yield in both tension and compression. If we wish to know the stress at aparticular strain e
*, it is not sufﬁcient merely to specify the strain. For the loading path inFIGURE 10.20 Schematic cyclic stress histogram. Only cycles below ∆sth contribute to fatigue damage. This
threshold cyclic stress decreases with crack growth in accordance with Equation (10.29).
10 Consider the following analogy. A professor gives a ﬁnal exam to a class of 30 students. However, three out of the 30 students
do not show up for the exam, so they each receive a score of zero. When computing the average score for the exam, the
professor adds up the total scores of all students and divides by 30. The three scores of zero bring down the average score forthe class in the same way that fatigue cycles below the threshold reduce the average da/dN for the loading spectrum.

surrounding elastic material forces the material at the crack-tip to conform to its original shape.
This results in compressive residual stresses in the former plastic zone. A smaller compressiveplastic zone forms close to the crack tip [42, 43]

Now consider the case where the cracked plate is compressively loaded after having previously
been loaded in tension. Figure 10.27 illustrates the deformation at the crack tip under this scenario.The crack faces are forced together as a result of the compressive stress.

the overload, the plastic zone would have reached a steady-state size, but the overload cycle produces
a signiﬁcantly larger plastic zone. When the load drops to the original Kmin and Kmax, the residual
stresses that result from the overload plastic zone (Figure 10.26) are likely to inﬂuence subsequentfatigue behavior.
Figure 10.31 illustrates the typical behavior following an overload. Retardation , where the
crack growth rate decelerates by an order of magnitude or more, generally results from an overload.In some instances, there is a brief period of acceleration in da/dN following an overload, and
retardation occurs later. As the crack grows following the overload, the rate eventually approachesthat observed for constant amplitude loading immediately prior to the overload.
Three possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain retardation following an overload:
1. The crack blunts following an overload, and crack growth is delayed while the crack tip
resharpens.
2. The compressive residual stresses in front of the crack tip (Figure 10.23 and Figure 10.26)
retard the crack growth rate.
3. As the crack grows into the overload zone, residual stresses behind the crack tip result
in plasticity-induced closure.
The crack blunting theory was popular at one time, but it has since been rejected by most experts.
The second explanation is favored by proponents of a dual ∆K – K
max threshold (Section 10.4.2).FIGURE 10.25 Crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) results obtained from an elastic-plastic ﬁnite

The compressive residual stresses in front of the crack, they argue, result in a reduction in Kmax,
and thus a reduction in crack growth rate. However, the majority opinion among fatigue specialists
is that plasticity-induced closure is responsible for retardation effects.
Perhaps the most compelling evidence in favor of the closure argument is the phenomenon of
delayed retardation . That is, retardation generally does not occur immediately following the appli-
cation of an overload. In some cases, the crack growth rate actually accelerates for a brief periodafter the overload, as Figure 10.31 illustrates. If retardation were driven by a reduced K
max due to
compressive stresses in front of the crack tip, one would expect the effect to be immediate. Theelastic-plastic ﬁnite element results presented in Figure 10.24 to Figure 10.26 clearly show that thecrack-tip stresses are compressive following the application and removal of a tensile stress. Moreover,the J integral is actually negative when the applied load is removed. Therefore, the reduction in
K
max is immediate following an overload, but the reduction in crack growth rate is delayed.
The closure mechanism provides a plausible explanation for the momentary acceleration of
crack growth rate following an overload. If closure is occurring during constant amplitude loading,∆K
eff < ∆K and the crack growth rate is less than it would be in the absence of closure. When an
overload is applied, the resulting crack blunting causes the crack faces to move apart. Closure doesnot occur in the cycles immediately following the overload, so the crack growth rate is momentarilyhigher than it was prior to the overload. Once the crack grows a short distance into the overloadzone, compressive residual stresses result in plasticity-induced closure, which in turn results inretardation.FIGURE 10.26 Normal stress vs. distance from the crack tip computed from an elastic-plastic ﬁnite element

Figure 10.32 illustrates the closure mechanism for retardation. The blunting following the
overload may result in a momentary acceleration due to the absence of closure, but retardation
occurs once the crack grows into the overload zone.
Proponents of the dual ∆K – Kmax threshold concept reject the closure mechanism for retardation.
They explain delayed retardation and momentary acceleration by invoking the concept of “internalstresses” which inﬂuence the effective fatigue driving force [38]. They argue that tensile stresses occurimmediately behind the crack tip following an overload. However, this argument seems to run counterto their assertion that stresses in front of the crack tip drive fatigue. Moreover, the elastic-plastic ﬁnite
element analysis results in Figure 10.24 to Figure 10.26 indicate that the crack driving force, asquantiﬁed by the J integral, is negative following the application of a tensile overload.
Underloads (i.e., a compressive load or a tensile load that is well below previous minimum loads)
can result in an acceleration of crack growth or a reduction in the level of retardation. In certaincircumstances, an underload can produce tensile residual stresses at the crack tip. Figure 10.27illustrates this phenomenon. A blunted crack is forced closed by a compressive underload. The crackresharpens and a tensile residual stress forms ahead of the crack tip, as the ﬁnite element results inFigure 10.28 and Figure 10.29 illustrate. In order for an underload to produce a tensile residual stresszone, the crack must be blunted and open at the time of the underload. If the crack faces are in contactat the time an underload is applied, a tensile residual stress zone will not form at the crack tip, butcompressive forces on the crack faces may ﬂatten asperities. This may have the effect of reducingthe magnitude of roughness-induced closure in subsequent crack growth.FIGURE 10.28 Crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) obtained from an elastic-plastic ﬁnite element anal-

10.5.4 M ODELS  FOR RETARDATION  AND VARIABLE  AMPLITUDE  FATIGUE
A number of models have been proposed to account for load interaction effects in fatigue crack
propagation. The earliest models assume that history effects stem from residual stresses in frontof the crack tip due to overloads and underloads. More recent models are based on the assumptionthat plasticity-induced closure is responsible for load interaction effects.
Retardation models developed by Wheeler [44] and Willenborg et al. [45] are based on the
premise that residual stresses in front of the crack inﬂuence the growth rate. Figure 10.33 illustratesfatigue crack growth following an overload. The overload produced a plastic zone of size r
y(o) and
the crack has grown a distance ∆a following the overload. The current plastic zone size is ry(o).
Both the Wheeler and Willenborg models relate the current crack growth rate to the distance thecrack has grown into the overload zone.FIGURE 10.31 Typical crack growth behavior following the application of a single overload.

The Wheeler model contains a retardation factor fR, which is a function of the relative amount
of crack growth into the overload zone.
(10.32)
where g is a ﬁtting parameter. The crack growth rate is reduced from a baseline value by fR:
(10.33)
The overload plastic zone size can be estimated from the following expression:
(10.34)
where Ko is the stress intensity at the peak overload, and b = 2 for plane stress and b = 6 for plane
strain. The plastic zone size that corresponds to the current Kmax is given by
(10.35)
Wheeler assumed that retardation effects persist as long as the current plastic zone is contained
within the overload zone, but the effects disappear when the current plastic zone touches the outerboundary of the overload zone.
Unlike the Wheeler model, the Willenborg model does not contain a ﬁtting parameter. Willenborg
et al. deﬁned a residual stress-intensity factor as follows:

They then introduced an effective R ratio:
(10.37)
In order for the Willenborg model to have any effect on the fatigue calculation, the growth equation
must include an R ratio dependence. For example, the Walker expression [13] is a modiﬁcation of
the Paris power law:
(10.38)
where n is a material constant. When applying the Willenborg model, Reff is substituted into Equation
(10.38) in place of R. The same is true for any growth equation that includes an R ratio dependence.
Retardation models such as the Wheeler and Willenborg approaches can be applied to variable
amplitude loading. These models are implemented in much the same manner as for overload cases,except that K
o and the current Kmax must be evaluated for each cycle in a variable amplitude problem.
Figure 10.34 illustrates the basic concept. The most recent overload is used to compute the currentcrack growth rate. In the example depicted in Figure 10.34, the second overload is used to computer
y(o) because this overload zone extends further ahead of the current crack tip.

Figure 10.35 shows a ﬂow chart for computing fatigue crack growth with the Wheeler model.
Although the algorithm is relatively simple, the analysis can be very time consuming, since a cycle-
by-cycle summation is required. The stress input consists of two components: the spectrum andthe sequence. The former is a statistical distribution of stress amplitudes, which quantiﬁes therelative frequency of low, medium, and high stress cycles. The sequence, which deﬁnes the orderof the various stress amplitudes, can be either random or a regular pattern.
An alternative to retardation models that focus on residual stress in front of the crack tip is a
closure-based model. A number of investigators have extended the Dugdale-Barenblatt strip-yieldmodel to a growing crack. Budiansky and Hutchinson [17] developed an analytical model forplasticity-induced closure based modiﬁed strip-yield model, which incorporates residual stressesin the wake behind the crack tip. Newman [46] has developed a numerical crack closure modelthat is also a modiﬁcation of the Dugdale-Barenblatt strip-yield concept. The Newman numericalmodel can be applied to variable amplitude fatigue analysis, but the Budiansky and Hutchinsonanalytical model is not well suited to engineering problems.
Figure 10.36 illustrates the Newman closure model. The plastic zone is divided into discrete
segments. As the crack advances, segments are broken and become part of the plastic wake. Theresidual stress in each broken segment is computed from the maximum stretch the segment wasFIGURE 10.35 Flow chart for variable amplitude fatigue analysis with the Wheeler model.

subjected to when it was intact. At the maximum far-ﬁeld stress Smax, the crack is fully open, and
plastic zone is stressed to asy, where a = 1 for plane stress and a = 3 for plane strain. At the
minimum stress Smin, the crack is closed. The residual stress distribution in the plastic wake
determines the far-ﬁeld opening stress So. The effective stress intensity Keff is then computed from
the effective stress amplitude Smax − So. Load interaction and history effects are accounted for
through their inﬂuence on the calculated opening stress.
10.6 GRO WTH OF SHORT CRACKS
The concepts of fracture mechanics similitude and a ∆K threshold break down near the point of
crack initiation. Were this not the case, fatigue cracks would never nucleate from a smooth surface
because ∆K = 0 when crack size = 0. Figure 10.37 illustrates the effect of crack size on the threshold
stress for fatigue ∆sth. Equation (10.29) describes the relationship between ∆sth and crack size
when fracture mechanics similitude applies. According to Equation (10.29), ∆sth is proportional to
a−1/2, provided the crack is sufﬁciently small that the geometry factor Y is constant. This relationship
implies that the stress required to nucleate a crack is inﬁnite. In reality, ∆sth reaches a plateau for
very small cracks. This plateau represents the minimum cyclic stress required to nucleate a crackfrom a smooth surface. The short crack regime  corresponds to the transition from crack nucleation
regime to the long crack regime where fracture mechanics similitude applies.
The fatigue behavior of short cracks is often very different from that of longer cracks. There
is not a precise deﬁnition of what constitutes a “short” crack, but most experts consider cracks lessthan 1 mm deep to be small. Because most fatigue cracks spend the vast majority of their lives asshort cracks, the behavior of such ﬂaws is of signiﬁcant practical importance.FIGURE 10.36 The Newman closure model.

Figure 10.38 compares short crack data with long crack data near the threshold [47]. In this
case, the short cracks were initiated from a blunt notch. Note that the short cracks exhibit ﬁnite
growth rates well below ∆Kth for long cracks. Also, the trend in da/dN is inconsistent with expected
behavior; the crack growth rate actually decreases with ∆K when the stress range is 60 MPa, and
the da/dN − ∆K curve exhibits a minimum at the other stress level.FIGURE 10.37 Relationship between threshold cyclic stress ∆sth and crack size. Fracture mechanics simil-
itude does not apply in the crack nucleation regime.

Fatigue Crack Propagation 491
A number of factors can contribute to the anomalous behavior of small fatigue cracks. The
fatigue mechanisms depend on whether the crack is microstructurally short or mechanically short,
as described in the next section.
10.6.1 M ICROSTRUCTURALLY  SHORT CRACKS
A microstructurally short crack has dimensions that are on the order of the grain size. Cracks lessthan 100 µm long are generally considered microstructurally short. The material no longer behavesas a homogeneous isotropic continuum at such length scales; the growth is strongly inﬂuenced bymicrostructural features in such cases. The growth of microstructurally short cracks is often verysporadic; the crack may grow rapidly at certain intervals, and then virtually arrest when it encountersbarriers such as grain boundaries and second-phase particles [7]. Potirniche et al. [48] have simulatedsmall fatigue crack growth near a grain boundary using ﬁnite element analysis and constitutivematerial relations derived from crystal plasticity theory, which considers the plastically anisotropicbehavior of individual grains.
10.6.2 M ECHANICALLY  SHORT CRACKS
A crack that is between 100 µm and 1 mm in depth is mechanically short. The size is sufﬁcient to
apply continuum theory, but the mechanical behavior is not the same as in longer cracks. Mechanicallyshort cracks typically grow much faster than long cracks at the same ∆K level, particularly near the
threshold (Figure 10.38).
Two factors have been identiﬁed as contributing to faster growth of short cracks: plastic zone
size and crack closure.
When the plastic zone size is signiﬁcant compared to the crack length, an elastic singularity
does not exist at the crack tip, and  K is invalid. The effective driving force can be estimated by
adding an Irwin plastic zone correction. El Haddad et al. [49] introduced an “intrinsic crack length”which, when added to the physical crack size, brings short crack data in line with the correspondinglong crack results. The intrinsic crack length is merely a ﬁtting parameter, however, and does notcorrespond to a physical length scale in the material. Tanaka [7], among others, proposed adjustingthe data for crack-tip plasticity by characterizing da/dN with ∆ J rather than ∆K.
According to the closure argument, short cracks exhibit different crack closure behavior than
long cracks, and data for different crack sizes can be rationalized through ∆K
eff. Figure 10.39(a)
[47] shows Kop measurements for the short and long crack data in Figure 10.38. The closure loads
are signiﬁcantly higher in the long cracks, particularly at low ∆K levels. Figure 10.39(b) shows the
small and large crack data lie on a common curve when da/dN is plotted against ∆Keff, thereby
lending credibility to the closure theory of short crack behavior.
10.7 MICROMECHANISMS OF F ATIGUE
Figure 10.40 summarizes the failure mechanisms for metals in the three regions of the fatigue crackgrowth curve. In Region II, where da/dN follows a power law, the crack growth rate is relatively
insensitive to microstructure and tensile properties, while da/dN at either extreme of the curve is
highly sensitive to these variables. The fatigue mechanisms in each region are described in moredetail in the following sections.
10.7.1 F ATIGUE  IN REGION  II
In Region II, the fatigue crack growth rate is not a strong function of microstructure or monotonicﬂow properties. Two aluminum alloys with vastly different mechanical properties, for instance, are1656_C010.fm  Page 491  Monday, May 23, 2005  6:02 PM
492 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
likely to have very similar fatigue crack growth characteristics. Steel and aluminum, however,
exhibit signiﬁcantly different fatigue behavior. Thus, da/dN is not sensitive to microstructure and
tensile properties within a given material system .
One explanation for the lack of sensitivity to metallurgical variables is that cyclic  ﬂow prop-
erties, rather than monotonic tensile properties, control fatigue crack propagation. Figure 10.41schematically compares monotonic and cyclic stress-strain behavior for two alloys of a givenFIGURE 10.40 Micromechanisms of fatigue in metals.

material. The low strength alloy tends to strain harden, while the strong alloy tends to strain soften
with cyclic loading. In both cases, the cyclic stress-strain curve tends toward a steady-state hysteresis
loop, which is relatively insensitive to the initial strength level.
Propagating fatigue cracks often produce striations  on the fracture surface. Striations are
small ridges that are perpendicular to the direction of crack propagation. Figure 10.42 illustratesone proposed mechanism for striation formation during fatigue crack growth [50]. The cracktip blunts as the load increases, and an increment of growth occurs as a result of the formationof a stretch zone. Local slip is concentrated at ±45° from the crack plane. When the load
decreases, the direction of slip reverses, and the crack tip folds inward. The process is repeatedwith subsequent cycles, and each cycle produces a striation on the upper and lower crackFIGURE 10.42 The crack-blunting mechanism for striation formation during fatigue crack growth. Taken

faces. The striation spacing, according to this mechanism, is equal to the crack growth per
cycle ( da/dN).
An alternative view of fatigue is the damage accumulation mechanism, which states that a
number of cycles are required to produce a critical amount of damage, at which time the crackgrows a small increment [51]. This mechanism was supported by Lankford and Davidson [52],who observed that the striation spacing did not necessarily correspond to crack growth after onecycle. Several cycles may be required to produce one striation, depending on the ∆K level; the
number of cycles per striation apparently decreases with increasing ∆K, and striation spacing
= da/dN at high ∆K values.
A number of researchers have attempted to relate the observed crack growth rate to the
micromechanism of fatigue, with limited success. The blunting mechanism, where crack advanceoccurs through the formation of a stretch zone, implies that the crack growth per cycle is proportionalto ∆CTOD. This, in turn, implies that da/dN should be proportional to ∆K
2. Actual Paris law
exponents, however, are typically between three and four for metals. One possible explanation forthis discrepancy is that the blunting mechanism is incorrect. An alternate explanation for exponentsgreater than 2 is that the shape of the blunted crack is not geometrically similar at high and lowK values [7]. Figure 10.43 [7] shows the crack-opening proﬁle for copper at two load levels. Notethat the shapes of the blunted cracks are different.
10.7.2 M ICROMECHANISMS  NEAR THE THRESHOLD
The fracture surface that results from fatigue near the threshold has a ﬂat, faceted appearance thatresembles cleavage [53]. The crack apparently follows speciﬁc crystallographic planes, and changesdirections when it encounters a barrier such as a grain boundary.
The fatigue crack growth rate in this region is sensitive to grain size, in part because coarse-
grained microstructures produce rough surfaces and roughness-induced closure (Figure 10.5).Grain size can also affect the intrinsic  threshold in certain cases. One model for ∆K
th* [34] states
that the threshold occurs when grain boundaries block slip bands and prevent them from propa-gating into the adjoining grain. This apparently happens when the plastic zone size is approximatelyFIGURE 10.43 Crack-opening proﬁle in copper. Taken from Tanaka, K., “Mechanics and Micromechanics
of Fatigue Crack Propagation.” ASTM STP 1020, American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia,

equal to the average grain diameter, which suggests the following relationship between ∆Kth*and
grain size:
(10.39)
where d is the average grain diameter and A is a constant. Thus, the intrinsic threshold increases
with grain size, assuming sYS is constant. The Hall-Petch relationship, however, predicts that yield
strength decreases with grain coarsening:
(10.40)
Consequently, the grain size dependence of yield strength offsets the tendency for the intrinsic
threshold to increase with grain coarsening.
10.7.3 F ATIGUE  AT HIGH ∆K VALUES
In Region III, there is an apparent acceleration in da/dN. In some instances, this may be due to an
interaction between fatigue and fracture mechanisms. Fracture surfaces in this region may includea mixture of fatigue striations, microvoid coalescence, and (depending on the material and thetemperature) cleavage facets. The overall growth rate can be estimated by summing the effects ofthe various mechanisms:
(10.41)
where the subscript MVC refers to microvoid coalescence (Chapter 5). The relative contributionof fatigue decreases with increasing K
max. At Kc, crack growth is completely dominated by microvoid
coalescence, cleavage, or both.
An alternative explanation for the apparent upswing in the crack growth rate at high ∆K values
involves plasticity effects. If the plastic zone produced at Kmax comprises a signiﬁcant fraction of
the remaining ligament, the stress-intensity factor (computed from linear elastic relationships) isan underestimate of the true crack driving force. If an appropriate plasticity correction were appliedto ∆K, the Paris power law would extend to higher load levels.
The dominant mechanism in Region III probably depends on material properties. One would expect
the superimposed fracture/fatigue phenomenon to occur in low-toughness materials. The plasticitymechanism would dominate in tough materials, where signiﬁcant plastic ﬂow precedes fracture.
In any event, the crack growth behavior in Region III is of little practical importance in most
instances. Typical fatigue failures involve the growth of a small initial ﬂaw to a critical size. Insuch cases, the growing fatigue crack probably spends less than 1% of its life in Region III.
10.8 FA TIGUE CRA CK GRO WTH EXPERIMENTS
The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has published Standard E 647 [54], whichoutlines a test method for fatigue crack growth measurements. This standard, described later,includes a recommended practice for estimating the crack-opening load P
op. However, the standard
admits that its recommended Pop measurement procedure does not necessarily give an accurate
indication of the true ∆Keff in the presence of crack closure. A new proposed procedure for computing
∆Keff is described in Section 10.8.3.dAKth

10.8.1 C RACK GROWTH  RATE AND THRESHOLD  MEASUREMENT
The Standard Test Method for Measur ement of Fatigue Crack Growth Rates , ASTM E 647 [54],
describes how to determine da/dN as a function of ∆K from an experiment. The crack is grown by
cyclic loading, and Kmin, Kmax, and crack length are monitored throughout the test.
The test ﬁxtures and specimen design are essentially identical to those required for fracture
toughness testing, which are described in Chapter 7. The E 647 document allows tests on compact
specimens and middle tension panels (Figure 7.1).
The ASTM standard for fatigue crack growth measurements requires that the behavior of the
specimen be predominantly elastic during the tests. This standard speciﬁes the following require-ment for the uncracked ligament of a compact specimen:
(10.42)
There are no speciﬁc requirements on specimen thickness. This standard is often applied to thinsheet alloys for aerospace applications. The fatigue properties, however, can depend on thickness,so the thickness of the test specimen should match the section thickness of the structure of interest.
All specimens must be fatigue precracked prior to the actual test. The K
max at the end of fatigue
precracking should not exceed the initial Kmax in the fatigue test. Otherwise, retardation effects may
inﬂuence the growth rate.
During the test, the crack length must be measured periodically. Crack length measurement
techniques include optical, compliance, and potential drop methods (see Chapter 7). Accurateoptical crack length measurements require a traveling microscope. One disadvantage of thismethod is that it can only detect growth on the surface. In thick specimens, the crack lengthmeasurements must be corrected for tunneling, which cannot be done until the specimen is brokenopen after the test. Another disadvantage of the optical technique is that the crack lengthmeasurements are usually recorded manually,
12 while the other techniques can be automated.
The unloading compliance technique may involve interrupting the test for each crack lengthmeasurement. If the specimen is statically loaded for a ﬁnite length of time, material in theplastic zone may creep. In an aggressive environment, long hold times may result in environ-mentally assisted cracking or the deposition of an oxide ﬁlm on the crack faces. Consequently,the compliance measurements should be made as quickly as possible. The ASTM standardrequires that hold times be limited to 10 min; it should be possible to perform an unloadingcompliance measurement in less than 1 min. Depending on the instrumentation, it may be possibleto obtain accurate compliance measurements during cyclic loading, thereby eliminating the needto interrupt the test.
The ASTM Standard E 647 outlines two types of fatigue tests: (1) constant load amplitude
tests where  K increases and (2) K-decreasing tests. In the latter case, the load amplitude decreases
during the test to achieve a negative  K gradient. The K-increasing test is suitable for crack growth
rates greater that 10
−8 m/cycle, but is difﬁcult to apply at lower rates because of fatigue precracking
considerations. The K-decreasing procedure is preferable when near-threshold data are required.
In a typical K-decreasing test, either Kmax or the R ratio is held constant while ∆K decreases. These
two approaches usually result in different behavior in the threshold region due to the R ratio effect
on ∆Kth (Section 10.4).
12 It is possible to automate optical crack length measurements with image analysis hardware and software, but most
mechanical testing laboratories do not have this capability.WaK

Fatigue Crack Propagation 497
Because of the potential for history effects when the  K amplitude varies, ASTM E 647 requires
that the normalized  K gradient be computed and reported:
(10.43)
The K-decreasing test is more likely to produce history effects, because prior cycles produce larger
plastic zones, which can retard crack growth. Retardation in a rising  K test is not a signiﬁcant problem,
since the plastic zone produced by a given cycle is slightly larger than that in the previous cycle. A
K-increasing test is not immune to history effects, however; the width of the plastic wake increases
with crack growth, which may result in different closure behavior than in a constant  K amplitude test.
The ASTM standard recommends that the algebraic value of G be greater than −0.08 mm−1 in
a K-decreasing test. If the test is computer controlled, the load can be programmed to decrease
continuously to give the desired  K gradient. Otherwise, the load amplitude can be decreased in
steps, provided the step size is less than 10% of the current ∆P. In either case, the load should be
decreased until the desired crack growth rate is achieved. It is usually not practical to collect databelow da/dN = 10
−10 m/cycle. 
The E 647 standard outlines a procedure for assessing whether or not history effects have
occurred in a K-decreasing test. First, the test is performed at a negative G value until the crack
growth rate reaches the intended value. Then the  K gradient is reversed, and the crack is grown
until the growth rate is well out of the threshold region. The K-decreasing and K-increasing portions
of the test should yield the same da/dN – ∆K curve. This two-step procedure is time consuming,
but it need only be performed once for a given material and  R ratio to ensure that the true threshold
behavior is achieved by subsequent K-decreasing tests.
Figure 10.44 schematically illustrates typical crack length vs. N curves. These curves must be
differentiated to infer da/dN. The ASTM Standard E 647 suggests two alternative numerical methods
to compute the derivatives. A linear differentiation approach is the simplest, but it is subject to scatter.The derivative at a given point on the curve can also be obtained by ﬁtting several neighboring pointsto a quadratic polynomial (i.e., a parabola).
The linear method computes the slope from two neighboring data points: ( a
i, Ni) and ( ai+1, Ni+1).
The crack growth rate for is given by

The incremental polynomial approach involves ﬁtting a quadratic equation to a local region of
the crack length vs. N curve, and solving for the derivative mathematically. A group of (2 n + 1)
neighboring points are selected, where n is typically 1, 2, 3, or 4, and ( ai, Ni) is the middle value
in the (2 n + 1) points. The following equation is ﬁtted to the range :

10.8.2 C LOSURE  MEASUREMENTS
A number of experimental techniques for measurement of closure loads in fatigue have been applied.
Allison [55] has reviewed the existing procedures. A brief summary of the more common techniquesis given below, including the recommended practice in ASTM E 647 [54].
Most measurements of closure conditions are inferred from compliance. Figure 10.45 sche-
matically illustrates the load-displacement behavior of a specimen that exhibits crack closure.The precise opening load is ill-deﬁned because there is often a signiﬁcant range of loads wherethe crack is partially closed. The crack load can be deﬁned by a deviation in linearity in either thefully closed or fully open case ( P
1 and P3, respectively), or by extrapolating the fully closed and
fully open load-displacement curve to the point of intersection ( P2). See Section 10.8.3 for a
deﬁnition of Pop that is intended to give a true indication of ∆Keff.

Figure 10.46 illustrates the required instrumentation for the three most common compliance
techniques for closure measurements. The closure load can be inferred from clip gage displace-
ment at the crack mouth, back-face strain measurements, or laser interferometry applied to surfaceindentations. Specimen alignment is critical when inferring closure loads from compliancemeasurements.
Displacement measurements remote from the crack tip often lack sensitivity, which can result
in scatter in compliance estimates. A signal-processing technique called compliance offset  can
enhance sensitivity of global displacement measurements. This is the technique that ASTM E 647recommends for the measurement of P
op. A baseline compliance is inferred from the fully open
portion of the load-displacement curve, and the measured compliance is compared with thisbaseline. The compliance offset is deﬁned as follows:
(10.47)
where C
o is the open-crack compliance. Figure 10.47 schematically illustrates a plot of load vs.
compliance offset. The ASTM standard recommends estimating opening loads corresponding to1%, 2%, and 4% compliance offset.
Interferometric techniques provide a local measurement of crack closure [56]. Monochromatic
light from a laser is scattered off of two indentations on either side of the crack. The two scatteredbeams interfere constructively and destructively, resulting in fringe patterns. The fringes change asthe indentations move apart.
Crack closure is a three-dimensional phenomenon. The interior of a specimen exhibits
different closure behavior than the surface. The clip gage and back-face strain gage methodsprovide a thickness-average measure of closure, while laser interferometry is strictly a surfacemeasurement.
More elaborate experimental techniques are available to study three-dimensional effects. For
example, optical interferometry [57] has been applied to transparent polymers to infer closurebehavior through the thickness. Fleck [58] has developed a special gage to measure crack-openingdisplacements at the interior of a specimen.FIGURE 10.46 Instrumentation for the three most common closure measurement techniques.

10.8.3 A PROPOSED  EXPERIMENTAL  DEFINITION  OF ∆Keff
As was previously discussed, crack closure measurements tend to be highly subjective because
closure is a gradual process that occurs over a ﬁnite load range (Figure 10.45). The important pointto keep in mind is that closure is of practical concern because of its effect on fatigue driving force.Therefore, the goal of any closure measurement should be the determination of the true ∆K
eff. A
deﬁnition of Pop that is consistent with this goal is outlined below.
The ﬁrst part of this proposed measurement entails adjusting the clip gage displacement to
correct for the compliance of the notch. A typical laboratory specimen contains a machined notchof ﬁnite width. When the fatigue crack faces are in contact, the notch faces are separated. In suchcases, the slope of the load vs. clip gage displacement curve reﬂects compliance of a notched butuncracked specimen (Figure 10.3). Removing this contribution to compliance should have a ben-eﬁcial effect on the sensitivity of closure measurements. Therefore, let us deﬁne an adjusted clipgage displacement as follows:
where C(a
N) is the compliance of an uncracked specimen with notch depth aN.
The left-hand side of Figure 10.48 is a schematic plot of load vs. adjusted clip gage displacement.
The corresponding plot of KI vs. load is on the right-hand side of Figure 10.48. The part of
the load-displacement curve labeled Region 1 corresponds to the regime where the crack is
fully open and the applied KI is driven by the remotely applied load. In Region 2, the crack is
partially or fully closed, and KI is driven by the displacement of the crack faces. Even when
the fatigue crack is completely closed, the P vs. V* curve may have a ﬁnite slope due to the
compliance of asperities or corrosion products in the crack. The true applied KI at Pmin can be
inferred through the construction that is illustrated in Figure 10.48. The steps in this procedureare as follows:FIGURE 10.47 The compliance offset method. This technique enhances the sensitivity of closure measure-
ments from clip gage displacement.

1. Determine the adjusted clip gage displacement at Pmin.
2. Construct a vertical line at the V*value from Step 1.
3. Extrapolate the load-displacement curve for the fully open condition (Region 1) down
to lower load levels. The opening load Pop is deﬁned at the point where the extrapolated
load-displacement curve for Region 1 intersects the vertical line constructed in Step 2.
4. Compute Kop from Pop using the standard relationship for the test specimen.
As the right-hand side of Figure 10.48 illustrates, the Kop value inferred from the above
procedure corresponds to the actual applied KI at Pmin. That is, Kop is deﬁned in such a way that
(Kmax – Kop) = ∆Keff reﬂects the true driving force for fatigue.
To understand the physical basis of this method, consider the case where closure is due to a
pure wedging mechanism, such as a corrosion product in the crack. Figure 10.6(b) illustrates this
scenario, in which the load-displacement curve in the fully open regime extrapolates to the origin.The above procedure should apply equally well to plasticity-induced closure or mixed conditions,where there is an offset in the load-displacement curve (Figure 10.6(a) and Figure 10.6(c)), but thesimpliﬁed case in Figure 10.6(b) makes the following explanation more straightforward. Supposethat the initial applied load is sufﬁcient that the crack faces are not in contact with the wedge. Inthis case, the applied K
I can be computed from the load using standard formulas. As the load is
gradually removed and the crack faces begin to contact the wedge, the slope of the load-displacementcurve gradually changes. In this case, the true applied K
I is a function of the applied crack opening
rather than the applied load. This would be the case whether the crack is in full contact with thewedge or in partial contact. At P
min, there is a residual crack opening that results in KI = Kop. If we
now remove the wedge, the applied KI = Kmin, which is the stress intensity corresponding to the
applied load Pmin. In order to achieve the condition KI = Kop in the absence of the wedge , the applied
load must be increased to Pop. This higher load is necessary to achieve the same crack opening that
was previously imposed by the wedge.
10.9 DAMA GE TOLERANCE METHODOLOGY
This section describes how to apply fatigue data and growth models to structures, as part of adamage tolerance design scheme. The term damage tolerance  has a variety of meanings, but
normally refers to a design methodology in which fracture mechanics analyses predict remainingFIGURE 10.48 Proposed deﬁnition of Pop, designed to give a true indication of ∆Keff.

502 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
life, and quantify inspection intervals. This approach is usually applied to structures that are
susceptible to time-dependent ﬂaw growth (e.g., fatigue, environmental-assisted cracking, creepcrack growth). As its name suggests, the damage tolerance philosophy allows ﬂaws to remain inthe structure, provided they are well below the critical size.
Fracture control procedures vary considerably among various industries; a detailed description
of each available approach is beyond the scope of this book. This section outlines a generic damagetolerance methodology and discusses some of the practical considerations. Although fatigue is theprimary subject of this chapter, the approaches described below can, in principle, be applied to alltypes of time-dependent crack growth.
One of the ﬁrst tasks of a damage tolerance analysis is the estimation of the critical ﬂaw size
a
c. Chapter 9 describes approaches for computing critical crack size. Depending on material
properties, ultimate failure may be governed by fracture or plastic collapse. Consequently, an elastic-plastic fracture mechanics analysis that includes the extremes of brittle fracture and collapse asspecial cases is preferable. The possibility of geometric instabilities, such as buckling, should alsobe considered.
Once the critical crack size has been estimated, a safety factor is normally applied to determine
the tolerable  ﬂaw size a
t. The safety factor is often chosen arbitrarily, but a more rational deﬁnition
should be based on uncertainties in the input parameters (e.g., stress and toughness) in the fractureanalysis. Another consideration in specifying the tolerable ﬂaw size is the crack growth rate; a
t
should be chosen such that da/dt at this ﬂaw size is relatively small, and a reasonable length of
time is required to grow the ﬂaw from at to ac.
Fracture mechanics analysis is closely tied to nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in fracture
control procedures. The NDE provides input to the fracture analysis, which in turn helps to deﬁneinspection intervals. A structure is inspected at the beginning of its life to determine the size ofinitial ﬂaws. If no signiﬁcant ﬂaws are detected, the initial ﬂaw size is set at an assumed value a
o,
which corresponds to the largest ﬂaw that might be missed  by NDE. This ﬂaw size should not be
confused with the NDE detectability limit, which is the smallest ﬂaw that can be detected  by the
NDE technique (on a good day). In most cases, ao is signiﬁcantly larger than the detectability limit,
due to the variability in operating conditions and the skill of the operator.
Figure 10.49(a) illustrates the procedure for determining the ﬁrst inspection interval in the
structure. The lower curve deﬁnes the “true” behavior of the worst ﬂaw in the structure, whilethe predicted curve assumes the initial ﬂaw size is a
o. The time required to grow the ﬂaw from
ao to at (the tolerable ﬂaw size) is computed. The ﬁrst inspection interval I1 should be less than
this time, in order to preclude ﬂaw growth beyond at before the next inspection. If no ﬂaws
greater than ao are detected, the second inspection interval I2 is equal to I1, as Figure 10.49(b)
illustrates. Suppose that the next inspection reveals a ﬂaw of length a1, which is larger than ao.
In this instance, a ﬂaw growth analysis must be performed to estimate the time required to growfrom a
1 to at. The next inspection interval I3 might be shorter than I2, as Figure 10.49(c) illustrates.
Inspection intervals would then become progressively shorter as the structure approaches the endof its life. The structure is repaired or taken out of service when the ﬂaw size reaches themaximum tolerable size, or when required inspections become too frequent to justify continuedoperation.
In many applications, a variable inspection interval is not practical; inspections must be often
carried out at regular times that can be scheduled well in advance. In such instances a variation ofthe above approach is required. The main purpose of any damage tolerance assessment is to ensurethat ﬂaws will not grow to failure between inspections. The precise methods for achieving this goaldepend on practical circumstances.
The schematic in Figure 10.49(c) illustrates a ﬂaw growth analysis that is conservative. If
retardation effects are not taken into account, the analysis will be considerably simpler and willtend to overestimate growth rates. If a more detailed analysis is applied, a comparison of actualand predicted ﬂaw sizes after each inspection interval can be used to calibrate the analysis.1656_C010.fm  Page 502  Monday, May 23, 2005  6:02 PM

APPENDIX 10: APPLICA TION OF THE J CONT OUR INTEGRAL 
TO CYCLIC LO ADING
A10.1 DEFINITION OF ∆J
Material ahead of a growing fatigue crack experiences cyclic elastic-plastic loading, as Figure A10.1
illustrates. The material deformation can be characterized by the stress range ∆sij and the strain
range ∆eij in a given cycle.
Consider the loading branch of the stress-strain curve, where the stresses and strains have
initial values sij(1) and eij(1), and increase to sij(2) and eij(2). It is possible to deﬁne a J-like integral
as follows [3–6]:
(A10.1)
where Γ deﬁnes the integration path around the crack tip, and ∆Ti and ∆ui are the changes in traction
and displacement between points (1) and (2). The quantity y is analogous to the strain energy
density:
(A10.2)
Note that y represents the stress work per unit volume performed during loading, rather than the
stress work in a complete cycle. The latter corresponds to the area inside the hysteresis loop(Figure A10.1). For the special case where , ∆J = J. Thus ∆J is merely a generalization
of the J integral, in which the origin is not necessarily at zero stress and strain.
Although ∆J is normally deﬁned from the loading branch of the cyclic stress-strain curve,
it is also possible to deﬁne a ∆J from the unloading branch. The two deﬁnitions coincide if the
cyclic stress-strain curve forms a closed loop, and the loading and unloading branches aresymmetric.
Just as it is possible to estimate J experimentally from a load-displacement curve (Chapter 3
and Chapter 7), ∆J can be inferred from the cyclic load-displacement behavior. Consider a specimen

and Pmax and the load-line displacements Vmin and Vmax, as Figure A10.2(a) illustrates.13 The ∆J can
be computed from an equation of the form:

506 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Because the ∆J parameter is often applied to crack growth under large-scale yielding conditions,
plasticity induced closure often has a signiﬁcant effect on the results. If the crack is closed below
Pcl and Vcl (Figure 10.2(b)), Equation (A10.3) can be modiﬁed as follows:14
(A10.4)
A10.2 PATH INDEPENDENCE OF ∆J
If y exhibits the properties of a potential, the stresses can be derived by differentiating y with
respect to the strains:
(A10.5)
The validity of Equation (A10.5) is both necessary and sufﬁcient for path independence of ∆J. The
proof of path independence is essentially identical to the analysis in Appendix 3.2, except thatstresses, strains, and displacements are replaced by the changes in these quantities from states (1)
to (2). Evaluating ∆J along a closed contour Γ
* (Figure A3.2) and invoking Green’s theorem gives
(A10.6)
where A*is the area enclosed by Γ*. By assuming y displays the properties of a potential
(Equation (A10.5)), the ﬁrst term in the integrand can be written as
(A10.7)
By invoking the strain-displacement relationships for small strains, it can be shown thatEquation (A10.7) is equal to the absolute value of the second term in the integrand in Equation(A10.6). (See Equation (A3.16) to Equation (A3.18) for the mathematical details.) Thus ∆J
* = 0
for any closed contour. Path independence of ∆J evaluated along a crack-tip integral can thus be
readily demonstrated by considering the contour illustrated in Figure A3.3, and noting that  J1 = −J2.
The validity of Equation (A10.5) is crucial in demonstrating path independence of ∆J. This
relationship is automatically satisﬁed when there is proportional loading on each branch of thecyclic stress-strain curves. That is, ∆s
ij must increase (or decrease) in proportion to ∆skl, and the
shapes of the ∆sij−∆ eij hysteresis loops must be similar to one another.
Proportional loading also implies a single-parameter characterization of crack-tip conditions.
Consequently, ∆J uniquely deﬁnes the changes in stress and strain near the crack tip when there
is proportional loading in this region.
In the case of monotonic loading, the J integral ceases to provide a single-parameter description
of crack-tip conditions when there is excessive plastic ﬂow or crack growth (Section 3.6). Similarly,one would not expect ∆J to characterize fatigue crack growth beyond a certain level of plastic
deformation. The limitations of ∆J have yet to be established.
14 The global displacement at closure Vcl, is not necessarily zero. The crack-tip region may be closed, while the crack mouth
is open. Thus, Vcl is often positive.∆JBbPP d Veff cl

A10.3 SMALL-SCALE YIELDING LIMIT
When the cyclic plastic zone is small compared to specimen dimensions, ∆J should characterize
fatigue crack growth, since it is related to ∆K. The precise relationship between ∆K and ∆ J under
small-scale yielding conditions can be inferred by evaluating Equation (A10.1) along a contour in
the elastic singularity dominated zone. For a given ∆KI, the changes in the stresses, strains, and
displacements are given by
(A10.8a)
(A10.8a)
(A10.8c)
where fij and hij are given in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2, and gij can be inferred from Hooke’s law or
the strain-displacement relationships.
Inserting Equation (A10.8a) to Equation (A10.8c) into Equation (A10.1) and evaluating J along
a circular contour of radius r leads to
(A10.9)
where E′ = E for plane stress conditions and E′ = E/(1 − n2) for plane strain. Note that although
∆K = (Kmax − Kmin), ∆J ≠ (Jmax − Jmin), since

Environmentally Assisted 
Cracking in Metals 
Environmentally assisted cracking (EAC) is a common problem in a variety of industries. In the
petroleum industry, for example, EAC is pervasive. Offshore platforms are susceptible to corrosion-assisted fatigue. Equipment in reﬁneries and petrochemical plants are exposed to a myriad of aggres-sive environments that lead to stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement. Similar problemsexist in other settings, including fossil and nuclear power plants, pulp and paper plants, ships, bridges,and aircrafts. Environmental cracking can occur even when there are no visible signs of corrosion.
The published literature is full of experimental data, as well as theoretical models that attempt to
explain environmental cracking phenomena. There is no shortage of controversy in the environmentalcracking literature. It is not unusual to ﬁnd two articles that present data or models that directlycontradict one another.
This chapter presents an overview of a highly complex subject. The focus is on aspects of envi-
ronmental cracking that are relevant to a fracture mechanics specialist. Basic principles of corrosionand electrochemistry are summarized, and the various mechanisms for environmental cracking areintroduced, but detailed discussions on theoretical models are avoided. For readers who desire a morein-depth understanding of this subject, a number of excellent books and reviews have been publishedin the past two decades [1–5].

EACTIONS 
All corrosion processes involve electrochemical reactions. Figure 11.1 illustrates a simple elec-
trochemical cell. The  
anode 
 and  
cathode 
 are physically connected to one another and are immersed
in a conductive medium called an  
electrolyte 
. 
1 
 Atoms from the anode material give up electrons,
resulting in ions being released into the electrolyte and electrons ﬂowing to the cathode. Notethat the corrosion cell forms an electrical circuit. There is a voltage drop,  
∆ 
E 
, between the anode
and cathode. Over time, the anode is consumed (i.e., corrodes), as it releases ions into theelectrolyte.
In cases where the two electrodes in an electrochemical cell are different metals, the anode is the
metal that has a higher propensity to give up electrons (oxidize). For example, in an electrochemicalcell with gold and iron electrodes, iron would be the anode because it oxidizes more readily than gold.Such a conﬁguration is an example of  
galvanic coupling 
.
If an external power source is applied to an electrochemical cell, the ﬂow of electric current can
be reversed, such that the anode becomes the cathode and vice versa. This approach is used inelectroplating. External power sources can also be used as a form of  
cathodic protection 
, as discussed
in Section 11.1.4.
An electrochemical cell need not include a bond between dissimilar metals. A single metal in
contact with an electrolyte may be sufﬁcient to form a corrosion cell, depending on the respective

chemical compositions of the metal and electrolyte. For example, consider a coupon of iron
immersed in hydrochloric acid (HCl). The chemical reaction is
(11.1)
The iron is consumed by this reaction and hydrogen gas (H 
2 
) is generated. If we consider only the
interaction between iron and hydrogen, the above reaction can be written in the following form:
(11.2)
Therefore, iron reacts with hydrogen ions to form iron ions, atomic hydrogen, and hydrogen gas.This reaction can be divided into two parts:
(11.3a)
(11.3b)
Iron is  
oxidized 
 to iron ions and hydrogen ions are  
reduced  
to H atoms that can either be absorbed
by the electrode or recombine and evolve into the electrolyte as hydrogen gas.

 The former is an
anodic reaction and the latter is a cathodic reaction. An oxidizing or anodic reaction involves theproduction of electrons, while the consumption of electrons indicates a reducing or cathodic reaction.

The former scenario, where atomic hydrogen is absorbed into the electrode, can lead to hydrogen embrittlement, as
discussed in Section 11.4.

Figure 11.2 schematically illustrates the anodic and cathodic reactions involved in the corrosion
of iron by hydrochloric acid. In this particular case, both the anodic and cathodic reactions occur
at the same physical location. In other instances, such as a galvanic cell or cathodic protection, theanode and cathode reactions can occur at different locations. However, irrespective of the preciseconﬁguration of the electrochemical cell and relative locations of the anodic and cathodic reactions, 
both reactions must occur simultaneously and at the same r ate 
.
Every corrosion process consists of an anodic and cathodic reaction. The anodic reaction
normally involves the oxidation of a metal to its ion. The general form for the anodic reaction isgiven by
(11.4)
where  
n 
 is the number of electrons produced, which equals the valence of the ion. Most metallic
corrosion processes involve one or more of the cathodic (reduction) reactions listed below [1].

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Nearly all corrosion problems can be explained in terms of the above reactions. For example,
consider the corrosion of steel (which, of course, is predominately iron) immersed in water that is
exposed to the atmosphere. The anodic reaction in this case is Equation (11.3a). Since water isnearly neutral and is aerated, the cathodic reaction is Equation (11.7). The overall reaction can beinferred by adding Equation (11.3a) and Equation (11.7):
(11.10)
Ferrous hydroxide, which is the product of the above reaction, is unstable in oxygenated water. Itoxidizes to ferric hydroxide, which is known to the layperson as rust:
(11.11)
Note that both water and oxygen are required to corrode steel. Steel that is completely submerged
in water normally corrodes very slowly because the cathodic reaction is starved for oxygen. Steelcorrodes most quickly when there is an ample supply of both moisture and oxygen, such as in aclimate with high relative humidity and frequent rain showers. The corrosion rate is also accelerated ifsteel is coupled galvanically to a more noble metal.
Consider a steel structure in a seawater environment, such as an offshore platform. The most
aggressive environments occur just above and below the water surface. In the splash zone abovethe surface, both oxygen and water are plentiful. Within the ﬁrst few feet below the surface, thewater is oxygen rich because wave motion traps air bubbles. This relatively simple situation iscomplicated by tight crevice geometries (Section 11.2.2), the presence of additional dissolved ionsin the electrolyte, and the imposed cathodic protection (Section 11.1.4).

OLARIZATION 
Since corrosion is an electrochemical process, the magnitude of the electric current in the corrosioncell is a fundamental measure of the corrosion rate. As stated earlier, both the anodic and cathodicreactions occur simultaneously and at the same rate. The corrosion current can be reduced byinhibiting either reaction, or by reducing the conductivity of the electrolyte.
When an electrochemical reaction is retarded by one or more environmental factors, it is said
to be  
polarized 
. There are three types of polarization:  
activation polarization, 
  
concentration polar-
ization 
, and  
resistance polarization 
. Activation polarization refers to processes that are controlled
by the rate of the reaction at the metal-electrolyte interface. Concentration polarization occurs whenthe rate-limiting step is diffusion of ions in the electrolyte. Resistance polarization is a consequenceof the resistivity of the electrolyte. A reaction can also be polarized by an externally applied current(galvanostatic polarization) or potential (potentiostatic polarization).
Resistance polarization is a major factor in the corrosiveness of seawater compared to tap water
and de-ionized water. Seawater is very conductive because there is an ample supply of sodium andchloride ions, while de-ionized water has relatively low electrical conductivity. Normal tap waterfalls somewhere between these extremes.

A key factor that controls the corrosion current is the  
electrode potential 
. Recall the simple corrosion
cell in Figure 11.1, which showed an electric potential drop ( 
∆ 
E 
) between the anode and cathode.
The electrode potential refers to the half-cell potential of the electrode. It is deﬁned as the potentialdifference between the electrode of interest and a reference electrode, such as a standard hydrogenelectrode (SHE). The magnitude of the electrode potential is a function of the chemical compositionof the electrode and the oxidizing power of the electrolyte. The oxidizing power is a function ofthe reagents that are present as well as their concentration.22 2 4 2222

Normally, the corrosion current increases exponentially with increasing electrode potential.
However, many technologically important materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, and titanium alloys)
exhibit a more complex behavior called  
passivity 
.
Figure 11.3 illustrates the typical behavior of a metal that exhibits passivity effects. There are
three distinct regimes: active, passive, and transpassive. In the active region, a small increase inelectrode potential causes a large increase in corrosion rate. A plot of electrode potential vs. thelogarithm of current density is a straight line in the active region. As electrode potential is increasedfurther by any of the polarization processes described in Section 11.1.2, the current density exhibitsa sudden decrease at the beginning of the passive region. The corrosion rate in the passive regionis typically 3 to 6 orders of magnitude slower than one would predict by extrapolating the trendin the active region. In the passive region, a surface ﬁlm that acts as a protective barrier forms onthe surface. This surface ﬁlm remains stable over a wide range of electrode potential. The surfaceﬁlm breaks down in the transpassive region due to the presence of very powerful oxidizers. Thehighly protective surface ﬁlms are very thin, perhaps tens of nanometers. Such ﬁlms are easilydamaged by mechanical means, but quickly reform to protect the metal from corrosion.

ATHODIC

ROTECTION 
Cathodic protection entails suppressing corrosion by reversing the direction of electric current. Inthe absence of such protection, corrosion occurs when current passes from the metal surface to theelectrolyte and the rate of the anodic (dissolution) reaction is high. Therefore, the corrosion reactioncan be suppressed if current enters the metal from the electrolyte. One can view cathodic protectionas supplying electrons to the metal surface that is to be protected. As a result, one or more of thecathodic reactions are stimulated on the metal surface in place of the anodic reaction.
Cathodic protection can be achieved either through an external power source or appropriate
galvanic coupling. In the former case, the external power source imposes an electric current in theopposite direction of the naturally occurring electrochemical reaction. The galvanic couplingmethod entails the use of a sacriﬁcial anode, which corrodes instead of the protected material.

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
The sacriﬁcial anode must oxidize more readily than the protected material, and it must be electrically
connected to the protected material. Typical materials for sacriﬁcial anodes include magnesium,zinc, and aluminum-tin alloys.
It is important to understand the active environmental degradation mechanism in a given
application before applying a remediation technique such as cathodic protection. This is particularlytrue for environmental cracking. Cathodic protection can be an effective means to prevent or minimizegeneral corrosion or stress corrosion cracking, but it can actually exacerbate cracking due tohydrogen embrittlement.

ORROSION 
Corrosion can manifest itself in a number of forms, and there are generally accepted categories ofcorrosion based on the appearance and electrochemical processes. The types of corrosion include(but are not limited to):
• Uniform attack
• Galvanic (two-metal) corrosion• Crevice corrosion• Pitting• Intergranular corrosion• Erosion corrosion
• Environmental cracking
The last item is, of course, the subject of this chapter and is considered in detail. Within the contextof the present chapter, the other forms of corrosion are relevant to the extent that they inﬂuenceenvironmental cracking. For example, corrosion pits and crevices often act as crack nucleationsites. Not only do such surface features concentrate stress, they also provide a chemical concen-tration, as discussed in Section 11.2.2. Uniform corrosion is of less concern from the standpointof crack initiation, but can inﬂuence crack propagation. For example, if the cracking is driven bya cathodic reaction at the crack tip (i.e., hydrogen embrittlement) a corresponding anodic reactionon the surface outside of the crack can play a role. 
11.2 ENVIRONMENTAL CRACKING OVERVIEW 
Section 11.3 to Section 11.5 go into detail about speciﬁc types of environmental cracking. There are,however, certain observations one can make about environmental cracking that are not speciﬁc to oneparticular mechanism. Some of these more general phenomena, such as occluded chemistry, thresholdstress intensity, ﬂuctuating vs. static loads, and crack morphology, are discussed in this section. Thesediscussions are preceded by brief descriptions of the four types of environmental cracking.

The terminology of environmental cracking varies in the published literature. This chapter adoptsthe most common nomenclature. The term  
environmentally assisted cracking 
 (EAC) is meant to
be generic, as it refers to all cracking in metals that is aided by a chemical environment. There arefour recognized types of EAC.
• Stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
• Hydrogen embrittlement (HE)• Corrosion fatigue (CF)
• Liquid metal embrittlement (LME)

SCC refers to crack propagation that is driven by an anodic corrosion reaction at the crack tip.
In the past, the term  
stress corrosion cracking 
 was used to refer to a broad range of environmental
cracking mechanisms, but this chapter adopts the more recent and more restrictive deﬁnition of
SCC. Section 11.3 describes SCC in more detail.
HE involves the loss of a metal’s bond strength due to the presence of atomic hydrogen at grain
boundaries and interstitial sites in the crystal lattice. Of particular interest in the present contextare situations where the presence of atomic hydrogen leads to crack propagation. In many of theseinstances, an electrochemical corrosion reaction acts as a hydrogen source at the crack tip. Whatdistinguishes hydrogen embrittlement cracking from stress corrosion cracking is that the  
cathodic 
reaction drives crack propagation in the former. Section 11.4 covers HE in greater detail.
This chapter separates environmental cracking mechanisms into anodic (SCC) and cathodic
(HE) processes for the sake of simplicity and convenience. In reality, the distinction between anodic-and cathodic-driven crack growth is not always clear. For example, there are cases where environ-mental cracking initiates through an anodic process but propagates as a result of cathodic hydrogenproduction. Alternatively, both anodic and cathodic reactions can occur near the crack tip, withboth contributing to propagation.
CF is deﬁned as the acceleration of fatigue failure in a chemical environment compared to the
fatigue life in an inert environment. Damage results from a synergistic interaction between plasticdeformation and electrochemical reactions at the crack tip. See Section 11.5 for a more detaileddiscussion of CF.
LME or  
liquid metal cracking 
 normally does not involve an electrochemical corrosion reaction.
Cracking occurs when liquid metal penetrates grain boundaries of another metal that (obviously)is in a solid state. Several alloy systems are susceptible to LME, including aluminum, titanium,stainless steel, and nickel-based alloys. Metals with low melting points, such as lead, mercury, andzinc, tend to be the materials that cause cracking in certain situations. One of the more commonoccurrences of liquid metal cracking involves contamination of austenitic stainless steel by zinc.Such contamination normally occurs as a result of contact between galvanized parts and the stainlesssteel at elevated temperatures.

Shielded areas such as cracks, corrosion pits, and crevices often experience different corrosionbehavior than the surrounding material because of restricted mass transport between the bulk andlocal environments. The phenomenon of  
crevice corrosion 
 refers to preferential attack associated
with small volumes of stagnant solutions at holes, lap joints, gasket surfaces, and under bolt andrivet heads. The different corrosion behavior at shielded or  
occluded 
 areas is a very important factor
in nearly all forms of environmental cracking.
Figure 11.4 schematically illustrates a corrosion pit and a crack exposed to an electrolyte.
Electrochemical reactions in these occluded volumes result in a different local chemistry, whichinﬂuences subsequent reactions. At corrosion pits, the occluded chemistry at the bottom of the pitcan lead to initiation of environmental cracks. The occluded chemistry at the tip of an environmentalcrack often has a signiﬁcant effect on the propagation rate.
To illustrate the electrochemical processes that lead to occluded chemistry, consider a steel
component with a surface crack exposed to aerated seawater. Assuming the seawater is neutral (pH 7),the overall reaction consists of the dissolution of iron (Equation (11.3(a))) and the reduction ofoxygen to hydroxide ions (Equation (11.7)). Charge conservation is maintained in both the steeland the water. Each electron that is produced during the oxidation of iron is immediately consumedby the oxygen reduction reaction. Over time, oxygen in the crack is depleted, and the oxygenreduction reaction ceases. However, the oxidation of iron continues, which results in an excess ofpositive iron ions. In order to maintain charge balance, chloride ions migrate into the crack. Theiron and chloride ions react with water to form ferric hydroxide hydrogen ions in the form of

hydrochloric acid. A crack or crevice exposed to a neutral dilute sodium chloride solution may
contain as much as 10 times the bulk concentration of chlorine and have a pH in the range of 2 to 3.
The occluded crack-tip chemistry can accelerate both anodic stress-corrosion cracking and
hydrogen-embrittlement cracking. In the former case, the local acidic and chloride-rich solutiontends to be more aggressive than the bulk environment. In the case of hydrogen embrittlement,occluded environments aid the production of hydrogen, which is then absorbed into the metal atthe crack tip.

As is the case with fatigue (Chapter 10), environmental cracking is subcritical and time dependent.Moreover, fracture mechanics similitude can be applied to the crack growth rate. That is, equal crackgrowth rates are observed for equal applied stress-intensity values. In the case of corrosion fatigue, thestress-intensity range  
∆ 
K 
 is the main characterizing parameter as it is with fatigue in inert environments
(Chapter 10). For static loading, the crack growth rate  
da 
/ 
dt 
 can be correlated to the applied  
K 
.
Figure 11.5 illustrates typical environmental crack growth behavior for static loading. In Stage I,
the crack growth rate  
da 
/ 
dt 
 is highly sensitive to the applied  
K 
. One can deﬁne a threshold stress
intensity  
K 
IEAC 
, below which the anticipated crack growth is negligible. The threshold concept is
discussed further in Section 11.2.4. In Stage II, there are two types of behavior that have beenobserved. With Type A behavior (Figure 11.5(a)), the crack growth rate is insensitive to the applied 
K 
 in Stage II. With Type B behavior (Figure 11.5(b)), the crack growth increases with the applied 
K 
 in Stage II, but the slope of the log( 
da 
/ 
dt 
) vs.  
K 
 curve is much lower than in Stage I. Stage III
corresponds to ﬁnal fracture when the applied K reaches the fracture toughness of the material.
Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7 show examples of Type A and Type B environmental cracking
behavior, respectively. Figure 11.6 is a plot of environmental cracking data for an aluminum alloyin a saturated salt water solution [6]. Figure 11.7 shows data for hydrogen-embrittlement crackingin a high strength steel [7]. Type A behavior, where there is a plateau in Stage II, is more commonthan Type B behavior.FIGURE 11.4 Occluded environment at the bottom of a pit and the tip of a crack differs from the bulk

11.2.4 T HE THRESHOLD  FOR EAC
The concept of a threshold stress intensity for environmental cracking KIEAC has been a subject
of considerable debate over the years. When fracture mechanics was ﬁrst applied to environmental
cracking problems, many viewed KIEAC as a unique property that applied to a particular combi-
nation of material and environment. More recently, environmental cracking experts have becomeskeptical about the existence of a true threshold stress intensity. When conducting environmentalcracking experiments, the apparent threshold tends to decrease as the duration of the testincreases. Some experts have gone so far as to argue that the true threshold is zero. They believe
that the apparent  threshold, as measured in an experiment, will decrease indeﬁnitely as the time
of exposure increases.
Since it is not possible to run an experiment of inﬁnite duration, we may never obtain scientiﬁc
proof of the existence or absence of a true threshold for environmental cracking. While this may bean interesting issue for theoreticians, it is of little practical signiﬁcance to engineers because theyusually need not be concerned with environmental cracking that occurs over geologic time scales.
It is important to remember that the crack growth rate is plotted on a logarithmic scale, and
that the Stage I curve tends to be very steep. In fact, the Stage I crack growth curve for hydrogencracking of 4130 steel (Figure 11.7) is almost vertical. In Stage I, the crack growth rate can decreaseby several orders of magnitude with a modest decrease in the applied K. Consequently, it is possible
to establish a practical  threshold for environmental cracking.FIGURE 11.6 Effect of an overaging heat treatment on the stress corrosion cracking behavior of 7079-T651

Figure 11.8 illustrates a procedure to estimate a practical threshold. Crack growth rate data in
Stage I can be used to establish the slope of the vs. K line. This line can then be
extrapolated down to an acceptably low target crack growth rate. For example, suppose that 1 mm
of crack growth in 10 years constitutes insigniﬁcant propagation over the life of the structure. Thiscorresponds to a target growth rate of 3.2 × 10
−12 m/sec. Of course, extrapolation introduces errors
and uncertainties, so it is best to obtain data at the lowest growth rate that is practical, givenexperimental time constraints and instrument sensitivity.
11.2.5 S MALL CRACK EFFECTS
As with fatigue crack propagation (Chapter 10), one must be extremely cautious when applyingthreshold concepts to design. This is especially true for small cracks, where applied K values may
be very low but crack propagation occurs nonetheless.
Figure 11.9 is a schematic plot of the threshold stress for environmental cracking vs. crack
size. A constant K
IEAC for a given material and environment implies that the threshold stress should
vary as (if we neglect the crack size dependence on the geometry factor Y). Such a model
predicts that threshold stress approaches inﬁnity as a → 0. This model obviously cannot be correct
at small crack sizes. Otherwise, environmental cracking would never occur on initially smoothsurfaces. The threshold K model cannot explain crack initiation from smooth surfaces, nor can it
explain propagation of small cracks. In the small crack regime, there are both mechanical andelectrochemical factors that enable crack propagation to occur below the apparent threshold.FIGURE 11.7 Cracking of 4130 steel exposed to gaseous hydrogen. This material–environment combination

Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Metals 523
One mechanical factor that inﬂuences small crack behavior is that the plastic zone size may
be of the same order as the crack size, which invalidates linear elastic fracture mechanics. Even if
plastic zone effects are taken into account in the crack driving force, fracture mechanics similitudemay not apply to crack nucleation and the early stages of growth.
The crack size can inﬂuence the nature and rate of electrochemical reactions. For example,
there are instances where the anode reaction occurs outside of the crack and the cathode reactionoccurs at the crack tip (or vice versa). Since an electrochemical reaction requires transport of ionsand electrons between the anode and the cathode (Figure 11.1) and this ion transport can be therate-controlling step in some instances. This reaction may proceed at a faster rate when there isless distance for ions to travel, such as when the crack is shallow. Moreover, the occluded chemistryat the tip of a short crack may be different from that of a deep crack.
11.2.6 S TATIC, CYCLIC, AND FLUCTUATING  LOADS
Environmental cracking data, such as plotted in Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7, are typically obtainedfrom static tests. As discussed in Section 11.6, most such tests are usually performed in either constantload or constant displacement conditions. In many applications, however, the applied loads ﬂuctuate.Corrosion fatigue experiments can characterize a material in the presence of both cyclic loads and acorrosive environment. In this case, factors such as the frequency of loading and the waveform caninﬂuence the crack growth rate. Refer to Section 11.5 for a more detailed discussion of corrosion fatigue.
There are applications in which loads ﬂuctuate mildly or infrequently. Such situations are not
normally considered corrosion fatigue, because fatigue damage would be negligible in an inertenvironment. However, minor or infrequent load ﬂuctuations can have an effect on the environ-mental cracking rate. Both stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement can be sensitiveto the crack-tip strain rate. During periods where the K is increasing with time  the
material may be more susceptible to crack propagation. As a result, data from static tests mayunderestimate the crack growth rate and overestimate the threshold when . Examples of thisbehavior for hydrogen cracking are discussed in Section 11.4.
11.2.7 C RACKING  MORPHOLOGY
Figure 11.10 illustrates three typical cracking morphologies that can occur through environmentalmeans. Cracking can be either transgranular or intergranular. There may be a single planar crackor a branched network. Branched cracking can be either transgranular or intergranular. The crackingmorphology is a result of the interaction between the material and the environment.
Branched cracking is problematic from an analytical standpoint. There is no practical way to
compute rigorous stress-intensity solutions for severely branched cracks. Even if one decided tomodel such a crack with ﬁnite element analysis or another analytical technique, existing nonde-structive examination (NDE) technology is not capable of providing detailed information about theconﬁguration of a branched network. The good news is that treating branched cracking as a singleplanar crack with the equivalent depth is conservative. Multiple crack tips in a branched networktend to shield one another, resulting in a decrease in the effective crack driving force.
11.2.8 L IFE PREDICTION
In principle, life prediction for EAC can be performed in much the same way as it is for fatigue crackpropagation. For example, suppose that the crack growth rate is a known function of stress intensity:

The time required for a crack to propagate from an initial size to a ﬁnal size can be computed by
integrating the growth law:
(11.13)
In many practical situations, however, accurate life predictions are virtually impossible. Crack-
ing velocities, as well as the threshold, tend to be highly sensitive to environmental and metallurgicalvariables. Published environmental cracking data are available only for a limited number ofenvironment–material combinations. Even when experimental data are available for the materialand environment of interest, life prediction may still be difﬁcult. Laboratory EAC data are typicallyobtained under controlled environmental conditions, while the service environment may ﬂuctuateand be ill-deﬁned.
11.3 STRESS CORROSION CRA CKING
The term stress corrosion cracking  (SCC), as it is used in this chapter, refers to crack propagation
due to an anodic reaction at the crack tip. The crack propagates because the material at the cracktip is consumed by the corrosion reaction. In many cases, SCC occurs when there is little visibleevidence of general corrosion on the metal surface, and is commonly associated with metals thatexhibit substantial passivity.
Figure 11.11 is a simple illustration of SCC. In order for the crack to propagate by this mechanism,
the corrosion rate at the crack tip must be much greater than the corrosion rate at the walls of the crack.If the crack faces and crack tip corrode at similar rates, the crack will blunt. Under conditions that arefavorable to SCC, a passive ﬁlm (usually an oxide) forms on the crack walls. This protective layersuppresses the corrosion reaction on the crack faces. High stresses at the crack tip cause the protectiveﬁlm to rupture locally, which exposes the metal surface to the electrolyte, resulting in crack propagationdue to anodic dissolution. See Section 11.3.1 for further discussion of the ﬁlm rupture model.
Because of the need for a passive layer to form on the crack faces, conditions that favor SCC
often do not favor general corrosion. Figure 11.12 illustrates the typical regions of SCC suscepti-bility on a polarization diagram. Stress corrosion cracking tends to occur in the transition betweenactive and passive behavior, as well as the transition between passive and transpassive behavior.In the latter case, the region of SCC susceptibility coincides with susceptibility to corrosion pitting.Corrosion pits often act as nucleation sites for SCC due to local stress concentration and occludedchemistry effects.
Plots of electrode potential vs. pH, which are called Pourbaix diagrams, can be used to assess
the relative susceptibility to SCC as a function of environmental variables. Figure 11.13 shows the

Pourbaix diagram for iron in water. Low pH levels (i.e., acidic conditions) combined with potentials
above –0.6 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) correspond to regions of active corrosion. Inthis active region, iron will oxidize to Fe
2+ or Fe3+. Consider a potential of −0.2 V and a pH ranging
from 4 to 10, as indicated in Figure 11.13. At the upper end of this range, the oxide is stable andthe iron surface passivates. The low end of this region is in an area of active corrosion. The optimalpH for SCC in this case is 7. At higher pH levels, the oxide ﬁlm becomes stable, and the corrosionrate is very slow due to passivation. At lower pH levels, a passive ﬁlm does not form, and generalcorrosion occurs instead of SCC.
While Pourbaix diagrams may be useful in determining the susceptibility to SCC initiation,
they are often of less value when applied to crack propagation. The occluded environment at thecrack tip normally results in a different potential and pH compared to the bulk environment.Measuring the potential and pH at the crack-tip is not practical in most instances. Ongoingresearch is aimed at developing predictive models that enable the crack-tip environment to beinferred from the bulk environment, and signiﬁcant successes have been recorded over the pasttwo decades.
11.3.1 T HE FILM RUPTURE  MODEL
As Figure 11.11 illustrates, the crack-tip corrosion rate must be much greater than the corrosion rateon the crack faces in order for SCC to occur. One way to establish such a condition is for the cracktip to be exposed to the electrolyte while the crack faces are protected by a passive ﬁlm. Accordingto the ﬁlm rupture model , plastic strain at the crack tip causes the passive ﬁlm to fracture, thereby
exposing fresh metal to the environment. This exposed metal corrodes, resulting in SCC growth.
A number of versions of the ﬁlm rupture model have been proposed [3]. In one version of the
model, the crack tip does not repassivate once the ﬁlm is ruptured, so crack propagation iscontinuous. Figure 11.14 illustrates the continuous cracking model. Figure 11.15 depicts an alternateversion of the ﬁlm rupture model, which states that cracking is discontinuous. Local plasticdeformation at the crack tip exposes fresh metal, which then corrodes to produce an increment ofcrack growth. After a brief period, the crack tip repassivates as the ﬁlm thickens and metaldissolution is mitigated. At a critical combination of ﬁlm thickness and accumulated strain, theprocess repeats itself. Crack arrest marks may be seen on the fracture surface in the case of discontinuouspropagation. There is experimental evidence for both the continuous and discontinuous crackingmechanisms.

528 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The ﬁlm rupture model provides an explanation for Stage I cracking behavior (Figure 11.5),
where crack velocity is highly sensitive to the applied K. In Stage I, the crack growth rate is
controlled by deformation processes at the tip. Below the threshold, there is insufﬁcient plastic
strain at the crack tip to rupture the protective ﬁlm, and crack velocity is negligible. At the onsetof Stage II, there is ample plastic strain for ﬁlm rupture; so chemical factors control the crackingrate, as discussed in the following section.
11.3.2 C RACK GROWTH  RATE IN STAGE II
Most SCC processes exhibit Type A behavior in Stage II (Figure 11.5(a)), where crack velocity isindependent of the applied K. In this regime, the crack growth rate is controlled by chemical factors.
The overall speed of the electrochemical reaction is governed by the rate-controlling step. Severalprocesses must occur simultaneously, and it is the slowest process that governs the corrosion rateand consequently the crack growth rate. The processes that may occur during SCC include:
• Surface reactions
• Reactions in the solution near the crack tip
• Mass transport in the electrolyte, the crack tip, and the bulk environment.
Unlike hydrogen embrittlement (Section 11.4) there are no time-dependent reaction steps or masstransport that occurs ahead of the crack tip in the plastic zone.
11.3.3 M ETALLURGICAL  VARIABLES  THAT INFLUENCE  SCC
There are three main characteristics of a material that inﬂuence its cracking behavior in a givenenvironment:
• Alloy chemistry
• Microstructure
• Strength
Each of these factors is discussed brieﬂy here.FIGURE 11.15 Alternate version of the ﬁlm rupture model, where crack growth is discontinuous.  The crack
tip re-passivates after a small crack advance. Taken from Jones, R.H. (ed.), Stress-Corrosion Cracking:

Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Metals 529
The various elements and compounds that are present in an alloy dictate which electrochemical
reactions can occur. The relative amounts of alloying elements and impurities inﬂuence the rate of
the electrochemical reactions and the stability of various compounds. Variations in alloy chemistrywithin a given material class can modify the polarization and Pourbaix diagrams, which can havea pronounced effect on the environmental cracking behavior at a given potential and pH. Alloycontent can also affect slip morphology, which plays a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁlm rupture process.
Microstructural heterogeneity can result in preferred paths for SCC. For example, intergranular
SCC is normally associated with either grain boundary precipitation or grain boundary segregation.An example of grain boundary precipitation is carbide formation on grain boundaries in austeniticstainless steels, which results in chromium depletion adjacent to the grain boundaries. Grainboundary segregation of impurities such as phosphorous and sulfur can occur as a result of temperembrittlement of alloy steels. Such impurity segregation can produce very thin grain boundary ﬁlmsthat make the material susceptible to intergranular SCC.
The conventional wisdom states that high-strength alloys are more susceptible to SCC than
low-strength alloys. This is by no means a universal rule, however. Much of the experimental datathat have been cited as evidence of a strength effect on environmental cracking actually pertain toa hydrogen embrittlement mechanism rather than anodic SCC. Figure 11.6, for example, shows adramatic increase in K
IEAC with overaging of an initially high strength aluminum alloy. In this
instance, cracking is driven by hydrogen production at the crack tip rather than anodic dissolution.Moreover, it is not clear whether the K
IEAC increase is due to a strength increase or to the micro-
structural changes that accompany overaging.
11.3.4 C ORROSION  PRODUCT  WEDGING
When anodic dissolution occurs inside a crack, the crack can become ﬁlled with a corrosion product,as has been observed in aluminum alloys in moist environments. A similar precipitation can alsooccur in the crack electrolyte under predominately cathodic conditions, such as has been observedin cathodically protected steel in seawater. The volume of this corrosion product, which is usuallyan oxide, can be several times greater than the metal that was consumed in the anodic reaction.The expansion of corrosion product inside a crack can result in applied loading on the crack faces.
Several researchers have proposed corrosion product wedging as a mechanism to drive SCC
[8–11]. While this mechanism has been demonstrated experimentally in a couple of instances, crackpropagation driven by corrosion product wedging does not appear to be widespread. Theoretically,the applied loading due to expanding corrosion product in a crack can lead to signiﬁcant appliedK
I values. On the other hand, the electrochemical conditions under which signiﬁcant corrosion
product is generated in a crack may not be favorable to SCC. That is, the generation of signiﬁcantcorrosion product may be associated with the general corrosion regime, where the crack facescorrode and the crack tip blunts. Another potential mitigating factor is that the corrosion productmay obstruct the electrolyte’s access to the crack tip.
Corrosion product wedging does play a signiﬁcant role in corrosion fatigue, particularly in the
threshold regime. See Section 11.5.4 for a detailed discussion of this mechanism.
11.4 HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT
When atomic hydrogen is introduced into an alloy, the toughness and ductility can be reduceddramatically, and subcritical crack growth can occur. Many engineers and metallurgists think ofhydrogen embrittlement as a mechanism that affects only steel. This perception is due in part tothe fact that steel is a much more common structural material than other alloy systems. Hydrogenembrittlement actually affects most, if not all, important alloy systems, including titanium, alumi-num, nickel-based alloys and, of course, both ferritic and austenitic steel.1656_C011.fm  Page 529  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:27 PM
530 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Hydrogen embrittlement is responsible for much of what has traditionally been referred to as
“stress corrosion cracking.” For example, environmental cracking of high strength steel, aluminum,
and titanium alloys in aqueous solutions is usually driven by hydrogen production at the crack tip(i.e., the cathodic reaction) rather than anodic SCC.
11.4.1 C RACKING  MECHANISMS
Hydrogen atoms are small compared to most metallic atoms such as iron, aluminum, and titanium.As a result, hydrogen atoms can ﬁt within interstitial sites in a metallic crystal, as well as at grainboundaries. Moreover, atomic hydrogen readily diffuses through metals, even at room temperature.
The atomistic mechanism for hydrogen embrittlement has been the subject of much debate
over the years, and several competing models have been proposed. Currently, the majority opinionis that atomic hydrogen reduces the bond strength between metal atoms, thereby making fractureeasier. The reduction in cohesive strength due to the presence of atomic hydrogen can be explainedon theoretical grounds, but there is no direct experimental evidence for this mechanism.
Hydrogen embrittlement can lead to a reduction in fracture toughness as well as subcritical
crack growth. It is the latter that is of interest in this chapter. Hydrogen embrittlement is a verycommon mechanism for EAC.
Gangloff [12] suggests that crack propagation due to hydrogen embrittlement should be divided
into two categories: hydrogen-environment-assisted cracking  (HEAC) and internal-hydrogen-
assisted cracking  (IHAC). Figure 11.16 illustrates both types of cracking. The key difference between
these two designations is the source of the hydrogen.
In both HEAC and IHAC, hydrogen is concentrated at the fracture process zone near the crack tip.
The high degree of stress triaxiality near the crack tip causes the crystal lattice to expand, whichincreases the hydrogen solubility locally. The high local concentration of hydrogen causes theprocess zone to be embrittled. This embrittlement, along with the high local stresses, results inmicrocracking in the process zone. The microcracks that form in the process zone link up with themain crack, resulting in crack extension. The main crack propagates over time, as the local crack-tipprocesses of hydrogen uptake and microcracking occur continuously. The precise location of themicrocrack is controversial, but it is likely somewhere between the crack-tip surface and several
FIGURE 11.16 Environmentally assisted cracking driven by hydrogen embrittlement. Hydrogen-environment-
assisted cracking (HEAC) provides atomic hydrogen to the fracture process zone by means of a surface reaction

Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Metals 531
crack-tip-opening displacements inward. Because of the different sources of hydrogen, microcrack-
ing probably occurs closer to the crack tip for HEAC than it does for IHAC.
HEAC involves hydrogen entering the material at the crack tip. An example of HEAC is when
a material is exposed to H2 gas. Atomic hydrogen is produced at the crack tip when H2 molecules
disassociate. In the absence of a crack under stress, the amount of atomic hydrogen absorbed intothe material is negligible at ambient temperature. However, the triaxial stress at the tip of a crackunder an applied load affects the equilibrium between H
2 and atomic hydrogen. When coupled with
a phenomenon called hydrogen trapping, the local stress ﬁeld results in very high hydrogenconcentrations near the crack tip. Figure 11.16 lists two other sources of hydrogen that can driveHEAC: water vapor and an electrolyte. In the latter case, a corrosion reaction occurs inside thecrack as in anodic SCC, but it is the cathodic  reaction that drives HEAC. Substantial levels of
hydrogen are absorbed on the surface through such electrochemical processes.
IHAC occurs when there is dissolved hydrogen in the material. The solubility of atomic
hydrogen in most materials is very low at ambient temperature but is signiﬁcant at elevatedtemperatures. A material can become hydrogen charged at an elevated temperature when it isexposed to H
2 gas or other compounds that contain hydrogen, such as H2S. Upon cooling to ambient
temperature, atomic hydrogen diffuses out of the material because it is supersaturated. Hydrogenoutgassing takes time, however, particularly in thick sections. Consequently, dissolved hydrogencan remain in the material for a signiﬁcant period of time. When a hydrogen-charged materialcontains a crack under stress, dissolved hydrogen diffuses into the fracture process zone, asFigure 11.16 illustrates. The concentration of hydrogen in the fracture process zone can be one ormore orders of magnitude greater than the bulk concentration.
11.4.2 V ARIABLES  THAT AFFECT CRACKING  BEHAVIOR
Both the threshold K and the crack growth rate for hydrogen-driven cracking are controlled by a
complex interaction between the environment, the material properties, and the applied loading.Some of the key factors that inﬂuence cracking behavior are described below.
11.4.2.1Loading Rate and Load History
Most environmental cracking experiments are performed under constant load or constant displace-
ment conditions, but loads typically ﬂuctuate in service environments. The effect of load variationson hydrogen-driven cracking is complex. On the one hand, hydrogen embrittlement is enhancedby an actively straining crack tip, which implies that a rising load should produce more crackingthan static conditions. On the other hand, a ﬁnite time is required for the various steps involved inthe embrittlement process illustrated in Figure 11.16. As a result of these competing factors, loadﬂuctuations can either increase or decrease the susceptibility to EAC, depending on the material,environment, and the rate of load ﬂuctuation.
Following the principles of fracture mechanics similitude, the rate of variation of load or
displacement is best characterized by the rate of change in the applied stress intensity or .For a constant load test, if the crack is growing. In the case of a ﬁxed crack-mouth-opening displacement (CMOD), K decreases with crack growth in most specimen geometries. Near
the threshold, where cracking velocities are very small, for both constant load andconstant CMOD experiments. This issue is explored further in Section 11.6.2. A variety ofconditions may be encountered in practice.
Figure 11.17 is a plot of the apparent threshold K vs. for a high strength steel subject to
a rising load and a gaseous hydrogen environment [13]. The threshold, deﬁned as the onset ofmeasurable crack growth, increases monotonically with loading rate. Cracking, or lack thereof, inthis instance is controlled by the surface reactions at the crack tip and diffusion of atomic hydrogento the fracture process zone. At a sufﬁciently low , the measured threshold from rising loadtests agrees with that measured from ﬁxed load or ﬁxed CMOD tests.

532 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
For material/environment combinations that exhibit the behavior in Figure 11.17, the dK/dt
required to obtain a lower-bound threshold measurement from a rising load test is directly related
to the crack growth rate in Stage II [12]. In other words, if a material exhibits rapid crack growthin Stage II, the measured threshold is insensitive to dK/dt up to relatively high loading rates.
Figure 11.18 compares measured threshold values for rising load and ﬁxed CMOD tests in a
hydrogen-charged Cr-Mo steel [12]. At low strength levels, the rising load threshold is signiﬁcantlylower than the corresponding ﬁxed CMOD value. At high strength levels, slowly rising load andﬁxed CMOD tests give similar threshold estimates. The trend in Figure 11.18 may indicate thatthe threshold is sensitive to the crack-tip strain rate at lower strength levels. An alternate explanationis that the ﬁxed CMOD specimens, which were tested over a much longer time than the rising loadspecimens, lost hydrogen during the experiment.
Above the threshold, crack growth rates can increase with increasing dK/dt for low to moderate
loading rates. At high loading rates, the crack velocity is limited by electrochemical processes orthe rate of diffusion of hydrogen to the process zone.
In certain alloy/environment systems, HEAC can be exacerbated by small amplitude cyclic
loading (small ∆K and high R ratio). This so-called ripple loading  can signiﬁcantly reduce the
threshold K and signiﬁcantly increase the Stage II growth rate relative to static loading. Acceleration
of cracking due to ripple loading has been observed at very low amplitudes ,
where fatigue damage would be negligible in an inert environment. However, some have referredto this phenomenon as a form of corrosion fatigue. Whether or not one chooses to attach such alabel to HEAC under ripple loading depends on one’s deﬁnition of corrosion fatigue.

Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Metals 533
The cause of ripple loading effects is the subject of ongoing research [5,14]. These efforts are
focused on explaining the impact of small K ﬂuctuations on hydrogen production, uptake, and
damage at the crack tip. For low-strength alloys, Parkins [5] has stated that ripple loading effect
can be explained through passive ﬁlm rupture considerations.3
11.4.2.2 Strength
There is a large body of experimental evidence that indicates that the susceptibility to cracking by
a hydrogen embrittlement mechanism increases dramatically with increasing strength. Typically,the threshold K decreases and the Stage II growth rate increases with strength.
Figure 11.19 shows a signiﬁcant drop in the threshold stress intensity with increasing yield
strength in martensitic low-alloy steels stressed during immersion in a sodium chloride solution[15]. The effect is most pronounced at yield strength values below about 1350 MPa, whichcorresponds roughly to 200 ksi. 
Figure 11.20 is a plot of the Stage II crack growth rate vs. yield strength for turbine rotor steels
[20]. Note that da/dt increases exponentially with yield strength.
One possible explanation for the strength effect on hydrogen-driven EAC is that the stresses
inside the fracture process zone are proportional to yield strength. Higher stress in the process zoneFIGURE 11.18 Comparison of the apparent IHAC threshold for ﬁxed crack-mouth-opening displacement

at the crack tip. Therefore, exposing a fresh metal surface to the environment by rupturing the passive ﬁlm promotes HEAC.

results in more distortion of the crystal lattice, which provides a more welcoming environment for
atomic hydrogen to concentrate.
It is often difﬁcult to separate the inﬂuence of strength from other metallurgical factors,
because variations in strength in a given alloy are usually achieved by modifying the micro-structure. Figure 11.6 shows the effect of overaging in 7079 aluminum. Overaging softens thematerial by precipitate particle coarsening. It is not clear how much of the improvement incracking resistance is due purely to yield strength effects vs. the change in microstructure. Insome alloy systems, nanoscale features that contribute to strength also provide effective sitesfor H segregation [12].
11.4.2.3Amount of Available Hydrogen
As one would expect, the relative amount of hydrogen available to the crack tip is an important
factor in both HEAC and IHAC. In general, the threshold decreases and the Stage II crack growthrate increases when more hydrogen is available from either the crack-tip environment or thematerial surrounding the fracture process zone. Figure 11.21 illustrates the effect of the diffusiblehydrogen content
4 on the threshold for IHAC in AerMet® 100 [17]. When the concentration falls
below 1 part per million in terms of weight (wppm), the threshold K increases dramatically. Figure
11.22 is a plot of the threshold for HEAC in high-strength steel vs. H2 gas pressure [15]. Given
that H2 pressure is plotted on a logarithmic scale, the effect on the threshold is more gradual than
it is for dissolved hydrogen. For HEAC due to an electrolyte in the crack, the threshold K and
the Stage II growth rate are a function of the amount of hydrogen that is absorbed on the cracksurfaces near the tip.
11.4.2.4 Temperature
The temperature dependence of hydrogen-driven EAC is a reﬂection of the kinetics of the various
processes that control cracking. For example, the rate of IHAC is often controlled by the rate ofhydrogen diffusion to the fracture process zone. Diffusivity obeys an Arrhenius law:
(11.4)
where
Q = activation energy
R = gas constant
T = absolute temperature
Most of the processes that occur in HEAC also exhibit an Arrhenius (exponential) temperature
dependence. Consequently, crack growth rate also follows an Arrhenius relationship, at least overa limited temperature range.
Figure 11.23 illustrates the typical behavior for both HEAC and IHAC. The slope of the curve
is a reﬂection of the activation energy of the rate-controlling step in crack growth [12]. The crackgrowth rate reaches a maximum and then drops abruptly. This peak growth rate typically occurswithin 50–100 °C of ambient temperature.
The threshold K for most steels increases monotonically with temperature, as Figure 11.24
schematically illustrates. A typical K
IEAC vs. temperature curve has a similar shape as a toughness-
temperature curve for steels. Just as toughness in steel undergoes a brittle-to-ductile transition with

hydrogen is available to the fracture process zone.DD eoQR T=−/1656_C011.fm  Page 535  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:27 PM

11.5 CORROSION FATIGUE
Corrosion fatigue can be deﬁned as the acceleration of fatigue crack growth due to interaction with
the environment. Such acceleration of fatigue cracking can occur even in situations where EAC isnegligible under static loading (e.g., cyclic loads where K
max < KIEAC).
11.5.1 T IME-DEPENDENT  AND CYCLE-DEPENDENT  BEHAVIOR
Figure 11.25 illustrates three types of corrosion fatigue [18]. Corrosion fatigue can be cycle dependent(Figure 11.25(a)), time dependent (Figure 11.25(b)), or a combination of both (Figure 11.25(c)). Eachtype of behavior is discussed in more detail in this section.
Cycle-dependent corrosion fatigue, which is illustrated in Figure 11.25(a), corresponds to a simple
acceleration of the fatigue crack growth that is insensitive to the loading frequency. The crack growthrate can be represented by an acceleration factor Φ, multiplied by the inert growth rate:
(11.15)
This expression can be applied above the fatigue threshold ∆K
th for the inert environment. The
acceleration factor Φ may be a constant or it may vary with ∆K. Cycle-dependent corrosion fatigue
normally occurs in environments that do not result in signiﬁcant EAC under static loading and wheremass transport and electrochemical reactions that contribute to fatigue acceleration are very rapid.
Time-dependent corrosion fatigue (Figure 11.25(b)) can be modeled by a simple superposition
of the inert fatigue crack growth rate with the environmental cracking rate.
(11.16)
where is the average environmental crack growth rate over a loading cycle, and f is the
loading frequency. Figure 11.26 illustrates the superposition of the two cracking mechanisms, andFigure 11.27 deﬁnes the average EAC growth rate.
Most material–environment combinations exhibit both cycle-dependent and time-dependent
behavior. Combining Equation (11.15) and Equation (11.16) gives a more general expression forcorrosion fatigue:
(11.17)
Figure 11.28 illustrates the predicted effect of loading frequency on crack growth rate for
corrosion fatigue, based on the simple superposition model. By deﬁnition, the growth rate isindependent of frequency for cycle-dependent corrosion fatigue. Time-dependent corrosion fatigueis sensitive to frequency, as Equation (11.16) indicates. At high frequencies, the crack growth rateapproaches the inert rate because the EAC growth per cycle is negligible. At low frequencies, theenvironmental crack growth per cycle dominates over fatigue, and the rate is proportional to 1/ f.
When there is a combination of time-dependent and cycle-dependent acceleration of crack growthrate, the former dominates at low frequencies and the latter dominates at high frequencies.
Another variable that can affect the corrosion fatigue crack growth rate is the waveform of the
cyclic loading. This effect can be partially understood by studying Figure 11.27, which deﬁnes theaverage environmental crack growth rate over a given fatigue cycle. If, for example, the cyclic loadingfollowed a square waveform instead of a sine wave, one might expect the average EAC growth rateto be greater because the maximum load is held for a sustained period with a square waveform.A saw-tooth waveform might be expected to produce less environmental cracking per cycle, all elsebeing equal. A mitigating factor is that environmental cracking is often faster during periods when Kda

is increasing. In those instances, a square waveform might actually result in less environmental
cracking per cycle because a sustained load is less damaging than a continually rising load.
11.5.2 T YPICAL  DATA
Figure 11.29 shows corrosion fatigue data for C–Mn and alloy steels in seawater [19]. When comparedto the corresponding data for crack propagation in air, these data exhibit the trends one wouldexpect for time-dependent corrosion fatigue (Figure 11.26(b)).
Figure 11.30 is a plot of corrosion fatigue data for a high strength alloy steel in an H
2 gas
environment as well as a hydrogen-oxygen mixture and air [19]. There is a slight effect of frequencyin the H
2 gas environment, which is indicative of time-dependent behavior. When H2 gas is combined
with oxygen, the resulting behavior is identical to that for air, and there is no frequency dependence.
Figure 11.31 shows the effect of frequency on the corrosion fatigue behavior of two aluminum
alloys in a sodium chloride solution [19]. The 7079-T651 alloy exhibits a frequency dependencethat corresponds closely to the expected 1:1 trend (on a logarithmic plot) for time-dependentcorrosion fatigue, as schematically illustrated in Figure 11.28. The 2219-T87 alloy does not exhibita frequency dependence, but has an elevated growth rate relative to a purely inert environment. 
Figure 11.32 is a plot of da/dN vs. frequency for Inconel 600 in a sodium hydroxide solution
[19]. The crack growth rate exhibits a frequency dependence that asymptotically approaches the1:1 line at low frequencies. As frequency increases, da/dN asymptotically approaches the rate for
this material in air. Note, however, that the crack growth rate in air is elevated relative to the vacuumenvironment, which indicates that air is not a purely inert environment with respect to corrosionFIGURE 11.29 Corrosion fatigue behavior of several C–Mn and alloy steels in seawater.

fatigue. The air environment apparently produces cycle-dependent (time-independent) corrosion
fatigue. The relative shift between air and vacuum environments (or between air and an inert gasenvironment such as argon) has been observed in a variety of alloy systems. The possible reasonsfor this behavior are explored in the section on mechanisms.
Note that the frequency dependence of da/dN will approach the 1:1 slope on a logarithmic
scale (1/ f dependence) only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
1. The simple superposition model of Equation (11.16) and Equation (11.17) provides a
reasonably accurate description of the actual corrosion fatigue behavior.
2. The frequency is sufﬁciently low or the time-dependent cracking rate is sufﬁciently high that
the second term on the right-hand side of Equation (11.16) or Equation (11.17) dominates.
The data for 7079-T651 aluminum in Figure 11.31 exhibits the 1:1 trend at lower frequencies becausethis alloy is highly susceptible to time-dependent environmental cracking in the NaCl environment.Recently, however, Gasem and Gangloff [20] presented data for other 7000-series aluminum alloys ina variety of environments that shows much less sensitivity to frequency. The rate of time-dependentenvironmental cracking in the Gasem-Gangloff experiments was much less than in the earlier 7079-T651 data. Consequently, logarithmic plots of da/dN vs. frequency never approach the theoretical 1:1
slope. Another potential contributing factor to the lower observed sensitivity to frequency in some datasets may be that the simple superposition model is inadequate for these alloy/environment systems.More sophisticated mechanism-based corrosion fatigue models are being developed [20,21].
11.5.3 M ECHANISMS
Efforts to explain corrosion fatigue behavior have focused primarily on the same mechanisms thatare believed to control environmental cracking under static loading, namely, ﬁlm rupture/anodicdissolution mechanisms and hydrogen embrittlement. Additional considerations in corrosion fatigueFIGURE 11.32 Frequency dependence of corrosion fatigue of Inconel 600 in a sodium hydroxide solution.

are the interaction between cyclic plastic deformation and local chemical or electrochemical reac-
tions, as well as convective mixing effects on mass transport kinetics.
11.5.3.1 Film Rupture Models
Film rupture/anodic dissolution models have been proposed for corrosion fatigue in a number of
alloy/environment systems. Such models are an extension of those proposed for anodic SCC understatic loading (Figure 11.14 and Figure 11.15). In this view, cyclic plastic strain ruptures a protectiveﬁlm at the crack tip, resulting in transient anodic dissolution, followed by repassivation. The amountof environmental crack propagation per fatigue cycle depends on the kinetics of the reaction onthe clean metal surface as well as the time between ﬁlm ruptures. The latter depends on the crack-tip strain rate and ﬁlm ductility, and models that incorporate such effects have been used to explainthe frequency effect on crack growth rate.
11.5.3.2 Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement
Because hydrogen embrittlement appears to be the predominate mechanism for environmental
cracking under static and monotonic loading in a variety of alloy/environmental systems, it isreasonable to invoke this mechanism for cyclic loading in those same systems. As Figure 11.16illustrates, crack propagation occurs as a result of hydrogen absorption by the fracture process zonenear the crack tip, which leads to local embrittlement and microcracking. As with ﬁlm rupture/anodicdissolution mechanisms, hydrogen embrittlement is time dependent, which leads to a frequency effect.
Figure 11.30 shows an example of acceleration of fatigue crack propagation in 4340 steel due
to a gaseous hydrogen environment. When O
2 is mixed with H2, crack-tip embrittlement does not
occur because an oxygen reduction reaction (Equation 11.6) creates an oxide barrier on the surfacethat blocks H uptake.
Under static loading, 7079-T651 aluminum is susceptible to HEAC, as the data in Figure 11.6
indicate. Figure 11.31 shows that this alloy is also susceptible to time-dependent corrosion fatigue.A reasonable inference is that hydrogen uptake from the electrolyte is responsible for the acceler-ation in crack growth rate, given that this mechanism operates under static loading. Note that2219-T87 aluminum does not exhibit time-dependent corrosion fatigue behavior, which would seemto be an indication that this alloy is not susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement.
11.5.3.3Surface Films
Early studies of corrosion fatigue initiation from smooth surfaces focused on the effect of environ-
mentally produced thin ﬁlms on local slip processes that govern cyclic plastic deformation. Morerecently, the possible impact of surface ﬁlms on crack-tip behavior has been considered, but muchof the discussion in the published literature is speculative in nature, and experimental results thatprovide even circumstantial evidence for this theory are extremely limited. The view is that surfaceﬁlms may interfere with reversible slip during cycle loading, and thus have an impact on crack growth.
Surface ﬁlm effects have been proposed to explain the cycle-dependent acceleration of fatigue
of some alloy systems in air relative to an inert environment. In aluminum alloys, for example, ithas been hypothesized that the faster growth rate in air is due to irreversible slip and crack blunting,which produces striations. Flat, striation-free surfaces have been observed for fatigue of aluminumin a vacuum environment, while well-deﬁned striations occur when fatigue cracks propagate in air.
11.5.4 T HE EFFECT OF CORROSION  PRODUCT  WEDGING  ON FATIGUE
While a corrosive environment often results in an acceleration of fatigue crack growth rates, there areinstances where the environment has the opposite effect. Anodic dissolution inside a crack can resultin the crack being ﬁlled with an oxide or other corrosion product. The volume of the corrosion product1656_C011.fm  Page 544  Monday, May 23, 2005  5:27 PM
Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Metals 545
may be two or three times that of the metal that was consumed in the anodic reaction. An expanding
corrosion product inside the crack tip can lead to wedge loading, as discussed in Section 11.3.4.
While the propensity for corrosion product wedging to inﬂuence anodic SCC under static
loading is a matter of debate, the effect on fatigue crack propagation is well established. Figure 11.33illustrates the inﬂuence of a corrosion product on the effective ∆K. At low applied load levels, K
I
is independent of load because it is controlled by the wedging action of the corrosion product. Inorder for the applied stress intensity to increase above K
wedge, the load must be sufﬁcient to open
the crack to a displacement that is greater than the corrosion product thickness. The result is adiminished ∆K
eff, which in turn results in a reduced crack growth rate. This effect is most pronounced
at low R ratios and near the threshold ∆K.
Corrosion product wedging results in an increase in the threshold and enhanced sensitivity to
the R ratio. See Chapter 10 for a more extensive discussion of the effect of crack wedging (from
corrosion products and other sources) on fatigue.
11.6 EXPERIMENT AL METHODS
Traditional experimental methods to evaluate the behavior of materials subjected to aggressiveenvironments while under stress involved tests on smooth specimens. Such tests reﬂected bothinitiation and propagation stages of environmental cracking. Beginning in the 1960s, researchersperformed environmental cracking experiments on pre-cracked specimens and applied the principlesof linear elastic fracture mechanics. Today, both smooth-specimen tests and fracture-mechanics-based tests are routinely performed. The most important aspects of either type of test are: (1) strictcontrol of the environment to which the specimen is exposed and (2) accurate measurements ofcrack initiation and propagation.
Smooth specimen tests are largely qualitative, and they can provide an overly optimistic assess-
ment of the material performance in the presence of a corrosive environment. In many instances,materials that exhibit little or no susceptibility to environmental cracking in smooth-specimen testsshow a high degree of susceptibility when a precracked specimen of that material is tested in thesame environment. Titanium alloys are particularly susceptible to this behavior. Occluded chemistryFIGURE 11.33 Effect of corrosion product wedging on the effective cyclic stress intensity.

546 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
effects, discussed in Section 11.2.2, are partially responsible for the different behavior at a smooth
surface vs. the tip of a pit, crevice, or crack. Local stress concentration effects are another factor.
Common test methods for both smooth specimens and cracked specimens are described in the
following section.
11.6.1 T ESTS ON SMOOTH  SPECIMENS
Two of the oldest test methods for assessing environmental cracking susceptibility are the U-bendtest and the bent-beam test. The test conﬁgurations are illustrated in Figure 11.34 and Figure 11.35,respectively. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has published standardprocedures for both test methods [22,23]. For each test method, the specimen and loading apparatusare self-contained, so there is no need for a test machine. The entire assembly can be placed in theenvironment of interest.
The bent-beam test is suitable for testing in the elastic range. The applied stress in the specimen
can be computed with standard beam deﬂection equations. A U-bend specimen is typically loadedinto the plastic range, so the precise stress and strain state are usually not known.
The slow strain rate test, as the name suggests, involves slowly loading a tensile specimen
(Figure 11.36) exposed to a potentially corrosive environment. The advantage of this test over theU-bend and bent-beam tests is that it is normally faster because the active straining acceleratescrack initiation and propagation. A disadvantage of this test is that a special test machine is required.An ASTM Standard [24] provides a detailed procedure for performing slow strain rate tests.FIGURE 11.34 The U-bend test.

11.6.2 F RACTURE  MECHANICS  TEST METHODS
Most tests of cracked specimens in aggressive environments fall into one of the following categories:
1. Constant load
2. Constant displacement3. Cyclic loading (corrosion fatigue)
4. Controlled K history
The ﬁrst two types of tests are the most common and are covered by the ASTM Standard E 1681[25]. Constant load and displacement testing are discussed in more detail below. The proceduresfor performing corrosion fatigue experiments on precracked specimens are essentially the same asfor tests in air, but with the added complexity associated with exposing the specimen to theappropriate environment. An example of the fourth type of experiment is the rising K test, where
dK/dt is controlled. The data in Figure 11.17 were obtained from a series of rising K tests. Both
cyclic and K-controlled testing require a closed loop servo-hydraulic or servo-electric test machine.
Constant load and constant displacement testing can each be performed with a simpler and lesscostly apparatus. All such specimens require a fatigue precrack.
Figure 11.37 illustrates a cantilever bend test. This is the most common type of constant load
test. An edge-cracked bend specimen is ﬁxed at one end and a constant weight is applied to theopposite end. The central portion of the specimen, which contains a fatigue precrack, is exposedto the environment of interest.FIGURE 11.36 Tensile specimen for the slow strain rate test.

548 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Figure 11.38 is a schematic illustration of the crack growth behavior in a constant load test.
The specimen is loaded to an initial KI, which increases with crack growth. Failure occurs when
the applied KI reaches the fracture toughness of the material. When the initial KI is close to the threshold
for environmental cracking, the duration of the test may be very long. It is easy to overestimate KIEAC
in a constant load test because there may be no detectable cracking for a signiﬁcant period of time
despite the fact that the applied KI is above the true threshold.
Figure 11.39 illustrates the inherent difﬁculty of estimating KIEAC from a constant load test [26].
When a precracked specimen is ﬁrst exposed to the corrosive environment, there is an incubation
time that precedes crack propagation. The incubation time often increases with decreasing KI. The
incubation time can be very long when the initial applied KI is close to KIEAC. Therefore, whenFIGURE 11.38 Environmental crack growth under constant applied load.

Environmentally Assisted Cracking in Metals 549
there is no discernable cracking over a prolonged period of time, there is no way to know whether
the applied KI is above or below KIEAC.
A constant CMOD test is a much more efﬁcient means for estimating the threshold for cracking
in a given material and environment. A standard specimen conﬁguration for such a test is illustratedin Figure 11.40. The bolt-loaded specimen is a modiﬁed version of the standard compact specimen(Figure 7.1). The bolt is tightened to produce the desired CMOD. The applied K
I is related to
CMOD through the following expression [25]: 
(11.18)
where 
V = CMOD
E = Young’s modulus
f(a/W ) = dimensionless geometry factor
(11.19)
Figure 11.41 is a plot of Equation (11.19). Note that KI decreases with crack size when CMOD
is ﬁxed in the bolt-loaded compact specimen. A decreasing KI is an important feature of this
specimen conﬁguration. A high initial KI can be imposed at the beginning of the test in order to
minimize incubation time (Figure 11.39). The applied KI decreases with crack growth. Once KI
reaches the threshold, the crack arrests. Therefore, KIEAC can be inferred by exposing the specimen
for a sufﬁciently long time, measuring the ﬁnal crack length (after fracturing the specimen), andthen substituting the ﬁnal crack size and applied CMOD into Equation (11.18) and Equation (11.19).
If practical, it is desirable to measure the crack length at various points during a test on a bolt-
loaded compact specimen. Such measurements can conﬁrm whether or not the crack has, in fact,arrested and thus the threshold has been reached. Moreover, continuous crack length measurementscan be used to infer crack growth rate prior to reaching the threshold. Real-time crack lengthmeasurements can be accomplished in one of two ways. The compliance method can be applied if aspecial bolt equipped with a load cell is used. Alternatively, electric potential methods can be usedto infer crack size. See Chapter 7 for more information on compliance and electric potential methods.FIGURE 11.40 Constant CMOD bolt-loaded compact specimen. Taken from E 1681-03, “Standard Test Method

Figure 11.42 illustrates the procedure for determining crack growth rate and threshold from a
test on a bolt-loaded compact specimen. Periodic crack length measurements are used to compute
crack growth rate and KI as a function of time. The threshold can be inferred by extrapolating the
growth rate down to a suitably low value, as illustrated in Figure 11.8.
Data obtained from bolt-loaded compact specimens should be used with caution when service
conditions include loads that vary with time. As Figure 11.17 and Figure 11.18 illustrate, thethreshold can be affected by loading rate. A rising load can either increase or decrease K

depending on strength and other factors. The crack growth rate is often accelerated by a risingload. Certain material–environment combinations are susceptible to ripple load effects, as dis-cussed in Section 11.4.2.
Setting aside the practical difﬁculties associated with threshold measurements in constant load
tests, there should be no signiﬁcant difference between K
IEAC values obtained from constant load
vs. constant CMOD tests, provided the former is of sufﬁcient duration to overcome incubationeffects. Consider a conventional fracture mechanics specimen in which K
I is related to the applied
load and specimen dimensions. Referring to Chapter 7, KI expressions for such specimens typically
have the following form:
(11.20)
Differentiating the above expression with respect to time gives
(11.21)
If the applied load is constant, the ﬁrst term in Equation (11.21) vanishes:
(11.22)
Similarly, the rate of change in KI in a constant CMOD test can be determined by differentiating
Equation (11.18):
(11.23)
If the crack is growing,  for a constant load test and  for a constant CMOD test dueto the sign on  in the above expressions. Near the threshold, however,  is very small,so  for both cases. Therefore, since there are no signiﬁcant differences in the crack-tipconditions near the threshold for constant load and constant CMOD tests, the latter test method isusually preferable because it is considerably simpler and less time consuming. However, the constantCMOD specimen is prone to corrosion product wedging in some alloy/environment systems, whichcan obscure the threshold measurement.
The rising- K test has recently gained popularity as a means to estimate the threshold for
environmental cracking [12]. The advantage of this test method is that its duration is typically muchshorter than either the constant load or constant CMOD tests. A disadvantage is that it requires acomputer-controlled test machine that is equipped with a suitable environmental chamber. More-over, as the data in Figure 11.17 illustrate, a rising- K test can overestimate the threshold in high
strength alloys if  is too high.KP

Computational Fracture 
Mechanics 
Computers have had an enormous inﬂuence in virtually all branches of engineering, and fracture
mechanics is no exception. Numerical modeling has become an indispensable tool in fractureanalysis, since relatively few practical problems have closed-form analytical solutions.
Stress-intensity solutions for literally hundreds of conﬁgurations have been published, the
majority of which were inferred from numerical models. Elastic-plastic analyses to compute the  
J 
integral and crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) are also becoming relatively common. Inaddition, researchers are applying advanced numerical techniques to special problems, such asfracture at interfaces, dynamic fracture, and ductile crack growth.
Rapid advances in computer technology are primarily responsible for the exponential growth
in applications of computational fracture mechanics. The personal computers that most engineershave on their desks are more powerful than mainframe computers of 10–20 years ago. 
Hardware does not deserve all of the credit for the success of computational fracture mechanics,
however. More efﬁcient numerical algorithms have greatly reduced solution times in fracture problems.For example, the domain integral approach (Section 12.3) enables one to generate  
K 
 and  
J 
 solutions
from ﬁnite element models with surprisingly coarse meshes. Commercial numerical analysis codeshave become relatively user friendly, and many codes have incorporated fracture mechanics routines.
This chapter will not turn the reader into an expert on computational fracture mechanics, but it
should serve as an introduction to the subject. The sections that follow describe some of the traditionalapproaches in numerical analysis of fracture problems, as well as some recent innovations.
The format of this chapter differs from earlier chapters, in that the main body of this chapter
contains several relatively complicated mathematical derivations; previous chapters conﬁned suchmaterial to appendices. This information is unavoidable when explaining the basis of the commonnumerical techniques. Readers who are intimidated by the mathematical details should at least skimthis material and attempt to understand its signiﬁcance. 
12.1 OVERVIEW OF NUMERICAL METHODS 
It is often necessary to determine the distribution of stresses and strains in a body that is subjectto external loads or displacements. In limited cases, it is possible to obtain a closed-form analyticalsolution for the stresses and strains. If, for example, the body is subject to either plane stress orplane strain loading and is composed of an isotropic linear elastic material, it may be possible toﬁnd a stress function that leads to the desired solution. Westergaard [1] and Williams [2] used suchan approach to derive solutions for the stresses and strains near the tip of a sharp crack in an elasticmaterial (see Appendix 2). In most instances, however, closed-form solutions are not possible, andthe stresses in the body must be estimated numerically. 
1 
A variety of numerical techniques have been applied to problems in solid mechanics, including
ﬁnite difference [3], ﬁnite element [4], and boundary integral equation methods [5]. In recent years,the latter two numerical methods have been applied almost exclusively. The vast majority of analyses 
1  
Experimental stress analysis methods, such as photoelasticity, Moire' interferometry, and caustics are available, even these
techniques often require numerical analysis to interpret experimental observations.12

In the ﬁnite element method, the structure of interest is subdivided into discrete shapes called 
elements 
. The most common element types include one-dimensional beams, two-dimensional plane
stress or plane strain elements, and three-dimensional bricks or tetrahedrons. The elements areconnected at  
node 
 points where continuity of the displacement ﬁelds is enforced. The dimensionality
of the structure need not correspond to the element dimension. For example, a three-dimensionaltruss can be constructed from beam elements.
The  
stiffness ﬁnite element method 
 [4] is usually applied to stress analysis problems. This
approach is outlined below for the two-dimensional case.
Figure 12.1 shows an  
isoparametric 
 continuum element for two-dimensional plane stress or
plane strain problems, together with local and global coordinate axes. The local coordinates, whichare also called  
parametric 
 coordinates, vary from  
− 
1 to  
+ 
1 over the element area; the node at the
lower left-hand corner has parametric coordinates ( 
− 
1,  
− 
1) while upper right-hand corner is at ( 
+ 
1,  
+ 
1)
in the local system. Note that the parametric coordinate system is not necessarily orthogonal.Consider a point on the element at ( 
x 
, 
h 
). The global coordinates of this point are given by
(12.1)
where  
n 
 is the number of nodes in the element and  
N 
i 
 are the shape functions corresponding to the
node  
i 
, whose coordinates are (

y

) in the global system and (

The shape functions are polynomials that interpolate ﬁeld quantities within the element. The
degree of the polynomial depends on the number of nodes in the element. If, for example, the
element contains nodes only at the corners,  
N 
i 
 are linear. Figure 12.1 illustrates a four-sided, eight-
node element, which requires a quadratic interpolation. Appendix 12 gives the shape functions forthe latter case.
The displacements within an element are interpolated as follows:

ticity, stress and strain are computed incrementally and [

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
Thus the stress and strain distribution throughout the body can be inferred from the nodal displace-
ments and the constitutive law. The stresses and strains are usually evaluated at several Gauss points
or integration points within each element. For two-dimensional elements, 2  
×  
2 Gaussian integration
is typical, where there are four integration points on each element.
The displacements at the nodes depend on the element stiffness and the nodal forces. The
elemental stiffness matrix is given by
(12.8)
where the superscript  
T 
 denotes the transpose of the matrix. Equation (12.8) can be derived from
the principle of minimum potential energy [4].
The elemental stiffness matrices are assembled to give the global stiffness matrix [ 
K 
]. The global
force, displacement, and stiffness matrices are related as follows:

Most problems in nature cannot be solved mathematically without specifying appropriate boundaryconditions. In solid mechanics, for example, a well posed problem is one in which either thetractions or the displacements (but not both) are speciﬁed over the entire surface. In the generalcase, the surface of a body can be divided into two regions:  
S 
u 
, where displacements are speciﬁed,
and  
S 
T 
, where tractions are speciﬁed. One cannot specify both traction and displacement on the
same area, since one quantity depends on the other. Given these boundary conditions, it is theo-retically possible to solve for the tractions on  
S 
u 
 and the displacements on  
S 
T 
, as well as the stresses,
strains, and displacements within the body.
The boundary integral equation (BIE) method [5–9] is a very powerful technique for solving
for unknown tractions and displacements on the surface. This approach can also provide solutionsfor internal ﬁeld quantities, but ﬁnite element analysis is more efﬁcient for this purpose.
The BIE method stems from Betti’s reciprocal theorem, which relates work done by two
different loadings on the same body. In the absence of body forces, Betti’s theorem can be statedas follows:
(12.10)
where  
T 
i 
 and  
u 
i 
 are components of the traction and displacement vectors, respectively, and the
superscripts denote loadings (1) and (2). The standard convention is followed in this chapter, whererepeated indices imply summation. Equation (12.10) can be derived from the principle of virtualwork, together with the fact that for a linear elastic material.
Let us assume that (1) is the loading of interest and (2) is a reference loading with a known
solution. Figure 12.2 illustrates the conventional reference boundary conditions for BIE problems.A unit force is applied at an interior point  
p 
 in each of the three coordinate directions  
x 
i 
, resulting
in displacements and tractions at surface point  
Q 
 in the  
x 
j 
 direction. For example, a unit force in
the  
x 
1 
 direction may produce displacements and tractions at  
Q 
 in all three coordinate directions.
Consequently, the resulting displacements and tractions at  
Q 
,  
u 
ij 
 and  
T 
ij 
, are second-order tensors.
The quantities

) and  
T 
ij 
(

Q 
) have closed-form solutions for several cases, including a point

Applying the Betti reciprocal theorem to the boundary conditions described above [5] leads to
(12.11)
where ui(p) is the displacement vector at the interior point p, uj(Q) and Tj(Q) are the reference
displacement and traction vectors at the boundary point Q. Note that ui(p), uj(Q), and Tj(Q)
correspond to the loading of interest, i.e., loading (1). At a given point Q on the boundary, either
traction or displacement is known a priori , and it is necessary to solve for the other quantity. If
we let p → P, where P is a point on the surface, Equation (12.11) becomes [5]
(12.12)
assuming the surface is smooth. (This relationship is modiﬁed slightly when P is near a corner or
other discontinuity.) Equation (12.12) represents a set of integral constraint equations that relate
surface displacements to surface tractions. In order to solve for the unknown boundary data, thesurface must be subdivided into segments (i.e., elements), and Equation (12.12) approximated bya system of algebraic equations. If it is assumed that u
i and Ti vary linearly between discrete nodal
points on the surface, Equation (12.12) can be written as
(12.13)
where dij is the Kronecker delta. Equation (12.13) represents a set of 3 n equations for a three-
dimensional problem, where  n is the number of nodes. Once all of the boundary quantities are
known, displacements at internal points can be inferred from Equation (12.11).
The boundary elements have one less dimension than the body being analyzed. That is, the
boundary of a two-dimensional problem is surrounded by one-dimensional elements, while thesurface of a three-dimensional solid is paved with two-dimensional elements. Consequently, bound-ary element analysis can be very efﬁcient, particularly when the boundary quantities are of primaryinterest. This method tends to be inefﬁcient, however, when solving for internal ﬁeld quantities.FIGURE 12.2 Reference boundary conditions for a boundary integral element problem. Unit forces are applied

558 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
The boundary integral equation method is usually applied to linear elastic problems, but this
technique can also be utilized for elastic-plastic analysis [6,9]. As with the ﬁnite element technique,
nonlinear BIE analyses are typically performed incrementally, and the stress-strain relationship isassumed to be linear within each increment.
12.2 TRADITION AL METHODS IN COMPUT ATION AL 
FRACTURE MECHANICS
This section describes several of the earlier approaches for inferring fracture mechanics parametersfrom numerical analysis. Most of these methods have been made obsolete by more recent techniquesthat are signiﬁcantly more accurate and efﬁcient (Section 12.3).
The approaches outlined below can be divided into two categories: point matching and energy
methods. The former technique entails inferring the stress-intensity factor from the stress or displace-ment ﬁelds in the body, while energy methods compute the energy release rate in the body and relateG to stress intensity. One advantage of energy methods is that they can be applied to nonlinear material
behavior; a disadvantage is that it is more difﬁcult to separate energy release rate into mixed-modeK components.
Most of the techniques described below can be implemented with either ﬁnite element or
boundary element methods. The stiffness derivative approach (Section 12.2.4), however, was for-mulated in terms of the ﬁnite element stiffness matrix, and thus is not compatible with boundaryelement analysis.
12.2.1 S TRESS AND DISPLACEMENT  MATCHING
The stress-intensity factor can be estimated from stresses in front of the crack tip or displacementsbehind the crack tip, as described below. Figure 12.3 shows the assumed local coordinate systemat the crack tip.
Consider a cracked body subject to pure Mode I loading. On the crack plane ( q = 0), K
I is
related to the stress normal to the crack plane as follows:
(12.14)
The stress-intensity factor can be inferred by plotting the quantity in square brackets against distancefrom the crack tip, and extrapolating to r = 0. Alternatively, K
I can be estimated from a similar
FIGURE 12.3 Local coordinate system for stresses and displacements at the crack tip in a ﬁnite element or
boundary element model.KrIryy==

extrapolation of crack-opening displacement uy. For plane strain conditions, KI is estimated from
the following extrapolation:
(12.15a)
For plane stress loading, the KI estimate is given by
(12.15b)
The above expressions were derived from the Mode I stress and displacement solutions in
Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 by setting  and  for normal stress and normal displacement,
respectively. Corresponding stress intensity estimates for Mode II and Mode III can also be inferredfrom Table 2.1 to Table 2.3.
Equation (12.15a) and Equation (12.15b) tend to give more accurate estimates of K
I than
Equation (12.14) because stresses are singular as r → 0 but displacements are proportional to
near the crack tip. The stress-matching method requires a high degree of mesh reﬁnement toobtain accurate K
I estimates. Section 12.5 presents a series of convergence studies that compare
the relative efﬁciency of the above methods with the modern approach based on the J integral
(Section 12.3).
The boundary collocation method [11,12] is an alternative point-matching technique for com-
puting stress-intensity factors. This approach entails ﬁnding stress functions that satisfy the bound-ary conditions at various nodes, and inferring the stress-intensity factor from these functions. Forplane stress or plane strain problems, the Airy stress function (Appendix 2) can be expressed interms of two complex analytic functions, which can be represented as polynomials in the complexvariable . In a boundary collocation analysis, the coefﬁcients of the polynomials areinferred from nodal quantities. The minimum number of nodes used in the analysis correspondsto the number of unknown coefﬁcients in the polynomials. The results can be improved by analyzingmore than the minimum number of nodes and solving for the unknowns by least squares. Thisapproach can be highly cumbersome; displacement matching or energy methods are preferable inmost instances.
Early researchers in computational fracture mechanics attempted to reduce the mesh size require-
ments for point-matching analyses by introducing special elements at the crack tip that exhibitthe singularity [13]. Barsoum [14] later showed that this same effect could be achieved by a slightmodiﬁcation to conventional isoparametric elements (see Section 12.4 and Appendix 12).
12.2.2 E LEMENTAL  CRACK ADVANCE
Recall from Chapter 2 that the energy release rate can be inferred from the rate of change in globalpotential energy with crack growth. If two separate numerical analyses of a given geometry areperformed, one with crack length a, and the other with crack length a + ∆a, the energy release rate
is given by

This technique requires minimal postprocessing, since total strain energy is output by many
commercial analysis codes. This technique is also more efﬁcient than the point-matching methods,
since global energy estimates do not require reﬁned meshes.
One disadvantage of the elemental crack advance method is that multiple solutions are required
in this case, while other methods infer the desired crack-tip parameter from a single analysis. Thismay not be a serious shortcoming if the intention is to compute G (or K ) as a function of crack
size. The numerical differentiation in Equation (12.16), however, can result in signiﬁcant errorsunless the crack length intervals ( ∆a) are small.
12.2.3 C ONTOUR  INTEGRATION
The J integral can be evaluated numerically along a contour surrounding the crack tip. The advan-
tages of this method are that it can be applied both to linear and nonlinear problems, and pathindependence (in elastic materials) enables the user to evaluate J at a remote contour, where
numerical accuracy is greater. For problems that include path-dependent plastic deformation or thermalstrains, it is still possible to compute J at a remote contour, provided an appropriate correction term
(i.e., an area integral) is applied [15,16].
For three-dimensional problems, however, the contour integral becomes a surface integral,
which is extremely difﬁcult to evaluate numerically.
More recent numerical formulations for evaluating J apply an area integration for two-dimensional
problems and a volume integration for three-dimensional problems. Area and volume integrals providemuch better accuracy than contour and surface integrals, and are much easier to implement numerically.The ﬁrst such approach was the stiffness derivative formulation of the virtual crack extensionmethod, which is described below. This approach has since been improved and made more general,as Section 12.2.5 and Section 12.3 discuss.
12.2.4 V IRTUAL  CRACK EXTENSION : STIFFNESS  DERIVATIVE  FORMULATION
In 1974, Parks [10] and Hellen [17] independently proposed the following ﬁnite element methodfor inferring energy release rate in elastic bodies. Several years later, Parks [18] extended thismethod to nonlinear behavior and large deformation at the crack tip. Although the stiffness derivativemethod is now outdated, it was the precursor to the modern approaches described in Section 12.2.5and Section 12.3.
Consider a two-dimensional cracked body with unit thickness, subject to Mode I loading. The
potential energy of the body, in terms of the ﬁnite element solution, is given by
(12.17)
where Π is the potential energy, and the other quantities are as deﬁned in Section 12.1.1. Recall
from Chapter 2 that the energy release rate is the derivative of Π with respect to crack area, for
both ﬁxed load and ﬁxed displacement conditions. It is convenient in this instance to evaluate G
under ﬁxed load conditions:
(12.18)
Comparing Equation (12.9) to the above result, we see that the ﬁrst term in Equation (12.18)
must be zero. In the absence of tractions on the crack face, the third term must also vanish, since∏= −1

loads are held constant. Thus, the energy release rate is given by
(12.19)
The energy release rate is proportional to the derivative of the stiffness matrix with respect to crack length.
Suppose that we have generated a ﬁnite element mesh for a body with crack length a and we
wish to extend the crack by ∆a. It would not be necessary to change all of the elements in the
mesh; we could accommodate the crack growth by moving elements near the crack tip and leaving
the rest of the mesh intact. Figure 12.4 illustrates such a process, where elements inside the contourΓ
o are shifted by ∆a, and elements outside of the contour Γ1 are unaffected. Each of the elements
between Γo and Γ1 is distorted, such that its stiffness changes. The energy release rate is related to
this change in element stiffness:
(12.20)
where [ ki] are the elemental stiffness matrices and Nc is the number of elements between the contours
Γo and Γ1. Parks [10] demonstrated that Equation (12.20) is equivalent to the J integral. The value
of G (or J ) is independent of the choice of the inner and outer contours.
It is important to note that in a virtual crack extension analysis, it is not necessary to generate
a second mesh with a slightly longer crack. It is sufﬁcient merely to calculate the change in elementalstiffness matrices corresponding to shifts in the nodal coordinates.
One problem with the stiffness derivative approach is that it involves cumbersome numerical dif-
ferencing. Also, this formulation is poorly suited to problems that include thermal strain. A more recentformulation of the virtual crack extension method overcomes these difﬁculties, as discussed below.
12.2.5 V IRTUAL  CRACK EXTENSION : CONTINUUM  APPROACH
Parks [10] and Hellen [17] formulated the virtual crack extension approach in terms of ﬁnite elementstiffness and displacement matrices. deLorenzi [19,20] improved the virtual crack extension methodby considering the energy release rate of a continuum. The main advantages of the continuum(a) (b)

approach are twofold: ﬁrst, the methodology is not restricted to the ﬁnite element method; and
second, deLorenzi’s approach does not require numerical differencing.
Figure 12.5 illustrates a virtual crack advance in a two-dimensional continuum. Material points
inside Γo experience rigid body translation of a distance ∆a in the x1 direction, while points outside
of Γ1 remain ﬁxed. In the region between contours, virtual crack extension causes material points
to translate by ∆x1. For an elastic material, or one that obeys deformation plasticity theory, deLorenzi
showed that energy release rate is given by
(12.21)
where w is the strain energy density. Equation (12.21) assumes unit thickness, crack growth in the
x1 direction, no body forces within Γ1, and no tractions on the crack faces. Note that
outside of Γ1 and within Γo; thus the integration need only be performed over the annular region
between Γo and Γ1.
deLorenzi actually derived a more general expression that considers a three-dimensional body,
tractions on the crack surface, and body forces:
(12.22)
where 
∆Ac = increase in the crack area generated by the virtual crack advance
V = volume of the body
Fi = body forces
In this instance, two surfaces enclose the crack front. Material points within the inner surface
So are displaced by ∆ai, while the material outside of the outer surface S1 remains ﬁxed. The
displacement vector between So and S1 is ∆xi, which ranges from 0 to ∆ai. Equation (12.22) assumes
a ﬁxed coordinate system; consequently, the virtual crack advance ∆ai is not necessarily in the x1
direction when the crack front is curved. The above expression, however, only applies to virtualcrack advance normal to the crack front, in the plane of the crack.(a) (b)

In a three-dimensional problem, G typically varies along the crack front. In computing G, one
can consider a uniform virtual crack advance over the entire crack front or a crack advance over
a small increment, as Figure 12.6 illustrates. In the former case, ∆Ac = ∆aL, and the computed
energy release rate would be a weighted average. Deﬁning Ac incrementally along the crack front
would result in a local measure of G.
For two-dimensional problems, the virtual crack extension formulation of G requires an area
integration, while three-dimensional problems require a volume integration. Such an approach iseasier to implement numerically and is more accurate than contour and surface integrations fortwo- and three-dimensional problems, respectively.
Numerical implementation of the virtual crack extension method entails applying a virtual
displacement to nodes within a speciﬁed contour. Since the domain integral formulation is verysimilar to the above method, further discussion on numerical implementation is deferred toSection 12.3.3.
12.3 THE ENERGY DOMAIN INTEGRAL
Shih et al. [21,22] formulated the energy domain integral methodology, which is a general frame-work for numerical analysis of the J integral. This approach is extremely versatile, as it can be
applied to both quasistatic and dynamic problems with elastic, plastic, or viscoplastic materialresponse, as well as thermal loading. Moreover, the domain integral formulation is relatively simpleto implement numerically, and it is very efﬁcient. This approach is very similar to the virtual crackextension method.
12.3.1 T HEORETICAL  BACKGROUND
Appendix 4.2 presents a derivation of a general expression for the J integral that includes the effects
of inertia as well as inelastic material behavior. The generalized deﬁnition of J requires that the
contour surrounding the crack tip be vanishingly small:
(12.23)
where T is the kinetic energy density. Various material behavior can be taken into account through
the deﬁnition of w, the stress work.(a) (b)

564 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Consider an elastic-plastic material loaded under quasistatic conditions ( T = 0). If thermal
strains are present, the total strain is given by
(12.24)
where a is the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion and Θ is the temperature relative to a strain-free
condition. The superscripts e, p, m, and t denote elastic, plastic, mechanical, and thermal strains,
respectively. The mechanical strain is equal to the sum of elastic and plastic components. The stress
work is given by
(12.25)
The form of Equation (12.23) is not suitable for numerical analysis, since it is not feasible to
evaluate stresses and strains along a vanishingly small contour. Let us construct a closed contourby connecting inner and outer contours, as Figure 12.7 illustrates. The outer contour Γ
1 is ﬁnite,
while Γo is vanishingly small. For a linear or nonlinear elastic material under quasistatic conditions,
J could be evaluated along either Γ1 or Γo, but only the inner contour gives the correct value of J
in the general case. For quasistatic conditions, where T = 0, Equation (12.23) can be written in
terms of the following integral around the closed contour, [21,22]:
(12.26)
where 
Γ+ and Γ− = upper and lower crack faces, respectively
mi = outward normal on Γ*
q = arbitrary but smooth function that is equal to unity on Γo and zero on Γ1 
Note that mi = −ni on Γo; also, m1 = 0 and m2 = ±1 on Γ+ and Γ−. In the absence of crack-face
tractions, the second integral in Equation (12.26) vanishes.

For the moment, assume that the crack faces are traction free. Applying the divergence theorem
to Equation (12.26) gives
(12.27)
where A* is the area enclosed by Γ*. Referring to Appendix 3.2, we see that
(12.28)
when there are no body forces and w exhibits the properties of an elastic potential:
(12.29)
It is convenient at this point to divide w into elastic and plastic components:
(12.30)
where Sij is the deviatoric stress, deﬁned in Equation (A3.62). While the elastic components of w
and eij satisfy Equation (12.29), plastic deformation does not, in general, exhibit the properties of
a potential. (Equation (12.29) may be approximately valid for plastic deformation when there is
no unloading.) Moreover, thermal strains would cause the left side of Equation (12.28) to benonzero. Thus the second integrand in Equation (12.27) vanishes in limited circumstances, but notin general. Taking account of plastic strain, thermal strain, body forces, and crack face-tractionsleads to the following general expression for J in two dimensions:
(12.31)
where the body force contribution is inferred from the equilibrium equations, and the contributionfrom thermal loading is obtained by substituting Equation (12.24) and Equation (12.30) intoEquation (12.27). Inertia can be taken into account by incorporating T, the kinetic energy density,
into the group of terms that are multiplied by q. For a linear or nonlinear elastic material under
quasistatic conditions, in the absence of body forces, thermal strains, and crack-face tractions,Equation (12.31) reduces to
(12.32)
Equation (12.32) is equivalent to Rice’s path-independent J integral (Chapter 3). When the sum of
the additional terms in the more general expression (Equation 12.31) is nonzero, J is path dependent.Jxu

566 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
Comparing Equation (12.21) and Equation (12.32) we see that the two expressions are identical
if q = ∆x1/∆a. Thus q can be interpreted as a normalized virtual displacement, although the above
derivation does not require such an interpretation. The q function is merely a mathematical device
that enables the generation of an area integral, which is better suited to numerical calculations.
Section 12.3.3 provides guidelines for deﬁning q. 
12.3.2 G ENERALIZATION  TO THREE DIMENSIONS
Equation (12.23) deﬁnes the J integral in both two and three dimensions, but the form of this
equation is poorly suited to numerical analysis. In the previous section, J was expressed in terms
of an area integral in order to facilitate numerical evaluation. For three-dimensional problems, itis necessary to convert Equation (12.23) into a volume integral.
Figure 12.8 illustrates a planar crack in a three-dimensional body; h corresponds to the position
along the crack front. Suppose that we wish to evaluate J at a particular h on the crack front. It is
convenient to deﬁne a local coordinate system at h, with x
1 normal to the crack front, x2 normal
to the crack plane, and x3 tangent to the crack front. The J integral at h is deﬁned by Equation
(12.23), where the contour Γo lies in the x1–x2 plane.
Let us now construct a tube of length ∆L and radius ro that surrounds a segment of the crack
front, as Figure 12.8 illustrates. Assuming quasistatic conditions, we can deﬁne a weighted average
J over the crack front segment ∆L as follows:
(12.33)
where 
J(h) = point-wise value of J
So = surface area of the tube in Figure 12.8

Computational Fracture Mechanics 567
Note that the integrand in Equation (12.33) is evaluated in terms of the local coordinate system,
where x3 is tangent to the crack front at each point along ∆L.
Recall from the previous section that q can be interpreted as a virtual crack advance. For
example, Figure 12.9 illustrates an incremental crack advance over ∆L, where q is deﬁned by
(12.34)
and the incremental area of the virtual crack advance is given by
(12.35)
The q function need not be deﬁned in terms of a virtual crack extension, but attaching a physical
signiﬁcance to this parameter may aid in understanding.
If we construct a second tube of radius r1 around the crack front (Figure 12.10), it is possible
to deﬁne the weighted average J in terms of a closed surface, analogous to the two-dimensional
case (Figure 12.7 and Equation 12.26):

where the closed surface , and  and  are the upper and lower crack faces,
respectively, that are enclosed by S1. From this point, the derivation of the domain integral formu-
lation is essentially identical to the two-dimensional case, except that Equation (12.34) becomes a
volume integral:
(12.37)
Equation (12.37) requires that q = 0 at either end of ∆L; otherwise, there may be a contribution to
J from the end surfaces of the cylinder. The virtual crack advance interpretation of q (Figure 12.9)
fulﬁlls this requirement.
If the point-wise value of the J integral does not vary appreciably over ∆L, to a ﬁrst approxi-
mation, J(h) is given by
(12.38)
Equation (12.38) is a reasonable approximation if the q gradient along the crack front is steep relative
to the variation in J(h).
Recall that Equation (12.22) was deﬁned in terms of a ﬁxed coordinate system, while Equation
(12.37) assumes a local coordinate system. The domain integral formulation can be expressed interms of a ﬁxed coordinate system by replacing q with a vector quantity q
i, and evaluating the
partial derivatives in the integrand with respect to xi rather than x1, where the vectors qi and xi are
parallel to the direction of crack growth. Several commercial codes that incorporate the domainintegral deﬁnition of J require that the q function be deﬁned with respect to a ﬁxed origin.
12.3.3 F INITE ELEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION
Shih et al. [21] and Dodds and Vargas [23] give detailed instructions for implementing the domainintegral approach. Their recommendations are summarized brieﬂy.
In two-dimensional problems, one must deﬁne the area over which the integration is to be
performed. The inner contour Γ
o is often taken as the crack tip, in which case A*corresponds to
the area inside of Γ1. The boundary of Γ1 should coincide with element boundaries. An analogous
situation applies in three dimensions, where it is necessary to deﬁne the volume of integration. Thelatter situation is somewhat more complicated, however, since J(h) is usually evaluated at a number
of locations along the crack front.
The q function must be speciﬁed at all nodes within the area or volume of integration. The shape
of the q  function is arbitrary, as long as q has the correct values on the domain boundaries. In a plane
stress or plane strain problem, for example, q = 1 at Γ
o, which is usually the crack tip, and q = 0 at
the outer boundary. Figure 12.11 illustrates two common examples of q functions for two-dimensional
problems, with the corresponding virtual nodal displacements. This example shows 4-node squareelements and rectangular domains for the sake of simplicity. The pyramid function (Figure 12.11(a))is equal to 1 at the crack tip but varies linearly to zero in all directions, while the plateau function(Figure 12.11(b)) equals 1 in all regions except the outer ring of elements. Shih et al. [21] have shownthat the computed value of J is insensitive to the assumed shape of the q function.SS S S So*=++−+− 1S+S−

where m is the number of Gaussian points per element, and wp and w are weighting factors. The
quantities within { } p are evaluated at the Gaussian points. Note that the integration over crack
faces is necessary only when there are nonzero tractions.
12.4 MESH DESIGN
The design of a ﬁnite element mesh is as much an art as it is a science. Although many commercial
codes have automatic mesh generation capabilities, construction of a properly designed ﬁniteelement model invariably requires some human intervention. Crack problems, in particular, requirea certain amount of judgment on the part of the user.
This section gives a brief overview of some of the considerations that should govern the
construction of a mesh for analysis of crack problems. It is not possible to address in a few pagesall of the situations that may arise. Readers with limited experience in this area should consultthe published literature, which contains numerous examples of ﬁnite element meshes for crackproblems.
Figure 12.13 shows examples of the arrangement of nodes on the crack plane of two-dimensional
models. When both crack faces are modeled, there are usually matching nodes along each crackface. If these matching node pairs have identical coordinates, many commercial mesh generationtools will merge these node pairs into single nodes, which will cause the crack to heal. One techniquefor avoiding this unwanted intervention by commercial meshing tools is to create a small gapbetween the crack faces. The width of this gap should be much less then the crack length. Whenthe crack is on a symmetry plane, which is the case for most Mode I problems, only one crack faceneeds to be modeled. A symmetry constraint is applied to the uncracked cross section, and the crackface is normally unconstrained.

Figure 12.14 illustrates the most common continuum element shapes. The elements depicted
in Figure 12.14 have mid-side nodes, which imply quadratic shape functions, but corresponding
linear elements with nodes only at the element corners are also available. Typical crack analysesuse quadrilateral elements for two-dimensional problems and brick elements for three-dimensionalproblems. Most postprocessing algorithms that evaluate the J integral cannot handle other element
types, such as triangular and tetrahedral elements for two- and three-dimensional problems, respec-tively. Such algorithms typically deﬁne the integration domain by searching outward from the cracktip using the element connectivity matrix. In a well-constructed mesh consisting of quadrilateralor brick elements near the crack tip, a search algorithm using the connectively matrix results inregular, concentric integration domains for evaluating J. With triangular or tetrahedral elements,
however, an unlimited number of elements can be connected to a single node and the elements areoriented arbitrarily. Consequently deﬁning smooth, regular integration domains from the connec-tivity matrix is virtually impossible.
As discussed in Section 12.1.1, elements with mid-side nodes have quadratic shape functions.
Crack meshes usually use 8-node and 20-node quadratic elements for two- and three-dimensionalproblems, respectively. Some practitioners prefer 9-node biquadratic Lagrangian elements for two-dimensional problems and 27-node triquadratic Lagrangian elements in three dimensions. Linearelements, which have 4 and 8 nodes for two- and three-dimensional problems, respectively, arealso acceptable for crack problems, but additional mesh reﬁnement is required to attain the samelevel of accuracy as a corresponding mesh consisting of quadratic elements.
At the crack tip, quadrilateral elements (in two-dimensional problems) are usually collapsed
down to triangles, as Figure 12.15 illustrates. Note that three nodes occupy the same point in space.Figure 12.16 shows the analogous situation for three dimensions, where a brick element is degen-erated to a wedge.
In elastic problems, the nodes at the crack tip are normally tied, and the mid-side nodes moved
to the points (Figure 12.17(a)). Such a modiﬁcation results in a strain singularity in theelement, which enhances numerical accuracy. A similar result can be achieved by moving the mid-side nodes to points in noncollapsed quadrilateral elements, but the singularity would exist onlyFIGURE 12.13 Examples of nodes on the crack plane in two-dimensional ﬁnite element and boundary element
models.

on the element edges [14,24]; collapsed elements are preferable in this case because the singularity
exists within the element as well as on the edges. Appendix 12 presents a mathematical derivationthat explains why moving the mid-side nodes results in the desired singularity for elastic problems.
When a plastic zone forms, the singularity no longer exists at the crack tip. Consequently,
elastic singular elements are not appropriate for elastic-plastic analyses. Figure 12.15(b) shows anelement that exhibits the desired strain singularity under fully plastic conditions. The element isFIGURE 12.16 Degeneration of a brick element into a wedge.

collapsed to a triangle as before, but the crack-tip nodes are untied and the location of the mid-
side nodes is unchanged. This element geometry produces a 1/ r strain singularity, which corresponds
to the actual crack-tip strain ﬁeld for fully plastic, nonhardening materials.
One side beneﬁt of the plastic singular element design is that it allows the CTOD to be computed
from the deformed mesh, as Figure 12.18 illustrates. The untied nodes initially occupy the samepoint in space, but move apart as the elements deform. The CTOD can be inferred from the deformedcrack proﬁle by means of the 90 ° intercept method (Figure 3.4).
For typical problems, the most efﬁcient mesh design for the crack-tip region has proven to be
the “spider-web” conﬁguration, which consists of concentric rings of quadrilateral elements thatare focused toward the crack tip. The elements in the innermost ring are degenerated to triangles,as described above. Since the crack tip region contains steep stress and strain gradients, the meshreﬁnement should be greatest at the crack-tip. The spider-web design facilitates a smooth transitionfrom a ﬁne mesh at the tip to a coarser mesh remote from the tip. In addition, this conﬁgurationresults in a series of smooth, concentric integration domains (contours) for evaluating the J integral.
Figure 12.19 shows a half-symmetric model of a two-dimensional simple cracked body, in whicha spider-web mesh transitions to coarse rectangular elements. The spider-web meshing concept canbe extended to three-dimensional problems. Figure 12.20 shows a quarter-symmetric model of asemielliptical surface crack in a plate.
The appropriate level of mesh reﬁnement depends on the purpose of analysis. Elastic analyses
of stress intensity or energy release rate can be accomplished with relatively coarse meshes sincemodern methods, such as the domain integral approach, eliminate the need to resolve local crack-tip ﬁelds accurately. The area and volume integrations in the newer approaches are relativelyinsensitive to mesh size for elastic problems. The mesh should include singularity elements at thecrack tip, however, when the domain corresponds to the ﬁrst ring of elements at the tip. If thedomain is deﬁned over a larger portion of the mesh, singularity elements are unnecessary becausethe crack tip elements contribute little to J. The relative contribution of the crack-tip elements can
be adjusted through the deﬁnition of the q function. For example, in elastic problems, the crack-
tip elements do not contribute to J when the plateau function (Figure 12.11(b)) is adopted, since
dq/dx
1 = 0 at the crack tip.
Elastic-plastic problems require more mesh reﬁnement in regions of the body where yielding
occurs. When a body experiences net section yielding, narrow deformation bands often propagateacross the specimen (Figure 3.26). The high level of plastic strain in these bands will make aFIGURE 12.18 Deformed shape of plastic singularity elements (Figure 12.17(b)). The crack-tip elements

signiﬁcant contribution to the J integral; the ﬁnite element mesh must be sufﬁciently reﬁned in
these regions to capture this deformation accurately.
When the purpose of the analysis is to analyze crack-tip stresses and strains, a very high level
of mesh reﬁnement is required [25,26]. As a general rule, it is desirable to have at least 10 elements
on a radial line in the region of interest. In addition, if it is necessary to infer crack-tip ﬁelds atdistances less than twice the CTOD from the crack tip, the analysis code must incorporate largestrain theory and a nonlinear geometry kinematic assumption. McMeeking and Parks [26] wereamong the ﬁrst to apply such an analysis to the crack-tip region. Figure 3.13 is a plot of some oftheir results.
Note that the collapsed plastic singular element (Figure 12.17(a)) is not appropriate for analyses
that incorporate nonlinear geometry kinematics. In such analyses, the element stiffness and Jacobianmatrices are recomputed at every step. The ﬁrst ring of collapsed elements at the crack tip canbecome highly distorted as the crack blunts. Severely deformed elements lead to errors andnumerical instabilities. For analyses that assume small geometry changes, element deformation isnot an issue because the element stiffness and Jacobian matrices are determined from the originalconﬁguration.
3
In a large-strain, nonlinear-geometry analysis, it is customary to begin with a ﬁnite radius at
the crack tip, as Figure 12.21 illustrates. Note that the crack-tip elements are not collapsed totriangles in this case. Provided the CTOD after deformation is at least ﬁve times the initial value,the results should not be affected by the initial blunt notch [26].
This chapter does not address boundary conditions in detail, but it is worth mentioning a
common pitfall. Many problems require forces to be applied at the boundaries of the body. Forexample, a single-edge-notched bend specimen is loaded in the three-point bending, with a loadapplied at mid-span, and appropriate restraints at each end. In elastic-plastic problems, the mannerin which the load is applied can be very important. Figure 12.22 shows both acceptable andunacceptable ways of applying this boundary condition. If the load is applied to a single node(Figure 12.22(a)), a local stress and strain concentration will occur, and the element connected tothis node will yield almost immediately. The analysis code will spend an inordinate amount of timesolving a punch indentation problem at this node, while the events of interest may be remote fromFIGURE 12.21 Crack-tip region of a mesh for large strain analysis. Note that the initial crack-tip radius is
ﬁnite and the crack-tip elements are not degenerated.
3 An elastic-plastic analysis assuming small geometry changes predicts stresses that monotonically increase as one approaches
the crack tip because the computation is based on the initial sharp-crack conﬁguration. An analysis that accounts for
geometry changes at the crack tip predicts a peak in normal stress at approximately twice the CTOD (Figure 3.13). Therefore,while a linear geometry analysis using collapsed singularity elements is numerically stable, the stresses are not accurateclose to the crack tip.

the boundary. A better way of applying this boundary condition might be to distribute the load over
several nodes, and specifying that the elements on which the load acts remain elastic(Figure 12.22(b)); the load will then be transferred to the body without wasting computer timesolving a local indentation problem. If, however, the local indentation is of interest, (e.g., if onewants to simulate the effects of the loading ﬁxture) the load can be applied by a rigid or elasticindenter with a ﬁnite radius, as Figure 12.22(c) illustrates. Note, however, that greater meshreﬁnement is required to resolve the plastic deformation at the indenter.
12.5 LINEAR ELASTIC CONVERGENCE STUD Y
In order to demonstrate the effect of mesh reﬁnement and solution technique on the accuracy ofK
I estimates from ﬁnite element analysis, a series of analyses were performed speciﬁcally for this
chapter. These analyses were performed on a through-thickness crack in a ﬂat plate subject to eithera remote membrane stress or a uniform crack face pressure. The plate width was 20 times the cracklength, so the model approximated the so-called Grifﬁth plate, where the width is inﬁnite.
4 This
conﬁguration was chosen because there is a closed-form theoretical solution for KI (Equation (2.41))FIGURE 12.22 Examples of improper (a) and proper (b and c) methods for applying a force to a boundary.
4 According to Equation (2.46) in Chapter 2, the ﬁnite-width correction for a/W = 0.05 is 1.0015, or 0.15% of the inﬁnite
body solution.

with which to compare the ﬁnite element results. Both two- and three-dimensional models of the
through-thickness crack in a wide plate were created for this convergence study.
Figure 12.23 shows the crack-tip region of the baseline two-dimensional model. This model,
which is -symmetric, includes ﬁve concentric rings of elements at the crack tip in the “spider-web” conﬁguration described in the previous section. Two additional models were created in whichnumber of element rings in the crack-tip region was doubled and increased by a factor of 8 relativeto the baseline case. All of the two-dimensional models were constructed of 8-node quadrilateralplane strain elements.
Figure 12.24 is a dimensionless plot of stress-intensity values computed from the baseline
model using the domain integral approach. The J integral was converted to the Mode I stress-
intensity factor through Equation (2.56), and the resulting K
J was normalized by the theoretical
solution for the Grifﬁth plate. The ﬁrst contour corresponds to the ﬁrst ring of elements, the secondcontour comprises the ﬁrst two rings of elements, and so on. Note that the -point node locationin the collapsed elements in the ﬁrst ring improves the J estimate in the ﬁrst contour but has little
effect on the second and higher contours. Also, note that the stress-intensity factor computed fromthe J integral is within 0.3% of the theoretical solution despite the fact that the baseline mesh is
not particularly reﬁned at the crack tip. Therefore, the J-integral method is an efﬁcient way to
compute K
I, in that a high degree of mesh reﬁnement is not required. Also, -point elastic
singularity elements are not necessary, provided the integration domain includes more than just theﬁrst ring of elements.
Figure 12.25 is a plot of K
I estimates from the baseline two-dimensional model using the normal
stress in front of the crack tip (Equation (12.14)). The stress-matching approach results in asigniﬁcant underestimate of K
I in this instance. Moreover, a remote stress and a crack-face pressure
produce vastly different results, despite the fact that KI is the same for both load cases, according
to the principle of superposition (Section 2.6.4). The -point elastic singularity elements improvethe solution slightly.
The displacement-matching approach (Equation (12.15(a)) produces much better estimates of
K
I than the stress-matching method. Figure 12.26 shows a comparison of displacement-based K
estimates for crack-face pressure and remote loading. There is virtually no difference between theFIGURE 12.23 Close-up of the crack tip region of the baseline quarter-symmetric two-dimensional plane

two load cases. If the results for the ﬁrst two nodes are disregarded, the extrapolation results in a KI
estimate that is within 2% of the theoretical solution. The results in Figure 12.26 were obtained from
the baseline mesh with -point elastic singularity elements. Figure 12.27 compares these resultswith those from a mesh where the ﬁrst ring of collapsed elements had mid-side rather than -pointnodes. The elastic singularity elements improve the K
I estimate by 1–2% in the baseline model.
Figure 12.28 illustrates the effect of mesh reﬁnement on KI estimates from the stress-matching
method. Increasing the number of element rings near the crack-tip improves the solution, but therate of convergence is very slow. Even when the crack tip mesh is reﬁned by a factor of 8 comparedto the baseline model, the stress-matching method results in signiﬁcant errors in K
I estimates.
Theoretically, the KI estimate should approach the correct value with sufﬁcient mesh reﬁnement,
but the level of reﬁnement required for acceptable accuracy is much larger than is necessary forboth the J integral and displacement methods.
Figure 12.29 shows the results of the mesh reﬁnement convergence study for K
I estimates from
crack-opening displacement. As one would expect, mesh reﬁnement results in improved estimatesfrom extrapolation. However, the results from the ﬁrst few nodes must be excluded from theextrapolation in order to obtain good estimates.
Some commercial ﬁnite element programs include an option to compute stress-intensity factors
from nodal displacements behind the crack. However, it is risky to place blind trust in suchalgorithms. As Figure 12.29 illustrates, the K
I estimate can be signiﬁcantly affected by the choice
of nodes that are selected for the extrapolation to r = 0. For example, if the computation is based
on the displacements of the ﬁrst two nodes behind the crack tip, signiﬁcant errors can result. Themost reliable approach is to extract and plot the results for all crack-face nodes that are relativelyclose to the crack tip, and then determine which points should be used in the extrapolation.

For a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3, the KJ in the center of the plate is approximately 5% greater than the
theoretical solution for the Grifﬁth plate. The classical solution is obtained when Poisson’s ratio is
set to zero. The results for ν = 0.3 manifest a real three-dimensional effect. The theoretical solution
for the Grifﬁth plate is based on a two-dimensional body (plane stress or plane strain), so it cannotaccount for variations of stress and strain along the crack front. When ν = 0, the three-dimensional
model behaves like a two-dimensional plate because there is no out-of-plane deformation.
The effect of mesh reﬁnement along the crack front in the three-dimensional analysis was
investigated. Figure 12.32 shows models where the crack front was reﬁned by factors of 3 and 9.The resulting K
J solutions are plotted in Figure 12.33. The KJ value in the center of the plate is insensitive
to crack-front reﬁnement, but the value on the free surface continually decreases with reﬁnement along thecrack front.
The results in Figure 12.33 further illustrate the difference between two-dimensional and three-
dimensional solutions for cracks. Not only does the K
J value at midthickness differ from the classical
solution, the computed free surface value is mesh dependent. As discussed in Section 12.3.2, theJ integral computed at a given point on the crack front in a three-dimensional model actuallycorresponds to a weighted average over a ﬁnite crack-front length. For the node at the free surface,J is typically computed over a domain that is one element thick. For reasons described below, the
theoretical value of the J integral on the free surface of a three-dimensional body is zero . Therefore,
the computed J value for the node corresponding to where the crack front intersects a free surface
will continually decrease with increasing crack-front reﬁnement.
5FIGURE 12.31 Through-thickness variation of the Mode I stress-intensity factor inferred from a J-integral
analysis of the three-dimensional model in Figure 12.30.
5 The theoretical value of J on the free surface is of little practical importance because crack propagation is governed by
the crack driving force over a ﬁnite distance below the surface. Consider, for example, a semielliptical surface crack of
depth a and length 2 c that is growing by fatigue. The fatigue crack growth rate on the free surface da/dN, appears to be
governed by the nominal ∆K near  the free surface. Otherwise, we would observe no crack growth on the free surface and
the crack would “tunnel” in the c direction below the surface.

A crack intersecting a free surface in a three-dimensional body forms a corner. Such a conﬁg-
uration is decidedly different from a crack in a two-dimensional plane stress model. The corner
results in a singularity, but stress varies as power of r that is for an elastic body. It can be
shown that the stress singularity in an elastic material must vary as in order for J to be nonzero.

leading singular term in each series contributes to J. In both the elastic and fully plastic series
solutions, the product of stress times strain varies as 1/ r in the leading singular term.
In summary, the domain integral method is the most efﬁcient means to infer stress-intensity
factors solutions from ﬁnite element analysis. If one’s ﬁnite element software does not include such
capabilities, the displacement-matching technique is an acceptable alternative, provided the meshreﬁnement is sufﬁcient for convergence. The stress-matching method requires a very high level ofmesh reﬁnement, so it is not recommended. Finally, the level of mesh reﬁnement required forconvergence is problem-speciﬁc, since it depends on the geometry and loading. The convergenceresults presented here are for purposes of illustration and should not be used as the sole basis fordemonstrating convergence for a different problem.
12.6 ANAL YSIS OF GROWING CRACKS
Although most computational fracture mechanics analyses are performed on stationary cracks,there are instances where it is desirable to analyze crack growth. Growing a crack in a ﬁnite elementmodel often requires a special meshing strategy, and the analysis must include a criterion forcrack advance.
The ﬁnite element models shown in previous sections all have focused meshes , where the
highest level of mesh reﬁnement is at the crack tip. The so-called spider-web conﬁguration is anexample of a focused mesh. This type of mesh is suitable for the analysis of a stationary crack,but is not appropriate for crack growth unless the focused region moves with the crack tip. Movingthe crack tip in a focused mesh normally entails re-meshing. That is, a new focused mesh with aslightly longer crack must be created. Re-meshing is appropriate for elastic problems because stressand strain are not history dependent. For example, fatigue in an elastic body can be modeled byFIGURE 12.33 Effect of crack-front reﬁnement on the through-thickness variation of KJ.
1656_C012.fm  Page 585  Monday, May 23, 2005  6:07 PM
586 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
computing the stress-intensity range at each time step, and then updating the crack dimensions
(with a new mesh) based on the desired growth law. 
In elastic-plastic materials, stress and strain are history dependent. Crack growth by re-meshing
is possible in principle, provided the prior plastic strain history is properly mapped onto the variousmodels created at each step. However, this approach is highly cumbersome. A better alternativeis to create a single mesh that accommodates crack growth. One such mesh conﬁguration is thecell mesh . Figure 12.34 shows an example of a cell mesh for a semielliptical surface crack. Rather
than a focused reﬁned zone at the crack tip, there are reﬁned bands (or cells) of elements thatcorrespond to the crack-front positions at various stages during the analysis. The disadvantage ofthis conﬁguration is that the crack path and shape are predetermined by the mesh pattern.
There are three common methods to advance a crack in a cell mesh. Elements along the crack
front can be removed from the model once a failure criterion is reached. For example, ductile crackgrowth can be simulated in a cell mesh using the Gurson–Tvergaard plasticity model described inChapter 5 [27–29]. Another approach is to release nodes at speciﬁc load steps or according to afailure criterion. A third method entails using cohesive elements, which are zero-thickness elementson which a force-displacement law can be speciﬁed [30]. In a typical force-displacement curve forcohesive elements, the force reaches a maximum value at an intermediate displacement, and thendecreases to zero with further displacement. The crack “unzips” as cohesive elements along thecrack front progressively fail.
Irrespective of the numerical crack growth strategy (removing elements, releasing nodes, using
cohesive elements) each increment of crack advance corresponds to the element size. For this reasonthe crack growth response in a ﬁnite element simulation is mesh dependent. In real materials, thecrack growth response (e.g., the J resistance curve) depends on material length scales such as
inclusion spacing. A ﬁnite element continuum model does not include microstructural features suchas inclusions, so element size is the only available length scale to govern crack growth. Crackgrowth simulations usually need to be tuned to match experimental data. One of the key tuningparameters is the element size in the cell zone on the crack plane.FIGURE 12.34 Cell-type mesh for analysis of crack growth in a semielliptical surface crack in a ﬂat plate.
Note the difference between this mesh conﬁguration and the focused mesh in Figure 12.20. The concentric
mesh lines on the crack plane correspond to various crack-front positions during the analysis.

APPENDIX 12: PROPERTIES OF SINGULARITY ELEMENTS
Certain element/node conﬁgurations produce strain singularities. While such behavior is undesirable
for most analyses, it is ideal for elastic crack problems. Forcing the elements at the crack tip to exhibita  strain singularity can improve accuracy and reduces the need for a high degree of meshreﬁnement at the crack tip. Note that the strain is singular only at the node point at the crack tip. Overthe interior of the element, the strain varies as . Consequently, the strain is ﬁnite at the gausspoints, where it is actually evaluated in the solution.
The derivations that follow show that the desired singularity can be produced in quadratic
isoparametric elements by moving the mid-side nodes to the -points. This behavior was ﬁrstnoted by Barsoum [14] and Henshell and Shaw [24].
From Equation (12.3) and Equation (12.4), the strain matrix for a two-dimensional element
can be written in the following form:
(A12.1)
where
(A12.2)
where ( x, h) are the parametric coordinates of a point on the element. Since the nodal displacements
{u
i, vi} are bounded, the strain matrix can be singular only if either [ B*] or [J]−1 is singular.
Consider an 8-noded quadratic isoparametric two-dimensional element (Figure 12.12(a)). The
shape functions for this element are as follows [4]:
(A12.3)
where ( x, h) are the parametric coordinates of a point in the element and ( xi, hi) are the coordinates
of the ith node.
In general, the shape functions are polynomials. Equation (A12.3), for example, is a quadratic
equation. Thus Ni, ∂Ni/∂x, or ∂ Ni/∂h are all nonsingular, and [ J] must be the cause of the singularity.
A strain singularity can arise if the determinant of the Jacobian matrix vanishes at the crack tip:

Consider an 8-noded quadrilateral element with the mid-side nodes at the point, as Figure A12.1illustrates. For convenience, the origin of the x-y global coordinate system is placed at node 1.

which vanishes at x = 0; thus the strain must be singular at this point. Considering only the
displacements of points 1, 2, and 5, the displacements along the element edge are as follows:
(A12.10)
Substituting Equation (A12.8) into Equation (A12.10) gives
(A12.11)
Solving for the strain in the x direction leads to
(A12.12)
Therefore, the strain exhibits a singularity along the element boundary.
A12.2 TRIANGULAR ELEMENT
Let us now construct a triangular element by collapsing nodes 1, 4, and 8 (Figure A12.2). Nodes
5 and 7 are moved to the quarter points in this case. The strain singularity exists along the1-5-2 and 4-7-3 edges, as with the quadrilateral element. In this instance, however, the singularityalso exists within the element.

Consider the x axis, where h = 0. The relationship between x and x  is given by
(A12.13)
where L1 is the length of the element in the x direction. Solving for x gives
(A12.14)
which is identical to Equation (A12.8). Therefore, the strain is singular along the x axis in this
element. By solving for strain as before (Equation (A12.10) to Equation (A12.12)) it can easily be
shown that the singularity is the desired  type.

Practice Problems 
This chapter contains practice problems that correspond to material in Chapter 1 to Chapter 12.
Some of the problems for Chapter 7 to Chapter 11 require a computer program or spreadsheet.This level of complexity was necessary in order to make the application-oriented problems realistic.
All quantitative data are given in SI units, although the corresponding values in English units
are also provided in many cases. 
13.1CHAPTER 1 
1.1 Compile a list of ﬁve mechanical or structural failures that have occurred within the
last 20 years. Describe the factors that led to each failure and identify the failures thatresulted from misapplication of existing knowledge (Type 1) and those that involvednew technology or a signiﬁcant design modiﬁcation (Type 2).
1.2 A ﬂat plate with a through-thickness crack (Figure 1.8) is subject to a 100 MPa (14.5 ksi)
tensile stress and has a fracture toughness ( 
K 
Ic 
) of 50.0 MPa (45.5 ksi .). Deter-
mine the critical crack length for this plate, assuming the material is linear elastic.
1.3 Compute the critical energy release rate ( 
G 
c 
) of the material in the previous problem for 
E 
  
= 
 207,000 MPa (30,000 ksi).
1.4 Suppose that you plan to drop a bomb out of an airplane and that you are interested in
the time of ﬂight before it hits the ground, but you cannot remember the appropriateequation from your undergraduate physics course. You decide to infer a relationship fortime of ﬂight of a falling object by experimentation. You reason that the time of ﬂight,  
t 
,
must depend on the height above the ground,  
h 
, and the weight of the object,  
mg 
, where 
m 
 is the mass and  
g 
 is the gravitational acceleration. Therefore, neglecting aerodynamic
drag, the time of ﬂight is given by the following function:
Apply dimensional analysis to this equation and determine how many experiments
would be required to determine the function  
f 
 to a reasonable approximation, assuming
you know the numerical value of  
g 
. Does the time of ﬂight depend on the mass of the
object? 
13.2CHAPTER 2 
2.1 According to Equation (2.25), the energy required to increase the crack area a unit
amount is equal to  
twice 
 the fracture work per unit surface area,  
w 
f 
. Why is the factor
of 2 in this equation necessary?
2.2 Derive Equation (2.30) for both load control and displacement control by substituting
Equation (2.29) into Equation (2.27) and Equation (2.28), respectively.
2.3 Figure 2.10 illustrates that the driving force is linear for a through-thickness crack in
an inﬁnite plate when the stress is ﬁxed. Suppose that a remote displacement (ratherthan load) were ﬁxed in this conﬁguration. Would the driving force curves be altered?Explain. (

Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications 
2.4 A plate 2 
W 
 wide contains a centrally located crack 2 
a 
 long and is subject to a tensile
load  
P 
. Beginning with Equation (2.24), derive an expression for the elastic compliance 
C 
 ( 
= 
  
∆ 
/ 
P 
) in terms of the plate dimensions and elastic modulus  
E 
. The stress in Equation
(2.24) is the nominal value, i.e.,  
s 
  
= 
  
P 
/2

 in this problem. ( 
Note: 
 Equation (2.24)
only applies when  
a 
 <<  
W 
; the expression you derive is only approximate for a ﬁnite-
width plate.)
2.5 A material exhibits the following crack growth resistance behavior:
where  
a 
o 
 is the initial crack size.  
R 
 has units of kJ/m 
2 
 and crack size is in millimeters.
Alternatively,
where  
R 
 has units of in.-lb/in. 
2 
 and crack size is in inches. The elastic modulus of this
material  
= 
 207,000 MPa (30,000 ksi). Consider a wide plate with a through crack ( 
a 
 <<  
W 
)
that is made from this material.
(a) If this plate fractures at 138 MPa (20.0 ksi), compute the following:
(i) The half crack size at failure ( 
a 
c 
)
(ii) The amount of stable crack growth (at each crack tip) that precedes failure ( 
a 
c 
  
− 
 a 
o 
)
(b) If this plate has an initial crack length (2 
a 
o 
) of 50.8 mm (2.0 in.) and the plate is
loaded to failure, compute the following:
(i) The stress at failure
(ii) The half crack size at failure
(iii) The stable crack growth at each crack tip
2.6 Suppose that a double cantilever beam specimen (Figure 2.9) is fabricated from the
same material considered in Problem 2.5. Calculate the load at failure and the amountof stable crack growth. The specimen dimensions are as follows:

 25.4 mm (1 in.); 
h 
  
= 
 12.7 mm (0.5 in.); 
a 
o

2.7 Consider a nominally linear elastic material with a rising  
R 
 curve (e.g., Problem 2.5
and Problem 2.6). Suppose that one test is performed on wide plate with a throughcrack (Figure 2.3) and a second test on the same material is performed on a doublecantilever beam (DCB) specimen (Figure 2.9). If both tests are conducted in load control,would the  
G 
c 
values at instability be the same? If not, which geometry would result in
a higher  
G 
c 
? Explain. 
2.8 Example 2.3 showed that the energy release rate  
G 
 of the DCB specimen increases with
crack growth when the specimen is held at a constant load. Describe (qualitatively)how you could alter the design of the DCB specimen such that a growing crack in loadcontrol would experience a constant  
G 
.
2.9 Beginning with Equation (2.20), derive an expression for the potential energy of a plate
subject to a tensile stress  
s 
 with a penny-shaped ﬂaw of radius  
a

2.10 Beginning with Equation (2.20), derive expressions for the energy release rate and Mode

that can be represented by the following crack-face traction:
where po = 300 MPa and b = 25 mm. The origin ( x = 0) is at the left crack tip, as
illustrated in Figure 2.27. Using the weight function derived in Example 2.6, calculate

The stress intensity of this specimen conﬁguration can be expressed as follows:

4.1 A high rate fracture toughness test is to be performed on a high strength steel with
KId = 110 MPa  (100 ksi .). A three-point bend specimen will be used, with W
= 50.8 mm (2.0 in.), a/W = 0.5, B = W/2, and span = 4W. Also, c1 = 5940 m/sec (19,500

600 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
5.3 The critical microstructural feature for cleavage initiation in a steel sample is a 6.67
µm diameter spherical carbide; failure occurs when this particle forms a microcrack
that satisﬁes the Grifﬁth criterion (Equation (5.18)), where gp = 14 J/m2, E = 207,000
MPa, and n = 0.30 for the material. Assuming Figure 5.14 describes the stress distri-
bution ahead of the macroscopic crack, where so = 350 MPa, estimate the critical J
value of the sample if the particle is located 0.1 mm ahead of the crack tip, on the crackplane. Repeat this calculation for the case where the critical particle is 0.4 mm aheadof the crack tip.
5.4 Cleavage initiates in a ferritic steel at 3.0 µm diameter spherical particles. The fracture
energy on a single grain, g
p, is 14 J/m2 and the fracture energy required for propagation
across grain boundaries, ggb, is 50 J/m2. At what grain size does propagation across
grain boundaries become the controlling step for cleavage fracture?
5.5 Compute the relative size of the 90% conﬁdence band of KIc data (as in Example 5.1),
assuming Equation (5.24) describes the toughness distribution. Compute the conﬁdencebandwidth for K
o/ΘK = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0. What is the effect of the threshold
toughness Ko on the relative scatter? What is the physical signiﬁcance of ΘK in this case?
5.6 Compute the relative size of the 90% conﬁdence band of KIc data (as in Example 5.1),
assuming Equation (5.26) describes the toughness distribution. Compute the conﬁdencebandwidth for K
o/ΘK = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0. What is the effect of the threshold
toughness Ko on the relative scatter?
13.6 CHAPTER 6
6.1 For the Maxwell spring and dashpot model (Figure 6.6) derive an expression for the
relaxation modulus.
6.2 Fill in the missing steps in the derivation of Equation (6.14).6.3 At room temperature, tensile specimens of polycarbonate show 60% elongation and no
stress whitening, while thick compact specimens used in fracture toughness testingshow stress whitening at the crack tip. Explain these observations. Polycarbonate is anamorphous glassy polymer at room temperature.
6.4 A wide and thin specimen of PMMA has a 15 mm (0.59 in.) long through crack with
a 1.5 mm (0.059 in.) long craze at each crack tip. If the applied stress is 3.5 MPa (508psi), calculate the crazing stress in this material.
6.5 When a macroscopic crack grows in a ceramic specimen, a process zone 0.2 mm wide
forms. This process zone contains 10,000 penny-shaped microcracks/mm
3 with an
average radius of 10 µm. Estimate the increase in toughness due to the release of strain
energy by these microcracks. The surface energy of the material = 25 J/m2.

Determine the largest valid KIc value that can be measured on this material.
8.3 A KIc test is to be performed on a polymer with a time-dependent relaxation modulus
that has been ﬁt to the following equation:
where E is in GPa and t is in seconds. Assuming PQ is determined from a 5% secant
construction, estimate the test duration (i.e., the time to reach PQ) at which 90% of the
nonlinearity in the load-displacement curve at PQ is due to viscoelastic effects. Does
the 5% secant load give an appropriate indication of material toughness in this case?
Explain.
8.4 Derive a relationship between the conventional J integral and the isochronous J integral,

Calculate the time to failure in this plate assuming remote tensile stresses of 5 and
10 MPa (1 ksi = 6.897 MPa). Comment on the sensitivity of the time to failure on the
applied stress. (As a ﬁrst approximation, neglect the ﬁnite width correction on K. For
an optional exercise, repeat the calculations with this correction to assess its effect onthe computed failure times.)

The nuts and bolts are made from a high-strength alloy steel witha yield strength of 1100 MPa (160 ksi). They are to be tightened to a very high torque,such that the stresses in the nuts and bolts are close to yield. The nuts and bolts willnot be exposed to the crude oil, but will be immersed in a seawater environment. Inorder to mitigate corrosion, the riser will be ﬁtted with sacriﬁcial anodes.

men. At the start of the test, the applied K
I was 20 MPa  and the crack growth rate was
5.00 × 10−6 m/sec and at the end of the test, KI was 10 MPa  and da/dt was 1.00
× 10−10 m/sec. A 1T specimen was used, with W = 50.8 mm (2.0 in.). At the start of the
test, a/W = 0.45. The table below gives the computed crack growth rate vs. applied KI.
(a) Compute the crack-opening displacement, V required to achieve KI = 20 MPa  at
the start of the test.
(b) Assuming V remains constant throughout the test, compute the ﬁnal a/W at the
conclusion of the test.
(c) Given the crack growth data tabulated in the given table, compute and plot crack
size vs. time. How long did it take to run this test?da

13.12 CHAPTER 12
12.1 A series of ﬁnite element meshes have been generated that model compact specimens
with various crack lengths. Plane stress linear elastic analyses have been performed on
these models. Nondimensional compliance values as a function of a/W are tabulated in
the given table. Estimate the nondimensional stress intensity for the compact specimenfrom these data and compare your estimates to the polynomial solution in Table 13.2.
12.2 A two-dimensional plane strain ﬁnite element analysis is performed on a through crack in
a wide plate (Figure 2.3). The remote stress is 100 MPa, and the half-crack length = 25
mm. The stress normal to the crack plane ( s
yy) at q = 0 is determined at node points near
the crack tip and is tabulated in the given table. Estimate KI by means of the stress-matching
approach (Equation (12.14)) and compare your estimate to the exact solution for thisgeometry. Is the mesh reﬁnement sufﬁcient to obtain an accurate solution in this case?KI(MPa ) da/dt(m/sec) KI(MPa ) da/dt(m/sec)

610 Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications
12.3 Displacements at nodes along the upper crack face ( uy at q = p) in the previous problem
are tabulated in the given table. The elastic constants are as follows: E = 208,000 MPa
and n = 0.3. Estimate KI by means of the (plane strain) displacement-matching approach
(Equation (12.15a)) and compare your estimate to the exact solution for this geometry.
Is the mesh reﬁnement sufﬁcient to obtain an accurate solution in this case?
12.4 Figure 13.5 illustrates a one-dimensional element with three nodes. Consider two cases:
(1) Node 2 at x = 0.50L and (2) Node 2 at x = 0.25L.
(a) Determine the relationship between the global and parametric coordinates, x(x), in
each case.
(b) Compute the axial strain e(x) for each case in terms of the nodal displacements and
parametric coordinate.
(c) Show that x2 = 0.25L leads to a singularity in the axial strain.(a) (b)
